# Fishwrap.org Brand Bible: The Editor-in-Chief (Digital Origami)

## 1. Brand Mission & Vision
**Mission:** To empower individuals to reclaim agency over their information diet by providing transparent, auditable, and customizable news engines.
**Vision:** A future where the "feed that ends" is the norm, and every reader is their own Editor-in-Chief, free from algorithmic anxiety.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy: The Origami Paradox & The Anxiety of the Thumbs Down

Fishwrap stands on a deliberate paradox: we apply cutting-edge engineering to the humble, ephemeral nature of "fishwrap" (newsprint). Our inspiration is rooted in Neal Stephenson's "The Diamond Age," where a curated newspaper is a sign of societal advancement.

*   **The Problem (The Anxiety of the Thumbs Down):** Modern algorithmic feeds (Google News, social media) create fear. Users are afraid to give feedback because the "black box" consequences are opaque and potentially catastrophic. A "thumbs down" on a celebrity article might silence an entire political topic.
*   **The Fishwrap Solution (Granular Consent):** We don't ask for "thumbs down." We ask for an "Editor's Note." Our system empowers users with transparent rules: "Penalty: 'Golf' (-20). Boost: 'Executive Order' (+20)." This exposes the logic, makes it reversible, and restores agency.

## 3. Core Principles (The Pillars of the Glass Box)

*   **Transparency (The Glass Box):** Every decision is auditable. Trust through clarity.
*   **Agency (Granular Consent):** Users curate their reality without fear.
*   **Intentionality (The Anti-Feed):** Finiteness is a feature, not a limitation. Quality over infinite scroll.
*   **Empowerment (Editor-in-Chief):** The user defines their news, their way.

## 6. Visual Language & Whimsical Flavor: "Digital Origami"

We lean into the irony of the name "Fishwrap" by applying elegant, precise engineering to humble newsprint, creating a "Digital Origami" aesthetic.

*   **Logo & Primary Motif: The Origami Fish**
    *   **Concept:** A sleek, geometric origami fish. It literally depicts "Fish" and "Paper" while being modern and sharp.
    *   **Vibe:** Technical (clean lines, geometric) and playful (folded paper, a fish).
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Deep Ocean Blue (`#0f172a`):** The "Tech/Architect" base. Professional, modern, dark mode friendly.
    *   **Newsprint Cream (`#fdfbf7`):** The connection to `dailyclamour.com`'s paper texture.
    *   **Salmon/Coral (`#ff7f50`):** The "Fish" accent color. Vibrant, warm, used for highlights, CTAs, and a touch of urgent playfulness.
*   **Typography:**
    *   **Headlines/Code:** Modern **Monospace** (e.g., *JetBrains Mono*, *Fira Code*). Signals precision and code.
    *   **Body:** Clean, legible **Sans-Serif** (e.g., *Inter*, *Roboto*). Accessible.
    *   **Philosophical Quotes:** A tasteful **Serif** (e.g., *Merriweather*, *Lora*) for a touch of classic gravitas and to echo the "Neo-Victorian" feel.
*   **Web Experience ("The Blueprint"):**
    *   **Documentation Theme:** Clean, high-contrast theme (like Just the Docs).
    *   **Visuals:** Subtle grid patterns, clear sectioning. Icons that feel like old-school technical drawings (magnifying glass, gears, filters, focused eye).
    *   **Microcopy:** Engaging phrases elevating the mundane:
        *   "Your Dashboard: The Newsroom Control Panel"
        *   "Configure Feeds: Chart Your Sources"
        *   "Feedback Loop: Author Your Rules"
        *   "The Manifesto: Our Declaration of Independence from the Algorithm"
    *   **Imagery:** "Victorian Patent Drawings" of software architecture (e.g., an etched diagram of the "News Filtering Engine").

This unified brand bridges the seemingly disparate concepts of "fishwrap" and "enlightened architecture" into a witty, confident, and distinct identity for Fishwrap.org.

## 7. Generative AI Prompts (Brand Assets)

These prompts are designed to generate the core visual assets for the Fishwrap brand using tools like Google AI Studio / Imagen.

### A. Main Logo (The Digital Origami Fish)
```text
Create a sophisticated, minimalist, and geometric logo for 'Fishwrap'. The core concept is 'Digital Origami' – precise engineering applied to information.

The logo should feature a stylized, abstract **origami fish** as its central motif.
- **Style:** Modern, geometric, clean lines, high contrast. Avoid cartoonish or overly simplistic designs. Think elegant folding patterns, not a cartoon.
- **Color Palette:**
    - Primary: Deep Ocean Blue (#0F172A) - for the main structure.
    - Accent: Salmon/Coral (#FF7F50) - for subtle highlights, lines, or a single folded edge.
    - Neutral: Newsprint Cream (#FDFBF7) - as background or a subtle paper texture.
- **Composition:** The fish should feel dynamic but structured, suggesting movement, but also precision. It should evoke filtering, processing, or a neatly folded artifact.
- **Associated Elements:** Subtly integrate elements that suggest data flow, filtering, or a lens/aperture. The fish could subtly form or interact with a stylized 'F'.
- **Typography:** Use a modern monospace font (e.g., JetBrains Mono, Fira Code) for 'Fishwrap' text.

**Output:** Generate multiple variations in PNG/SVG format, showing the logo alone and with the 'Fishwrap' text.
```

### B. Visual Metaphor (Neo-Victorian Patent Drawing)
```text
Generate an intricate, detailed illustration in the style of a **Neo-Victorian Patent Drawing** or **Steampunk Blueprint**. This illustration should visually represent the internal workings of the 'Fishwrap' engine.

- **Subject:** Depict an abstract 'News Filtering and Processing Engine'. Show elements that suggest:
    - **Input:** Chaotic flow of information (perhaps abstract 'waves' or 'streams' of text/data).
    - **Filtering/Processing:** Gears, cogs, levers, precise mechanical arms, an optical lens (the 'Aperture'), perhaps subtle circuitry.
    - **Output:** Neatly organized, folded paper artifacts (the 'Fishwrap' editions) or a stack of clean newspapers.
- **Style:**
    - Monochromatic or duotone (sepia tones, or deep blue lines on a cream background).
    - Hand-drawn or etched aesthetic, cross-hatching for shading, detailed labels (in a technical serif font) for abstract concepts like 'Fetcher', 'Editor', 'Scoring Logic', 'Printer'.
    - Clean lines, but with a slight 'aged blueprint' texture.
- **Tone:** Scientific, detailed, a bit whimsical, hinting at complex precision. It should evoke 'The Glass Box' – transparent and auditable machinery.
- **Color Palette:** Dominated by Newsprint Cream (#FDFBF7) background with Deep Ocean Blue (#0F172A) or Sepia for lines and details. Use Salmon/Coral (#FF7F50) sparingly for emphasis on one key component.
```

### C. Iconography Set (Minimalist Line Art)
```text
Create a set of minimalist, line-art icons for the 'Fishwrap' documentation. The style should be clean, modern, and geometric, fitting the 'Digital Origami' aesthetic.

- **Icon Subjects:**
    1.  **Magnifying Glass:** (Transparency/Audit)
    2.  **Gear/Cog:** (Engine/Process)
    3.  **Filter/Funnel:** (Filtering/Refinement)
    4.  **Sorted List/Stack of Papers:** (Order/Finiteness)
    5.  **Target/Crosshairs:** (Precision/Tuning)
    6.  **Eye/Lens:** (Vision/Aperture)
    7.  **Pen Nib/Quill:** (Editor-in-Chief/Curate)
    8.  **Lightbulb:** (Insight/Idea)
- **Style:** Pure line art (no fills), single stroke weight, sharp corners or very subtle rounding. Geometric.
- **Color:** Deep Ocean Blue (#0F172A) lines on a Newsprint Cream (#FDFBF7) background, or Salmon/Coral (#FF7F50) for an accent.
