Courtesy of Kevin Lee</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>\n\n<p>The Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA), the nation\u2019s peak water body, says data centre developers are seeking about 5 to 40 million litres of water per day to cool down their facilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That\u2019s the equivalent of 70,000 to 80,000 households or 16 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data centres, which store information for governments to businesses, cycle water through their facilities to cool down servers and prevent overheating.</p>\n\n<p>However, the development of AI, which has much higher computational power, storage, as well as electricity needs, is also driving up the base requirements of data centres.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the WSAA estimates that by 2030, data centres in Sydney alone are estimated to use 10.5 billion litres a year (1.9 percent of Sydney Water\u2019s supply).</p>\n\n<p>By 2035, this is expected to balloon to 90 billion litres a year, the equivalent of 15 to 20 percent of supply.</p>\n\n<p>Sydney is arguably the tech capital of Australia with 90 data centres currently in the state of New South Wales (NSW), followed by 40 in Victoria. Future data centre developments could be much larger and energy-intensive, the report says.</p>\n\n<p>Adam Lovell, executive director of WSAA, stressed the need for Australia to plan its water use carefully.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cAustralia is well positioned to become a global data centre hub, and that needn\u2019t be at the expense of our water resources</strong>,\u201d Lovell said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe key is to help the sector become smart water users.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have a history in Australia of developing innovative solutions to make sure industrial users through to residential consumers have reliable access to water supplies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The report contained five recommendations, including implementing efficiency standards, recycling water, more transparency by publishing metric on water and energy use, early collaboration between data centres and water utilities, and creating new frameworks for developments.</p>\n\n<h2>Greens MP Airs Concerns About Data Centre Water Needs</h2>\n\n<p>Abigail Boyd, Greens MP of the NSW Legislative Council, raised concerns about data centre water use in late November.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe latest Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal [IPART] determination for Sydney water prices notes that Sydney Water estimates that the water needs of data centres may be up to 250 megalitres per day by 2035 to fuel the explosion of artificial intelligence products,\u201d she said during Question Time in NSW Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThat would be almost 20 percent of Sydney Water\u2019s total water usage being consumed by data centres ...\u201d she said (<a href=\"https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1820781676-102321/link/2257\">pdf</a>).</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is the minister doing to advocate for <strong>a more responsible approach to artificial intelligence and data centre development so that new infrastructure, like water connections</strong>, is appropriately prioritised towards housing and is not fuelling the latest tech bubble?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In response, Rose Jackson, Labor minister of water and housing, said Sydney Water had not prioritised capital investment for data centres and that housing targets were the priority.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe government is having collaborative conversations with Sydney Water and energy providers because some of the pressures that the member has identified in relation to water also relate to energy and ensuring that New South Wales is open for business and supporting the future economic needs of the tech sector,\u201d Jackson said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe want New South Wales to be a place where investment occurs so that we are at the cutting edge of emergent technology, and we can take advantage of it,\u201d she added.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Sydney Water is exploring a number of innovative opportunities to ensure that data centre development can be supported without putting pressure on the prioritised capital delivery for housing</strong>,\u201d the minister said, noting that the water needs of data centres could also change as technology improves.</p>\n\n<p>Federal and state ministers are expected to discuss the country\u2019s growing water demands in Brisbane on Dec. 12 amid the government\u2019s newly released artificial intelligence plan.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T00:15:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Tue, 12/09/2025 - 19:15</span>\n",

The tragedy unfolded roughly three hours after he began communicating with someone who contacted him via text message around 4:30 p.m.</p>\n\n<p>His father, Adam Tate, has concluded that his son fell victim to a sophisticated extortion operation. Details shared with the Post indicate that <strong>the scheme began with photographs that were not artificially generated but rather appeared to show an actual girl who had previously been victimized herself.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Such schemes follow a well-established pattern, where criminals solicit explicit images from their targets, then threaten to share those images with the victim's social circle unless a ransom is paid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The extortionists demanded $500 from Bryce, according to his father.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"My son had 30 freaking dollars and he's like, 'Sir, I'll give you my last $30.' And these cowards wouldn't take it,\" Tate told The Post.</p>\n\n<p>The scammers appear to have done their homework, compiling detailed information about the teenager's daily life to create a convincing facade.</p>\n\n<p>\"<strong>They acted like a local 17-year-old girl. They knew which gym he worked out at, they knew a couple of his best friends and name-dropped them. They knew he played basketball for Nitro High School</strong>,\" Tate explained. \"They built his trust to where he believed that this was truly somebody in this area.\"</p>\n\n<p>Tate also rejects the characterization of his son's death as simply a suicide.</p>\n\n<p>\"They say it's suicide, but in my book it is 100% murder,\" he said. \"<strong>They're godless demons</strong>, in my opinion. Just cowards, awful individuals, worse than criminals.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>During the last 20 minutes of his life, Bryce was bombarded with roughly 120 messages.</strong> Law enforcement officials explained to his father that this tactic creates \"tunnel vision to where you can't set your phone down,\" trapping victims in a spiral of panic and fear.</p>\n\n<p>Bradford Arick, a public affairs specialist with the FBI, told The Post that \"The FBI has seen a huge increase in the number of sextortion cases involving children and teens being threatened and coerced into sending explicit images online.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to a representative from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children who spoke with the Post, the organization logged more than 33,000 sextortion reports involving children in 2024 alone. The first half of 2025 has seen comparable numbers.</p>\n\n<p>While the FBI would not discuss the particulars of Bryce's case, citing an active investigation, the messages he received bear the hallmarks of a criminal enterprise known as 764\u2014an international operation with tentacles reaching into Russia, Europe, Africa and the United States.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Earlier this month, the Department of Justice announced indictments against five individuals in the United States connected to Greggy's Cult, a 764 affiliate.</strong> Among those charged was an active-duty member of the Navy.</p>\n\n<p>The FBI previously characterized 764 as a \"violent online network that seeks to destroy civilized society through the corruption and exploitation of vulnerable populations, which often include minors.\"</p>\n\n<p>In April, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/leaders-764-arrested-and-charged-operating-global-child-exploitation-enterprise\">minced</a> no words in describing the organization, calling it \"one of the most heinous online child exploitation enterprises we have ever encountered \u2014 a network built on terror, abuse and the deliberate targeting of children.\"</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-09T23:50:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Tue, 12/09/2025 - 18:50</span>\n",

Saskatchewan is the only Canadian provider of potash, which is a group of minerals and chemicals that contains potassium. Potassium is an essential nutrient for plants and a key component in fertilizers.\n\nRoughly 95 percent of the fertilizer produced in Canada is exported and the United States is the country\u2019s largest market. It accounts for more than half of all total fertilizer exports each year, according to Fertilizer Canada.\n\nThe United States imported approximately 12.1 million tonnes of Saskatchewan potash in 2024, according to S&P Global.

One person in Blair's office who spoke with the FT said that only \"serving world leaders\" will be on the so-called board, and a smaller executive board will function under it, which will include Blair, along with Jared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law and Trump adviser Steve Witkoff.\u00a0</p>\n<a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/tblair.jpg?itok=FGV1rQdC\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/tblair.jpg?itok=FGV1rQdC\"><picture><figure role=\"group\" class=\"caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images\"><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a6e90406-1dff-4546-8499-1daaae7701c0\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/tblair.jpg?itok=FGV1rQdC\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption><em>via AFP</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>\n\n<p>Neither Witkoff nor Kushner has visited Israel in recent weeks, with most of their overseas travel geared toward negotiations with\u00a0Russia\u00a0and Ukraine.\u00a0Other elements of Trump's Gaza peace plan, like an international stabilization force, appear to have stalled.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some regional Middle Eastern leaders had pushed for Blair's involvement, including\u00a0Egyptian\u00a0President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

But, as in other things, quality and quantity are not the same.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The average news programme features a commentator who provides \u201cthe news,\u201d or at least that portion of events that the network deems worthy to be presented. In addition, it is presented from the political slant of the controllers of the network. But we are reassured that the reporting is \u201cbalanced,\u201d in a portion of the programme that features a panel of \u201cexperts.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Customarily, the panel consists of the moderator plus two pundits who share his political slant and a pundit who has an opposing slant. All are paid by the network for their contributions. The moderator will ask a question on a current issue, and an argument will ensue for a few minutes. Generally, no real conclusion is reached\u2014neither side accedes to the other. The moderator then moves on to another question.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>So, the network has aired the issues of the day, and we have received a balanced view that may inform our own opinions.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Or have we?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Shortcomings</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In actual fact, there are significant shortcomings in this type of presentation:</p>\n\n<ol><li>\n\t<p>The scope of coverage is extremely narrow. Only select facets of each issue are discussed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Generally, the discussion reveals precious little actual insight and, in fact, only the standard opposing liberal and conservative positions are discussed, implying that the viewer must choose one or the other to adopt as his own opinion.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>On a programme that is liberally-oriented, the one conservative pundit on the panel is made to look foolish by the three liberal pundits, ensuring that the liberal viewer\u2019s beliefs are reaffirmed. (The reverse is true on a conservative news programme.)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Each issue facet that is addressed is repeated many times in the course of the day, then extended for as many days, weeks, or months as the issue remains current. The \u201cmessage,\u201d therefore, is repeated virtually as often as an advert for a brand of laundry powder.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol><p>So, what is the net effect of such news reportage? Has the viewer become well-informed?</p>\n\n<p><strong>In actual fact, not at all. What he has become is well-indoctrinated.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A liberal will be inclined to regularly watch a liberal news channel, which will result in the continual reaffirmation of his liberal views. A conservative will, in turn, regularly watch a conservative news channel, which will result in the continual reaffirmation of his conservative views.</p>\n\n<p>Many viewers will agree that this is so, yet not recognise that, essentially, <strong>they are being programmed to simply absorb information.</strong> Along the way, their inclination to actually question and think for themselves is being eroded.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Alternate Possibilities</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The proof of this is that those who have been programmed, tend to react with anger when they encounter a Nigel Farage or a Ron Paul, who might well challenge them to consider a\u00a0<em>third\u00a0</em>option\u2014an interpretation beyond the narrow conservative and liberal views of events. In truth, on any issue, there exists a wide field of alternate possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, it is not uncommon for people outside the First World to have better instincts when encountering a news item. If they do not receive the BBC, Fox News, or CNN, they are likely, when learning of a political event, to think through, on their own, what the event means to them.</p>\n\n<p>As they are not pre-programmed to follow one narrow line of reasoning or another, they are open to a broad range of possibilities. Each individual, based upon his personal experience, is likely to draw a different conclusion and, thorough discourse with others, is likely to continue to update his opinion each time he receives a new viewpoint.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, it is not uncommon for those who are not \u201cplugged-in\u201d to be not only more open-minded, but more imaginative in their considerations, even when they are less educated and less \u201cinformed\u201d than those in the First World.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst those who do not receive the regular barrage that is the norm in the First World are no more intelligent than their European or American counterparts, their views are more often the result of personal objective reasoning and common sense and are often more insightful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Those in First World countries often point with pride at the advanced technology that allows them a greater volume of news than the rest of the world customarily receives.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Further, they are likely to take pride in their belief that the two opposing views that are presented indicate that they live in a \u201cfree\u201d country, where dissent is encouraged.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, what is encouraged is one of two views\u2014either the liberal view or the conservative view. Other views are discouraged.</p>\n\n<p>The liberal view espouses that a powerful liberal government is necessary to control the greed of capitalists, taxing and regulating them as much as possible to limit their ability to victimise the poorer classes.</p>\n\n<p>The conservative view espouses that a powerful conservative government is needed to control the liberals, who threaten to create chaos and moral collapse through such efforts as gay rights, legalised abortion, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What these two dogmatic concepts have in common is that a powerful government is needed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each group, therefore, seeks the increase in the power of its group of legislators to overpower the opposing group. This ensures that, regardless of whether the present government is dominated by liberals of conservatives, the one certainty will be that the government will be\u00a0<em>powerful.</em></p>\n\n<p>When seen in this light, if the television viewer were to click the remote back and forth regularly from the liberal channel to the conservative channel, he would begin to see a strong similarity between the two.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy for any viewer to question the opposition group, to consider them disingenuous\u2014the bearers of false information. It is far more difficult to question the pundits who are on our\u00a0<em>own</em>\u00a0\u201cteam,\u201d to ask ourselves if they,\u00a0<em>also</em>, are disingenuous.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially difficult when it\u2019s three to one\u2014when three commentators share our political view and all say the same thing to the odd-man-out on the panel. In such a situation, the hardest task is to\u00a0<em>question\u00a0</em>our own team, who are clearly succeeding at beating down the odd-man-out.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Evolution of Indoctrination</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In bygone eras, the kings of old would tell their minions what to believe and the minions would then either accept or reject the information received. They would rely on their own experience and reasoning powers to inform them.</p>\n\n<p>Later, a better method evolved: the use of media to indoctrinate the populace with government-generated propaganda (think: Josef Goebbels or Uncle Joe Stalin).</p>\n\n<p>Today, a far more effective method exists\u2014one that retains the repetition of the latter method but helps to eliminate the open-ended field of alternate points of view. It does so by providing a choice between \u201cView A\u201d and \u201cView B.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>In a democracy, there is always an \u201cA\u201d and a \u201cB.\u201d This illusion of choice is infinitely more effective in helping the populace to believe that they have been able to choose their leaders and their points of view.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the modern method, when voting, regardless of what choice the individual makes, he is voting for an all-powerful government. (Whether it calls itself a conservative one or a liberal one is incidental.)</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, through the modern media, when the viewer absorbs what is presented as discourse, regardless of whether he chooses View A or View B, he is endorsing an all-powerful government.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Two Solutions</strong></h2>\n\n<p>One solution to avoid being brainwashed by the dogmatic messaging of the media is to simply avoid watching the news. But this is difficult to do, as our associates and neighbours are watching it every day and will want to discuss with us what they have been taught.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The other choice is to\u00a0<em>question everything</em>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To consider that the event that is being discussed may not only be being falsely reported, but that the message being provided by the pundits may be consciously planned for our consumption.</p>\n\n<p>This is difficult to do at first but can eventually become habit. If so, the likelihood of being led down the garden path by the powers-that-be may be greatly diminished. In truth, on any issue, there exists a wide field of alternate possibilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developing your own view may, in the coming years, be vital to your well-being.</strong></p>\n\n<p>*\u00a0 *\u00a0 *</p>\n\n<p><em>In times when the mainstream narrative grows louder, the rarest and most valuable act is to think independently.\u00a0True understanding comes not from passively absorbing information, but from questioning every assumption handed to us.\u00a0If you\u2019re ready to explore what\u2019s really unfolding behind the headlines\u2014and how to protect yourself from the consequences of mass deception\u2014see Doug Casey\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://internationalman.com/help/doug-casey-economic-collapse-video/\">urgent new special dispatch</a>: \u201cThe US and the World are Heading for a Serious Crisis.\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"https://internationalman.com/help/doug-casey-economic-collapse-video/\">Click here to see it now.\u00a0</a></em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-09T21:20:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Tue, 12/09/2025 - 16:20</span>\n",

Americans don\u2019t have to rely on the press for this information \u2013 with this transparent tool, they can see for themselves what public safety threats were lurking in their neighborhoods and communities.\n\n[Emphasis added]\n\nAmong the illegal aliens in the database is 48-year-old Yehia Elham Badawi of Egypt, who has been convicted of robbery, aggravated assault, and several violent felonies. Also in the database is transgender illegal alien Nicol Alexandra Contreras-Suarez of Colombia, who was charged with stalking and raping a minor in New York.\n\nJimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez, a twice-deported illegal alien from Honduras, is similarly in the database after having been convicted of sex crimes against children. Gomez is currently facing charges of cruelty toward a child and lewd or lascivious acts with a minor.\n\nDHS has listed illegal alien Aldrin Guerrero-Munoz in the database as well after he served 32 years in prison for murdering his three-month-old son and assaulting another inmate in prison.\n\nMehran Makari Saheli, a 56-year-old Iranian national, is in the database after having been convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in Minneapolis. Saheli is also a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with ties to Hezbollah.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Email him at jbinder@breitbart.com.

    "full_content": "The Conservative Tariff Consensus Is Real\n\nThe conservative movement in America is now decisively in favor of tariffs.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed this transformation in the past. The post-war conservative movement was once dominated by self-styled free traders, as was the movement\u2019s political vehicle, the Republican Party. But opposition to tariffs is now confined to a legacy rump of the right, a small minority of conservatives and Republicans.\n\nA survey conducted by YouGov for the Economist in late October found that two-thirds of registered Republicans say tariffs should be kept at the new higher levels or raised even further. Twenty-eight percent want higher tariffs, and 38 percent are happy with current levels. Just 17 percent said tariffs should be reduced. Similarly, 68 percent of Trump voters say they favor keeping tariffs at current levels or raising them, including 31 percent who say tariffs should go higher still.\n\nSupport for President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have increased since early April\u2019s Liberation Day. Back then, 61 percent of Republicans and 66 percent of Trump voters said tariffs should go higher or be kept the same. That broke down as 43 percent saying we needed higher tariffs. Sixteen percent want lower tariffs.\n\nAnd support for higher tariffs has climbed significantly since the earliest days of the Trump administration. In the Economist poll taken between February 12 and 14, just 24 percent of Republicans said tariffs should go higher and 30 percent said they should be kept where they are. A quarter of Republicans said that tariffs should be cut. The breakdown among Trump voters was similar: 24 percent wanted higher tariffs, 34 percent wanted tariffs maintained where they were, and 23 percent wanted lower tariffs.\n\nThese surveys show that not only has support for Trump\u2019s tariffs increased and support for lower tariffs declined over the course of this year but that more Republicans and Trump voters are happy with the current level. A plurality think that Trump got tariffs just about right. Opposition to tariffs has trailed off even as tariffs have been hiked.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d event in the White House Rose Garden on April 2, 2025. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTariffs Are Now the Conservative Orthodoxy\n\nThe YouGov survey for the Economist recently asked about tariffs in a slightly different way. Instead of simply asking about whether tariffs should be raised, lowered, or kept the same, it asked Americans to assess the political position associated with the statement that tariffs should be raised on products imported from foreign countries. Sixty percent of Americans now say that support for tariff hikes is a conservative position, seven percent say it is a liberal position, 17 percent say it is neither liberal nor conservative (probably these are those same self-styled conservatives who oppose tariffs), and 15 percent say they don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting, however, is that an even greater number of people who identify as conservatives think support for raising tariffs is conservative. According to the survey, 69 percent of conservatives say it is conservative to support raising tariffs. Seventy-one percent of Trump voters agree.\n\nThis is a rare spot of agreement between conservatives and liberals. Among liberals, 68 percent say support for higher tariffs is a conservative position. Among Harris voters, 71 percent do, matching the share for Trump voters.\n\nRepublicans are slightly less likely to say that support for raising tariffs is conservative, at 59 percent. Similarly, 57 percent of moderates and 56 percent of registered independents identify tariff hiking with conservatives.\n\nWhat these numbers tell us is that support for tariffs is no longer a Trumpian deviation from conservative principles or mainstream Republican politics. The cause of tariffs is now thoroughly embedded in conservatism, and support for tariffs is a conservative principle. The Republican Party is the party of tariffs.\n\nFittingly, this is a return to an older set of principles that was long suppressed. As we wrote in July:\n\nFrom Presidents Abraham Lincoln to William McKinley to Calvin Coolidge, the Republican Party was the party of tariffs. It used them not only to protect American labor but to finance the federal government and build an industrial powerhouse. Between 1860 and 1930, the GOP won thirteen of fifteen presidential elections. The only Democratic victories \u2014 Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson \u2014 came amid Republican splits. During that era, while tariffs funded American development, the nation transformed from an agrarian economy into the world\u2019s preeminent manufacturing power.\n\nAbe Lincoln declared in 1844: \u201cGive us a protective tariff, and we will have the greatest nation on earth.\u201d For nearly all of the century that followed, Republicans and conservatives agreed. And now the party and the movement have come home, agreeing that tariffs can make America great again.",

But on this record, one cannot tell,\" Pillard wrote.\u00a0</p><p>\"Defendants provide no evidence that they based their new policy on any assessment of costs, benefits, or any other factor legitimately bearing on military necessity. Indeed, there is \u2018no evidence that [President Trump or Secretary Hegseth] consulted with uniformed military leaders\u2019 before imposing their unprecedented ban on transgender servicemembers.\"</p><p>Pillard said the administration\u2019s approach reflected \"animus from the start,\" pointing to President Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 Executive Order 14183, or <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/prioritizing-military-excellence-and-readiness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness</a>, issued in February.</p><p>In that order, Trump declared it \"the policy of the United States\" that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex conflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\" The order also claimed that openly identifying as transgender is \"not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member\" and directed Hegseth to develop policies within 60 days.</p><p>The policy on transgender service has shifted repeatedly over the past decade. Restrictions were relaxed in 2016, tightened in 2018, relaxed again in 2021 and reinstated in 2025, the court noted. The district court halted the latest version earlier this year, prompting the Pentagon\u2019s successful appeal for a stay.</p><p>The case now returns to the district court for full consideration and is expected to continue moving toward what could ultimately be a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Supreme Court review</a>.</p><p>The Department of War did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p>",

DNA consistent with Ana was also found on a blood-stained piece of rug and on \"unknown tissue\" recovered from a dumpster in Swampscott.</p><p>During cross-examination, defense attorney Larry Tipton worked to discredit the physical evidence by focusing on the limitation of forensic testing as well as the chance of contamination.</p><p>Saleem acknowledged that DNA \"could be transferred from one item to another item in a bag\" if pressed together.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/brian-walshe-pleads-guilty-misleading-police-continues-deny-murdering-wife-ana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>BRIAN WALSHE PLEADS GUILTY TO MISLEADING POLICE BUT CONTINUES TO DENY MURDERING WIFE ANA</u></strong></a></p><p>The jury also saw evidence of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/brian-walshe-told-cops-his-missing-wife-left-flight-jan-1-jetblue-records-keeper-says-otherwise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brian's actions in the days</a> immediately following Ana's New Year's Day disappearance.</p><p>Michael Roddy, a district loss prevention manager for TJX, the parent company of HomeGoods, presented surveillance video of Brian's <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shopping trips</a>.</p><p>The footage showed Brian shopping at a Norwell HomeGoods on the mornings of Jan. 2 and Jan. 4.</p><p>Receipts showed that Walshe purchased rugs, towels and bathmats, paying for the items using store value cards for $245.35 and for $155.91.

    "content": "<p>An ongoing decline in American assimilation and a deep fear of being accused of racism were key factors in the massive fraud scheme in <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minnesota</a> that is now coming to light, according to an expert.</p><p>Minnesota is facing one of the largest social-services fraud scandals in U.S. history after federal prosecutors uncovered what they describe as \"<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/schemes-stacked-upon-schemes-1b-human-services-fraud-fuels-scrutiny-of-minnesotas-somali-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">schemes stacked upon schemes</a>\" by Somali-run non-profits that siphoned hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars from child-nutrition and Medicaid housing programs.</p><p>Prosecutors have since charged more than 70 defendants, a large percentage of whom are members of Minnesota\u2019s Somali community, securing dozens of convictions as new waves of indictments continue. The scandal has triggered state and federal investigations, congressional scrutiny, and calls for accountability over why warnings were missed and how the fraud was allowed to reach this scale.</p><p>Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Border Security and Immigration Center, said that the decline in immigrant assimilation in America was key during an interview with Fox News Digital.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/inside-little-mogadishu-minnesotas-somali-community-its-push-belonging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>INSIDE \u2018LITTLE MOGADISHU\u2019: MINNESOTA\u2019S BELEAGUERED SOMALI COMMUNITY UNDER A CLOUD OF FRAUD AND TRUMP ATTACKS</strong></a></p><p>\"Assimilation is a two-sided coin. The pressure comes from inside, from you wanting to assimilate so you can make it in the new society, but it also comes from outside, where the society says, \u2018Hey, we expect you to do this. We expect you, if you want a driver's license, to be able to speak and read English at a basic level.\u2019 We don't do that anymore in America. We don't we don't really expect anything of our immigrants,\" explained Hankinson.</p><p>\"There are a lot of people who are American-born,\" he went on, \"who really don't like this country and what it stands for. And so, they don't think anyone else ought to accept it and adapt to it either.\"</p><p>Hankinson noted that in no way can the fraud scheme be blamed writ large on the Minnesota-Somali community, which is estimated to have around 80,000 people. He said that those involved in the scam are a minority. However, the fact that the tight-knit community has by and large not assimilated into the broader American society and customs meant that many of the factors that could have exposed the scheme earlier were not there, according to Hankinson.</p><p>\"When you come from a culture that provides you with nothing from the center, everything is family, everything is clan, everything is local, then it's almost impossible for you to understand how a federal system would work. And if your neighbor came to you and said, \u2018Hey, we got this cool thing going, if you just say your kid's autistic, I'll give you a thousand dollars a month.\u2019 I mean, that's a no-brainer for an awful lot of people,\" he explained.</p><p>\"Even if they thought that maybe it was wrong on some level, they might think, \u2018Well, hang on, in my new country, maybe that's frowned upon,\u2019 they're not going to rat out the clan member, the family member,\" he added.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/tim-walz-called-out-washington-post-refusing-take-responsibility-minnesota-fraud-scandal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TIM WALZ CALLED OUT BY WASHINGTON POST FOR REFUSING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MINNESOTA FRAUD SCANDAL</strong></a></p><p>That, combined with the existence of generous taxpayer-funded welfare programs and Minnesota being what Hankinson called a \"high trust state,\" made the state \"ill-equipped to handle fraud.\"</p><p>\"In Minnesota, these programs were low-hanging fruit. They were so easy to fleece, it's almost farcical,\" said Hankinson. \"So, the carrot is there to commit fraud, and there's no stick.\"</p><p>He pointed to one aspect of the scheme in which prosecutors say <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/education/autism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minnesota\u2019s Medicaid autism program</a> was exploited by companies recruiting families, securing fraudulent diagnoses, and billing for therapy that never happened, draining millions from the program.</p><p>\"That is outrageous. Somebody should have noticed at some point that, \u2018Hang on a minute, why have the autism rates in Somali kids gone from one in a hundred to like one in three or whatever it was?\u2019\" he said. \"There should have been some oversight, and there again you get into the whole <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/critical-race-theory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American racial guilt</a>, which is a particular issue that we have, where if you're an unscrupulous scammer, you can always play the race card, and that will often get you away with it because people are terrified.\"</p><p>\"Nobody likes to be called a racist. It's about one of the worst things you could be called,\" he went on. \"But I do think liberal Americans, in particular white liberal Americans, are more afraid of that label than anything else. So, some of these scammers, they threatened to make a fuss about being targeted on account of race or immigrant status or religion. And that probably contributed to state authorities being a little slower.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ilhan-omar-says-shes-frustrated-since-somalis-also-victims-feeding-our-future-scam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ILHAN OMAR SAYS SHE'S FRUSTRATED SINCE SOMALIS ARE ALSO VICTIMS IN 'FEEDING OUR FUTURE' SCAM</strong></a></p><p>This dynamic has also played out on the national level. Following the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-know-about-minnesotas-feeding-our-future-fraud-center-trumps-latest-crackdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump administration's announcement</a> of its crackdown on illegal immigrant Somalis in Minnesota, Democratic Gov. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tim Walz</a> has accused it of \"demonizing an entire group of people just by their race and their ethnicity.\"</p><p>\"I can't take Tim Walz seriously, honestly, because he was the governor who was in charge while all this was happening. Where was he?\" said Hankinson. \"He was asleep at the switch.\"</p><p>\"It's not a question of scapegoating,\" he said. \"It's a good thing to send a message, not to the Somali community per se, but to all of Minnesota and the rest of the 49 states that this is America, we have laws, we have rules. When you break those rules, you are going to get punished.\"</p><p>Hankinson added that ultimately, he hopes to see many Somalis joining in the effort to crack down on the minority involved in fraud so that they can \"give their community the reputation that it deserves.\"</p>",

How many views there are in the world, we should be able to get a variety of it.\"</p><p>Prior to her prediction, Reid talked to her hosts about how Trump has been using his office and his friendships with certain media moguls to get outlets to do his bidding.\u00a0</p><p>The commentator mentioned the example of Trump involving himself in the merger between Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s TV, film studios and streaming division.</p><p>Ahead of the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-says-hell-be-involved-review-netflix-warner-brothers-deal-2025-12-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Trump told reporters</a>, \"I\u2019ll be involved in that decision,\" remarking that such a \"deal could be a problem\" because of how much share of the film and streaming market would come under Netflix.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-reporter-says-liberals-should-actively-acknowledge-role-cancel-culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CNN REPORTER SAYS LIBERALS SHOULD 'ACTIVELY ACKNOWLEDGE' THEIR ROLE IN CANCEL CULTURE</u></strong></a></p><p>Reid mentioned that part of the reason that Trump is involved in the deal is because David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount Skydance, wanted to seek a way to buy Warner Bros. Discovery for his company.\u00a0</p><p>\"Yeah, and the Netflix president had to go have a personal conversation with Trump to get him to approve the deal because the Ellisons were also wanting to buy Warner, and they're still lobbying to try to undo that deal so they can buy it,\" she said.</p><p>Reid then stated that these types of deals will lead to a consolidation of media power under Trump and his successors\u2019 watch.</p><p>\"It's like, in the end, we're going to have like five media companies. They're going to own everything and own everything from social media to regular media.

According to the order, progress on price transparency \"stalled\" during the Biden administration, pointing out that price transparency data that was supposed to be posted was often incomplete or not even posted at all.\u00a0</p><p>\"After President Trump\u2019s landmark price transparency regulations from his first term were left to languish by the inept Joe Biden, the second Trump administration is in full gear developing the most aggressive price transparency enforcement possible,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Fox News Digital.</p><p>After the February executive directive, HHS and the Labor and Treasury departments jointly announced a package of actions to \"strengthen healthcare price transparency.\" Among those actions was a request for public input on how to better increase price transparency and updated federal guidance aimed at eliminating meaningless or redundant data while making cost information easier for people to understand and utilize.</p><p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also released independent agency guidance directing <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hospitals and health plans</a> to post \"the actual prices of items and services, not estimates.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-remain-deeply-divided-whether-replace-reform-obamacare-policies-ahead-subsidy-deadline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>REPUBLICANS DIVIDED OVER WHETHER TO SALVAGE OBAMACARE \u2014 OR REPLACE IT \u2014 AHEAD OF SUBSIDY DEADLINE</strong></a></p><p>Since these actions early in Trump's first term, the entire administration has continued to take steps to carry out the orders from Trump's February executive order on price transparency, which built on similar initiatives from his first administration. One example is updating its federally operated repository with new resources to help hospitals comply with changes to hospital price transparency requirements.</p><p>\"President Trump already signed another price transparency executive order just over a month into his second term to fine noncompliant hospitals, and additional actions to advance this presidential priority are actively under review,\" the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">White House</a> noted.\u00a0</p><p>According to the American Parents Coalition, which argued in its letter to President Trump that the financial uncertainty regarding healthcare costs \"is crippling American families,\" there is one policy prescription that could be a quick, yet monumental, win for families and parents.</p><p>In its letter to Trump, the American Parents Coalition said that a new policy directed at insurance providers, requiring them to tell patients \"exactly\" what they will cover, what they will not and transparently sharing how much patients will have to pay out-of-pocket \"could be quickly implemented to deliver another win for American families.\"</p><p>\"Parents deserve to know the price of healthcare, just like when we shop for groceries or plan activities for our kids. Hidden healthcare costs make financial planning impossible and decisions difficult,\" said American Parents Coalition Executive Director Alleigh Marr\u00e9.\u00a0</p><p>\"Given the uncertainty of pricing when going to the doctor, parents may forgo medical care or opt out of appointments for themselves or their children, putting their health at risk. Thanks to President Trump and his Make America Healthy Again agenda, he is paving the way for families to have access to prices through healthcare price transparency, but there is more work to be done and we are urging the Trump Administration to continue implementing these transparency policies that will have huge impacts on parents.\"</p><p>As part of the coalition's effort to continue pushing for greater price transparency within the healthcare system, it launched a new television advertisement that began airing Tuesday and a new website, ParentsNeedPrices.com.</p>",

She's confident, strong, such a stealth personality that being a woman isn't a problem, the guys respect her and play around with her as she is able to show she's better than any guy around. And she never shows fear or vulnerability, she's always shooting them guns and taking the risks. To the end, she's a hero.

With the Patriots on bye and Rams handling of a division rival, the pendulum at #1 is swinging slightly closer back to Los Angeles. The Bears and Eagles have slid back after last minute losses, but none fell further than the Colts after losing Indiana Jones (Note: These rankings were completed pre Rivers signing). The Texans have clawed their way back in the AFC South, earning recognition after beating the Bills/Colts/Chiefs back-to-back-to-back. Do the Panthers deserve to jump four on a bye week? Are the Vikings a one hit wonder or will they be able to stabilize until seasons' end? Who's excited for a new #32 team in the Raidahs? Discuss! [31/32 Reporting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XR1ECgiPZEo185oADs1NWqySrISSg7KguboPiSl8HWo/pubhtml?gid=167658153&amp;single=true)\n\n\\#||Team|\u0394|Record|Comment\t\t\t\t\t\t\n--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1.\t| [](/NE) | Patriots | \t--\t|\t11-2\t|\tThe Patriots had their bye this week, and for the first time in a few seasons fans were actually upset that the Pats weren't playing (yes we know we're spoiled, but that won't stop me from complaining about the misery of back to back 4-13 seasons). The bye couldn't have come at a better time, with New England in the midst of a 10 game win streak and with difficult matchups against the Bills and Ravens next up on the slate, not to mentions having just suffered a few major injuries. Hopefully the extra rest and practice will give this team the boost they need to stay hot heading towards the playoffs. This sentence would've sounded ridiculous back in Week 1, but the Patriots are playing for the 1st seed in the AFC and the bye week that accompanies it, and they should be focusing all of their efforts on securing that extra week to give them a chance for key players like Will Campbell and Milton Williams to potentially return. Looking ahead to next week, the Bills come to town in a matchup that could decide the AFC East. The chance to sweep the Bills will hopefully give the Patriots an opportunity to finally prove wrong those who assume the Pats only true power is making an easy schedule (though let's be honest, if the Pats win those people will just start saying the Bills actually just suck like the rest of the teams the Pats have faced). \n2.\t| [](/LAR) | Rams | \t--\t|\t10-3\t|\tAfter an absolute throttling of Arizona, the Rams are back as the #1 seed in the NFC. Analytics went brrr as the Rams notched season-highs in points (45) and yards (530), had 60%+ success rate on both passing and running plays, and Puka garnered the highest ever WR PFF score. Attention importantly turns to the next two weeks, where the Rams will play two crucial games vs Detroit and Seattle over a five-day span. Beating Detroit this week will clinch a playoff spot and beating Seattle next week will likely clinch the #1 seed. Or losing both could drop them down to third in the division and a 6-7 seed. Buckle up.\n3.\t| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | \t--\t|\t10-3\t|\tI am running out of things to say about this defense. They have not allowed a touchdown since before Thanksgiving. The Seahawks defense is a truly elite unit. They will keep the Seahawks in any game and are capable of winning a game on their own. Mike MacDonald you have changed our LIVES. Rookie Nick Emmanwori had a sack, a tackle for loss, a pick, and a blocked field goal on Sunday-- a feat that has only been accomplished once in NFL history when Leonard Williams did it last year for Seattle. This defense is a schoolyard bully. Similarly, I am running out of things to say about Jaxon Smith-Njigba. [He does it week after week regardless of who is lining up across from him.](https://imgur.com/a/t0rFack) Darnold woke up in the second half, but he needs to be better with turnovers. This team is capable of greatness.\n4.\t| [](/DEN) | Broncos | \t--\t|\t11-2\t|\tIts cold where I am. Colder even than the corpse of the Raiders franchise, or how cold Hell will have to be for them to get back on track. So I bundled up and watched the Broncos easily overwhelm the Raiders o-line and pick apart their secondary. I enjoyed the simple pleasures of a game under control. I felt no danger when the defense allowed 10 points in the final 5 minutes of the 4th quarter, and I'd even say I savored Pete Carroll's empty choice to kick a game-losing field goal as time expired. I never treat the Raiders as an easy win because they love to play spoiler, but I dont think they even have that much left in them. Maybe the NFL is better when the heel is a threat?....nah, let 'em rot. Next week though, this feels like a playoff preview. Let's see what we're really made of.\n5.\t| [](/GB) | Packers | \t--\t|\t9-3-1\t|\tEvery once in a while, the Packers remembers that Christian Watson is 6'4\" and ran a 4.36 40 time at the combine, and let him run a bunch of crossers where he can just outrun the guy covering him and he rips like two of them for touchdowns.Kevin Byard is very good but he can't cover that! Not when Jordan Love is throwing dimes off his back foot! With Tucker Kraft gone, Watson has become Love's go to target for big plays. 80% of his catches have been for first downs and he's had 5 touchdowns in the last four games. Can he sustain this the rest of the year and turn into the true WR1 that the Packers envisioned when they drafted him in 2022? Man it feels good to beat the Bears man  \n6.\t| [](/BUF) | Bills | \t+1\t|\t9-4\t|\tJoe Cool put forth a valiant effort but he couldn\u2019t stop the inevitable Josh Allen in the snow. With Burrow on the other sideline this game was poised to be a shoutout and it certainly lived up to the billing. Both QBs were phenomenal each accounting for 4 touchdowns, however Allen played turnover free football and that was the difference. What sets Josh Allen apart is his legs and that was on full display with 78 rushing yards and a 40 yard touchdown. The Bills defense gave up 34 points and still somehow ended up being the reason the Bills won with 2 crucial late picks. The Bills will go from facing one MVP level QB to another as they travel on the road to take on the Pats trying to keep their slim division chances alive. James Cook please stop fumbling the football!!!!\n7.\t| [](/SF) | 49ers | \t+2\t|\t9-4\t|\tThe 49ers enjoyed a bye at the perfect time, watching the Rams and Cardinals beat each other up. Unfortunately, Seattle took care of business in Atlanta, but San Fran has a week 18 matchup to help gain ground if needed. \n8.\t| [](/CHI) | Bears | \t-2\t|\t9-4\t|\tIt had been a very long time since the Bears went up to Lambeau late in the year with a real shot at this thing. While they dug themselves into too much of a hole early, they proved that they could still be in it at the end, after a heartbreak on a final play that could have gotten them in position to go ahead with little time left going for 2. It was a reminder that the Bears both have come an astounding way in just 12 months, and that they still have not put everything together yet. At the same time, if they can be cleaner and start faster offensively, and limit just one or two explosives defensively, you can see the force they could be. This is the first time in 7 years that the Bears feel like a legitimate playoff team, and if you want to go further back than that, we're talking about 15 years ago that it felt sustainable like it does now. The NFC playoff picture is so brutal this season that the Bears went from 1 to 7 seed with the loss, so a chance in the tournament is not guaranteed. They have 4 games to get their act together, particularly on defense but also to see if they can become dominant on offense, and with three of those being against NFC playoff hopefuls, this is going to be the most high leverage Bears December/Early January in an extremely long time. It's already been that way the last two weeks! Its exciting. \n9.\t| [](/HOU) | Texans | \t+3\t|\t8-5\t|\tBetween the infamous 24-0 choke, losing Tank Dell, and being sent home from the playoffs last year, Arrowhead Stadium has been a house of horrors for the Texans in recent years. That's what makes Sunday night's win against the Chiefs that much sweeter. If this offense can get it together soon, they can make noise in January.\n10.\t| [](/DET) | Lions | \t+1\t|\t8-5\t|\tThe Lions put together the most cohesive performance on both sides of the ball since probably the Washington game, handling a surging Dallas team comfortably 44\u201330. This was a heat check and as close to a must win as a game without definitive stakes could be for Detroit, and they answered the call. Jared Goff was clinical and most everyone on the offense had plus touches. Jahmyr Gibbs continues to be arguably the most electric player in football, tacking on three more TDs to bring his season total to 16 in 13 games. The Lions also brought Malik Cunningham in for what would technically be wildcat since Cunningham is now listed as a WR\u2014that was a fun wrinkle, and I hope they continue fleshing that package of plays out. The defense also got back to their winning ways, finishing the game with 2 picks, 3 forced fumbles (1 recovery), 5 sacks, and 11 PBUs. Special teams even got in on the fun, with Tom Kennedy breaking out as a plus kick returner, averaging 40 yds on 3 returns. Complimentary football across all three phases has been frustratingly rare this year for Detroit, so to see them do it against an in-form Cowboys team fighting for their lives was quite the welcome sight. Next up is a trip to LA to play the best team in the NFC and our old friend Matthew Stafford. Rams-Lions in the Dan Campbell/LAStafford era have honestly been nothing but phenomenal games, so let\u2019s hope that the Lions can rise to the occasion and give their playoff hopes a much-needed shot in the arm.\n11.\t| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | \t+2\t|\t9-4\t|\tIt is quite difficult to have a \"statement game\" when the opposing star crumples without contact in the first quarter. Jacksonville did their best anyways, dismantling what was left of the Colts to take sole possession of first place in the AFC South. Instead, the Jags will need to handle the incoming New York flyby then set their sights on a mile high masterpiece in two weeks. With some luck and perseverance, Liam Coen's squad may soon be talking about seeding rather than just making the playoffs. Tlaw and co. [believe](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47241589/jaguars-atop-afc-south-beating-colts-accept-not-going-get-respect) the Jaguars are not going to get respect. They seem fine with that notion, and intend to earn it anyways.\n12.\t| [](/LAC) | Chargers | \t+2\t|\t9-4\t|\t\u201cWhen the fates decide you\u2019re going to win, they lay opportunity at your feet. You can try to overthink or cower your way out of it, but the win will always find you.\u201d ~ Jon Bois\n13.\t| [](/PHI) | Eagles | \t-5\t|\t8-5\t|\tThere\u2019s nothing interesting to say about the 2025 Philadelphia Eagles. They run an offense that does some things well sometimes, and that\u2019s about the nicest thing you can say. They lose in dumb ways, they win in dumb ways. And they\u2019re the epitome of a team that gets in its own way. Unforced errors, like a wild throw to home plate to lose a playoff game. This game against the Chargers was both winnable and losable at the same time, like a Schr\u00f6dinger's positivity bunny. 4 picks for the Super Bowl MVP, 2 turnovers on the same play. If last year\u2019s highlight was the backwards hurdle, this year\u2019s is the double turnover play. Ultimately, this team still has a magic number of 3 to clinch the NFC East with 4 games to go, including two against Washington and one against the Raiders. \n14.\t| [](/CAR) | Panthers | \t+4\t|\t7-6\t|\tIt will not show up on the official record but I think it\u2019s safe to say the Panthers took a W this bye week. Jaycee and Moehrig are returning which boosts the defensive immensely. Robert Hunt is also getting closer to having his practice window open which will be a massive addition to the O-Line. However, the bigger story is the Saints beating the Buccaneers. After the bye week, the Panthers are tied for the top spot in the division with the Bucs. If that\u2019s not an unofficial bye win, then I don\u2019t know what is. The Panthers have the Saints in New Orleans next week and you already know we are itching to get our get back. These next four weeks are huge and the Panthers control their own destiny to potentially win the division. It is an exciting time to be a Panther fan to say the least. KEEP POUNDING!\n15.\t| [](/KC) | Chiefs | \t--\t|\t6-7\t|\tI was in a pretty bad car accident a few weeks ago. That kind of reminds me of the way the season is shaping up at this point. Being completely frank about it there's just not a lot of positives to take away from the Chiefs this year. When one of the HoFers decides to show up the other pillars of the dynasty seem to drag them back down to mediocrity. Undisciplined, sloppy, lazy, unaccountable, and gross to watch. That's the 2025 Kansas City Chiefs in a few words. The positive notes are that this is shaping up to be the first time in a decade that the team will have a real opportunity to get some blue chip players in the draft and a 3rd place schedule next year should help us right the ship.\n16.\t| [](/PIT) | Steelers | \t+4\t|\t7-6\t|\tYou know what? Let\u2019s just address the 800-pound gorilla in the room; that was a catch. Maybe the rules say it wasn\u2019t a catch, but we all know stretching the ball out is a football move. I\u2019ve watched it probably a few dozen times at this point and he [clearly catches the ball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25Uouf_9DUk) Neither here nor there. The team needed a win. Tomlin\u2019s seat has never been more lukewarm than it was prior to the Baltimore game. Everyone knows the front office won\u2019t outright fire Tomlin, especially considering he has 2-years left on his contract, but if it gets mediocre enough they could mutually part ways. But the stage was set for Baltimore to make their triumphant return to sit atop the AFC North as king of shit mountain\u2026and then they didn\u2019t. This game had everything. Pittsburgh [completed a deep ball](https://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/1pgpf91/we_completed_a_deep_ball_for_the_first_time_since/) for the first time since October. Rodgers channeled his inner Peyton Manning and\u2026[ran it in himself.](https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1pgpg5f/highlight_rodgers_keeps_it_on_the_bootleg_for_the/) We got to see a 42-year old [catch his own pass](https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1pgth7e/highlight_aaron_rodgers_prevents_a_batted_ball/) to prevent an interception. There was [controversy in the endzone.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fvntg42jpvu5g1.jpeg) I\u2019m pretty sure Rodgers and Rudolph [kissed!](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fy4b36dcdou5g1.jpeg) Speaking of kisses, Tomlin [blew a kiss](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fbzx7obbdru5g1.gif) on the way off the field that has every indication of becoming another meme. The entirety of the AFC North lost save for Pittsburgh. It was a [good day.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F6ehd8j62ou5g1.jpeg)\n17.\t| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | \t-2\t|\t7-6\t|\tPeople just don't get it. It's easy to be an armchair owner and think you know what's best for the team from the comfort of your home. It's easy to call for ~~Byron Leftwich~~ Todd Bowles to be fired year after year and say stuff like \"Replace him with Canales!\" or \"Replace him with Coen!!!\", but what the average fan won't understand is how the NFL is unpredictable and how important is to build some sort of a stability and have some sort of continuity. Especially in the case of Todd Bowles, he's been here since the B.C. era (before c-virus era) and folks just don't understand how important it is to have continuity. Yes, it's cool to rush for the next hot thing like \"Dave Canales\" or \"Liam Coen\", but they are inexperienced and you don't know what you may get with them. With Todd Bowles, you have that stability, and when you feel hopeless, angry or annoyed, you can look back and see that things eventually worked out and got better. So I know people will jump on me for saying this, but believe me, I speak from experience. Every April 1st at exactly 7 PM, I grab a l\u043e\u0430d\u0435d gun and I sh\u043e\u043et myself in my thigh. There's blood everywhere and I feel like shit. But, after a visit to the hospital, they help me and I am still alive and ready to move on with my life. And the next time I shoot myself, in the moment, I feel bad... but then I look back in the previous instances I've shot myself and how it all worked out, and I feel calm. Some people even suggested things like \"Hey, instead of shooting yourself in your thighs, have you considered going to a restaurant? Maybe go watch a movie or something?\" But... that's unpredictable. What if I end up hating the food at the restaurant or if the movie at the cinema is insanely boring? That's unpredictable. That's why I keep with the ole reliable. Alternatively.....Todd Bowles.... Folks ain't gonna keep patient with you. That stoic person...'We gotta execute better,' that was all cool, but we give that grace to inexperienced coordinators. Big dawg, you're supposed to be our Head Coach, and you're coaching like a bum... I bet you better start doing your job \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1c\n18.\t| [](/IND) | Colts | \t-7\t|\t8-5\t|\tLosing Daniel Jones to a torn Achilles would've been bad enough, but the Colts' defense was ready to give this game to the Jags even *before* that season-ending injury. Now Indy is turning to a Hail Mary attempt to save the season by [bringing ~~Uncle~~ Grandpa Philip Rivers in for a workout](https://bsky.app/profile/nflnewsreposterbot.bsky.social/post/3m7jae43oek2o), hoping to coax him out of a 5-year retirement and reset his Hall of Fame eligibility. It might sound insane, but at least that would be must-watch football \u2026 right?\n19.\t| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | \t-2\t|\t6-6-1\t|\tWell, that sucked. Apparently the team just didn't gameplan for the Sun God being on the field, and failed to adjust when he was. The managed to contain Gibbs on the ground, except in the red zone. Fortunately, Dan Campbell contained David Montgomery for them. Kickoff coverage was atrocious, Ceedee got a concussion, and Cowboys fans got their first look of the version of George Pickens the Steelers traded away. The upside is that Pickens apologized to the coaches, the coaches feel confident it was a one-off, Ryan Flournoy broke out, Ceedee appears to be progressing through the protocol, and the wheels are still falling off in Philly despite their positivity bunny, meaning a division win is still in reach.\n20.\t| [](/BAL) | Ravens | \t-1\t|\t6-7\t|\t[Bull-SHIT! Bull-SHIT! Bull-SHIT!](https://youtu.be/VFr_zlBBa_k?si=Eu-CFUruiJwSeu9d)\n21.\t| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | \t+1\t|\t6-7\t|\tAfter a dismantling of the Jets, the Dolphins are one of the hottest teams in the league right now with their four game win streak. This victory came a bit differently though as instead of it being the Devon Achane show, Jaylen Wright and Ollie Gordon got involved and looked pretty good after Achane left the game early out of precaution. With the way the other Week 14 games broke, the team's slim playoff hopes got even slimmer, as even winning out would only give them a small chance of making the playoffs. Still, they might as well try to build some positive momentum going into next season, and excerise the cold weather game demons in the process. \n22.\t| [](/CIN) | Bengals | \t-1\t|\t4-9\t|\tI need to sound angry so I\u2019m gonna do this blurb in German. Just imagine me yelling all this at a podium to a crowd of people or something\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026........Ihr dachtet, es h\u00e4tte sich etwas ge\u00e4ndert. Ihr dachtet, die Dinge k\u00f6nnten anders sein. Lasst euch das eine Lehre sein: Es sind immer noch die alten Bengals. Dieses Team ist in den grundlegendsten Aspekten des Footballs immer noch miserabel. Ja, die R\u00fcckkehr von Joe Burrow hilft zwar, aber dieses Team kriegt trotzdem nichts auf die Reihe. Die Bills haben selbst jede Menge Probleme, schaffen es aber trotzdem zu gewinnen \u2013 das genaue Gegenteil von diesem Team, das nichts anderes tut als zu verlieren. Das ist jetzt schon das vierte oder f\u00fcnfte Spiel in dieser Saison, in dem wir \u00fcber 30 Punkte erzielt haben und trotzdem verloren haben, weil die gesamte Verteidigung das Spiel damit verbracht hat, D\u00e4umchen zu drehen, anstatt irgendetwas Sinnvolles zu tun. Es passiert immer wieder, mir fehlen die Worte, ich habe das alles schon seit Wochen \u00fcber das Team gesagt. Ich wiederhole mich, es ist einfach nur Mist. Es wird nichts unternommen, um irgendetwas zu \u00e4ndern, der Trainerstab ist absolut unf\u00e4hig, dass sie das so weiterlaufen lassen. Zum Teufel mit allem.\n23.\t| [](/MIN) | Vikings | \t+3\t|\t5-8\t|\tThe 31-0 shutout was the product of wire-to-wire dominance, though maybe not in the ways you'd expect.  The Commanders ran the ball well and sustained some long drives against Flores' defense, but three turnovers (including a foolish bubble screen to Gink's side) left them scoreless.  Meanwhile, the Vikings offense was all singles and doubles, thanks to consistent (if not explosive) running and a refreshingly decisive and pinpoint-accurate JJ McCarthy.  Sure, the Commanders are struggling, but shutouts in the NFL are really hard to come by, and the 31 points here understates just how effective the Vikings' offense was -- excluding kneeldowns, the Vikings only had six drives.  They scored on five of them, including four touchdowns.  A playoff run is probably out of the cards, but if McCarthy and the squad can keep this up, you can flip the long-term script from a rudderless team scrambling for a new QB into a up-and-coming young team with a chance to maybe develop into something special.\n24.\t| [](/ATL) | Falcons | \t-1\t|\t4-9\t|\t6-6 at half. Atlanta's defense kept the Seahawks offense in check, Darnold was intercepted off a team effort, James Pearce had his 5th sack in five straight games (rookie record from 2021 Parsons). 6-6 at half. In the second half the Seahawks put up more points (31) than Falcons receivers had yards (24). Atlanta then gives up the NFL's first 100-yard play of the season in 12 seconds, followed by a fumble and followed up the fumble with an interception. Through 13 games this season, the Falcons have scored 19 points on their 16 turnovers. [Atlanta went 1-13 on 3rd down, surprisingly not the worst percentage they've had in a game this season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5pjugu/the_nfl_record_for_highest_3rd_down_conversion/) That's true consistency superseding any single player, but Raheem Morris spent his energy in the post-game press conference blaming the players for not executing his grand vision. Given the investment and hype, the 2025 season be more disappointing than Bobby Petrino. If Raheem left resignation letters in the players lockers they'd probably celebrate.\n25.\t| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | \t-1\t|\t3-10\t|\tI don\u2019t have much to say about this Cardinals team, other than you can bet on them losing lots of games and missing the playoffs every season. The Cardinals may currently be the worst team in the NFL. Unfortunately, they aren\u2019t even good at being bad, as they somehow still sit with the 8th pick in the draft after the Browns performed a tanking masterclass. I think this team can very well lose the rest of its games, and it\u2019ll still probably only end up picking around number 5. If they\u2019re not in love with a QB, it would likely be an OT at that pick, running it back with Jacoby Brissett or another tank commander, and gunning for a QB in 2027.\n26.\t| [](/NO) | Saints | \t+4\t|\t3-10\t|\tEvery single NFC South fan knew this result was coming. The Saints were the worst team in the division and the Bucs were making a playoff push. There was absolutely no way the team which should win was going to. Don't interrogate the fact the highest yardage by a Saints receiver was 40, or that neither QB threw for 150 yards. Just enjoy a classic rinky dink, upside down, multiverse of madness NFC South game.\n27.\t| [](/WAS) | Commanders |\t-2\t|\t3-10\t|\tThe Vikings were shut out last week - that's how bad the Vikings are this year. This week, the Vikings shut out the Commanders. **That's how bad the Commanders are this year**. There may not be a worse football team in the league right now. What an absolute head spinning result - from the top 4 last season, to bottom 4, if not the very bottom, in less than 12 months. You would think after a Championship game appearance, everyone should be safe for at least 2 seasons, but a result this pathetic is enough that everyone should be getting nervous and getting sweaty in their seats. The result is just historically bad; not just one of those one-off bad seasons an otherwise good team has.. this is a full-blown, unmitigated disaster. Losing 8 games in a row in the modern NFL is **hard to do**. Losing 5 of those 8 by 21+ points is almost unheard of. It's just.. so. bad.The Vikings showed up with the 31st-ranked 3rd down offense - they punted **one time** on Sunday. This week starts the first of a 4 game stretch against division opponents, as the Commanders and Giants are going to meet up and see which of the two is destined for a bottom rung spot. Following that, Washington gets the Eagles twice and Dallas once; not hard to imagine this 8 game losing streak ends up at 12.\n28.\t| [](/NYG) | Giants | \t+1\t|\t2-11\t|\tBig Blue didn't have any major accidents, Abdul Carter missed meetings or boat trips during the bye week, so Giants fans will take the small wins where they can get them. Another win is not subjecting Giants fans to watching their own team's defense on television. Thanks G-Men!\n29.\t| [](/NYJ) | Jets | \t-1\t|\t3-10\t|\tIf Steve Wilks doesn't get fired, this isn't a serious coaching staff. The Jets are 31st in weighted defensive DVOA this season. This was a top 5 unit just two seasons ago. Yes, they've traded away a couple high end players, but this level of decline is not what you should expect from a defensive minded head coach or an experienced DC.\n30.\t| [](/CLE) | Browns | \t-2\t|\t3-10\t|\tMaaaaaannnnnn. Well we got our starter. so there is that. the Browns will travel to Chicago next week to play in absolutely frigid temperatures and what is sure to be a run heavy game. so you know what better time to show off Sanders.\n31.\t| [](/TEN) | Titans | \t+1\t|\t2-11\t|\tThe Titans picked up their second win of the year on a snowy Sunday in Cleveland. Their game plan was clear: lean on the run and structure the passing attack to limit Myles Garrett\u2019s impact. Tony Pollard delivered his best performance of the season, as the offense rushed for 184 yards and allowed only one sack. The defense had an up and down day, giving up four touchdowns but forcing two turnovers and securing the victory with a pair of late stops on two-point conversion attempts.\n32.\t| [](/LV) | Raiders | \t-1\t|\t2-11\t|\tSometimes you win by losing and that's exactly what we did this week. An elite Bronco's D ate our offense alive but thankfully Pete made a great call to kick that field goal at the end (Go choke on a pizza Dave). Hope Geno recovers soon and can get back to his job of tank commander.",

      "u/MarvelsGrantMan136: Bateman:\n\n&gt;\u201dI read all the reviews. I am doing these projects for public consumption, so it matters to me what the public thinks about them. It matters to me what critics think about them. But what\u2019s most important is that the weather inside is 72 and breezy. It takes a lot of work to stay happy, to stay clear, and to be proud of yourself. You can try to drink through it, but you\u2019re sober in the morning and you got to live in those hours too.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201dI got a terrible review from The New York Times on the pilot of \u2018Ozark.\u2019 Mike Hale basically said I was so boring to watch, it reminded him of the person that he buys a ticket from in the airport. I laughed my ass off. I appreciate those that get creative with it.\u201d",
      "u/Scoob8877: Part of the point of the pilot is that he was in a fog, going through the motions. His wife was cheating on him and his partner had him mixed up in some shady stuff. He played that really well.",
      "u/Turbulent_Tale6497: I remember a story when a new iPhone was coming out.  Maybe the 11?  I don't know.  \n\nBateman was up early in the morning, and waiting in line just like everyone else at the Apple Store LA.  An Apple guy came out to get him, to let him in early, and he acted honestly surprised, he was totally fine waiting his turn.\n\nI think the dude is pretty real",
      "u/davetbison: As an actor I\u2019ve always thought of Jason Bateman as a sort of magician\u2019s magician. \n\nI know he\u2019s acting, but he\u2019s so good at it that I can\u2019t figure *how* he does it.",
      "u/AKindleSoul: Can't remember the last time I heavily disagreed with something as this take. Jason is phenomenal in everything he is in, and not to mention the insane range he has. Arrested Development and Ozark are litreally day and night in their differences and he nails both those roles perfectly.",
      "u/HoneyShaft: Last season deserves the hate though. So much build up for a thud landing.",
      "u/ActualAssistant2531: I had to stop watching Ozark because it gave me anxiety.",

    "full_content": "President Donald Trump weighed in on a decades-old border water dispute on Monday, saying he would impose a 5 percent tariff hike on Mexican imports if the country fails to swiftly deliver the water it owes from the Rio Grande.\n\nThe ultimatum is designed to help struggling U.S. farmers, especially in Texas, amid alleged treaty violations over the past five years.\n\nIn a post on social media, Trump underscored an alleged 800,000 acre-feet debt from the recently ended cycle, demanding the release of 200,000 acre-feet before Dec. 31 and additional volumes shortly after.\n\nThe president highlighted the impact on Texas agriculture, where insufficient water undermines crop yields and livestock sustainability.\n\n\u201cAs of now, Mexico is not responding, and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social on Monday. \u201cThat is why I have authorized documentation to impose a 5% Tariff on Mexico if this water isn\u2019t released, IMMEDIATELY.\u201d\n\nAs Kimberley Hayek reports for The Epoch Times, Mexico has in the past cited significant drought conditions curtailing its capacity.\n\nThe 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty regulates shared resources from the Rio Grande, Colorado, and Tijuana rivers.\n\nFor the Rio Grande segment south of Fort Quitman, Texas, the agreement states that the United States would receive one-third of flows from six Mexican tributaries\u2014Conchos, San Diego, San Rodrigo, Escondido, Salado, and Las Vacas Arroyo\u2014with a guaranteed minimum average of 350,000 acre-feet per year, or 1.75 million over each five-year cycle. The agreement allotted Mexico two-thirds of those flows, as well as allocations from U.S. tributaries, including the Pecos and Devils rivers.\n\nIn April, Trump criticized Mexico, threatening tariffs or sanctions if the country failed to adhere to the terms of the treaty.\n\n\u201cMexico has been stealing the water from Texas farmers,\u201d he posted at the time, pledging to \u201ckeep escalating consequences, including tariffs and, maybe even sanctions, until Mexico honors the Treaty, and gives Texas the water they are owed!\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum highlighted the ongoing drought but vowed to help resolve the issue. Mexico said it would draw from its reserves and increase flows from the six tributaries through October, as announced by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. IBWC data, however, showed deliveries came in at approximately 730,000 acre-feet by mid-2025, 42 percent short of the 1.75 million obligation.\n\nA history of lenient enforcement, hydrological changes, and rapid population increase in Mexico has been blamed for the current conditions.\n\nEvan Ellis, a Latin American studies professor at the U.S. Army War College, said the current situation can be attributed to \u201cyears of looking the other way\u201d by the United States.\n\nThe treaty allows for deferrals only during \u201cextraordinary drought,\u201d which is left undefined but requires repayment in the following cycle.\n\nIn March, the United States rejected Mexico\u2019s request for Colorado River water diversions to Tijuana, noting Rio Grande shortfalls. It is the first time the country has denied such a request under the treaty.\n\nThe Texas agricultural sector depends on consistent water supplies, and the allocation shortfalls have led members of Congress to introduce bills proposing fund withholdings until remedies are secured.",

Such symmetry is built into our antidiscrimination laws, which is why the laws ban discrimination based on \"race\" or \"sex\" or \"sexual orientation\" and not \"against people of color\" or \"women\" or \"people who identify as LQBTQ.\" Not surprisingly, the Court reasserted this principle in a unanimous opinion.</p>\n<p>While the case was pending, however, Wang and his students were subjected to a campaign of harassment by some of his faculty colleagues and other students. <a href=\"https://x.com/CvilleBubble/status/1998485105531318355?s=20\">You can watch a video of him recounted what transpired, and inspired the title of this blog post, here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/09/our-job-is-to-teach-the-children-not-be-the-children/\">&quot;Our Job is to Teach the Children, Not be the Children&quot;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

Originally, Alex and I were also going to coauthor this new article. But, after seeing my draft, Alex said he had little to add to it, though he very much agrees with the thesis. I am nonetheless grateful to Alex for his help in thinking through this topic, and for insights derived from his extensive expertise on it. Here is an excerpt from today's article:</p> <blockquote><p>American conservatism has been rocked by the rise of \"Groyper\" antisemitism within its ranks, roiling both official Republican Party organizations and some of the right's most influential intellectual organs&hellip;.. Even now, the debate over this issue has largely overlooked the source of antisemitism's rise in conservative circles: the political right's increasing turn towards nationalism.</p> <p>Nationalism doesn't just historically correlate with bigotry\u2014it consistently drives antisemitism and other racial and ethnic prejudices. Indeed, nationalism intensifies preexisting antisemitic impulses. To the degree that today's conservatives decide to embrace\u2014or even just make peace with\u2014nationalism and dispense with the universalist liberal principles of the American Founding, they will find it difficult to impossible to stem the spread of antisemitism in their midst&hellip;.</p> <p>In October, <em>Politico </em><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/private-chat-among-young-gop-club-members-00592146\" rel=\"\">published an explosive report</a> disclosing a selection of vile antisemitic and pro-Nazi messages from leaked group chats written by leaders of Young Republican chapters and various state GOP politicians and staffers. Later that month, Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts mired his organization in the controversy when he <a href=\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/groyper-war-consumes-heritage-foundation-tucker-carlson-nick-fuentes-ben-shapiro-kevin-roberts\" rel=\"\">publicly defended</a> prominent far-right podcaster Tucker Carlson\u2014a longtime promoter of antisemitic ideas and conspiracy theories\u2014after Carlson conducted a fawning interview promoting Nick Fuentes, an even more notorious antisemitic influencer who openly defends the Nazis&hellip;.</p> <p>The recent resurgence of right-wing antisemitism is rooted in the conservative movement's turn towards nationalism. It is no accident that it emerged at the same time as the political right\u2014led by Trump\u2014has increasingly defined American identity not in terms of universal liberal values but in terms of ethnic and racial identity. Many in the movement privilege native-born white Christians over other groups\u2014and often even privilege \"<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/10/heritage-americans-nativist-right/684472/\" rel=\"\">heritage Americans</a>,\" defined as those (primarily whites) who can trace their ancestry in the U.S. over many generations all the way back to the Civil War or earlier.</p> <p>Nationalist political movements\u2014defined here as those that hold that the main purpose of government is to advance the interests of the nation's dominant ethnic group\u2014have a long history of antisemitism and other bigotry&hellip;.</p> <p>A movement that exalts the interests of the ethnic and cultural majority and believes that these interests are the true foundation of the nation is inherently prone to viewing ethnic and religious minorities with suspicion and hostility. That may be especially true of minority groups with a large diaspora in many countries, a history that is perversely used against them as a reason to doubt their allegiance to the nations they live in.</p> <p>These prejudices are exacerbated by Jews' disproportionate success in the commercial and intellectual worlds. Nationalists tend to believe such disproportionately successful minorities are encroaching on the rightful domain of the majority group. Such suspicion is heightened by the zero-sum worldview shared by most nationalists, under which one ethnic or racial group can only gain at the expense of others. Thus, if Jews are disproportionately successful, it must be at the expense of the ethnic majority.</p> <p>Resentments are heightened by nationalists' historic predilection for conspiracy theories. If the ethnic majority has been denied its supposedly rightful position of dominance, nationalists readily assume that the cause must be some nefarious plot.</p></blockquote> <p>Later in the article, I explain how the best antidote to nationalism is embracing the universalist principles of the American Founding:</p> <blockquote><p>In his <a href=\"https://x.com/emilybrooksnews/status/1990411512255484290/photo/1\" rel=\"\">resignation statement</a> from the Heritage board, Robert George urged Heritage to be guided by the principles of the Declaration of Independence, especially the idea \"that each and every member of the human family, irrespective of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything else; &hellip; is 'created equal' and 'endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.'\" George is right. Unlike nationalist movements focused on ethnic particularism, the American Founding was based on universal liberal principles&hellip;..</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/99-01-02-11097\" rel=\"\">General Orders to the Continental Army</a>, issued on the occasion of the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783, George Washington stated that one of the reasons the United States was founded was to create \"an Asylum for the poor and oppressed of all nations and religions.\" Other leading Founding Fathers\u2014including James Madison and Thomas Jefferson\u2014<a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2021/07/04/immigration-the-american-revolution-and-the-principles-of-the-declaration-of-independence/\" rel=\"\">expressed similar sentiments</a>.</p> <p>Washington sounded a similar theme in his famous <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-06-02-0135\" rel=\"\">1790 letter to the congregation of the Rhode Island Touro Synagogue</a>, in which he avowed that the United States has \"an enlarged and liberal policy,\" under which \"All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship,\" and that the U.S. government \"gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\" America, he emphasized, went beyond \"mere toleration\" of Jews to granting them full equality. It could do so because American identity was based on universal liberal principles, not ethnic or religious particularism.</p></blockquote> <p>As noted in the article, there is also troubling anti-Semitism on the far left (which I previously wrote about <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2023/10/30/far-left-support-for-hamas-is-not-an-aberration/\">here</a>). That in no way justifies the right-wing nationalist variety (and vice versa).</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/09/my-new-unpopulist-article-on-how-nationalism-is-driving-the-growth-of-anti-semitism-on-the-right/\">My New UnPopulist Article on How Nationalism is Driving the Growth of anti-Semitism on the Right</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Anti-SLAPP statutes allow defendants who are sued based on their speech on matters of public concern to quickly challenge the sufficiency of plaintiffs' claims. They are important tools in fighting legally meritless libel suits and other attempts to restrict legally protected speech. But they only apply to claims that are indeed based on such speech, and not claims that are based on non-speech conduct.</p>\n<p>A short excerpt from yesterday's long opinion by California Court of Appeal Justice Allison Danner, joined by Justices Mary Greenwood and Daniel Bromberg, in <a href=\"https://www4.courts.ca.gov/opinions/nonpub/H052541.PDF\"><em>Khalil v. Steiner</em></a>, applies this distinction. The plaintiffs\u2014a young woman, her apparently 13-year-old sister, and their sister-in-law\u2014\"constructed a 'Free Palestine' sign out of shrubs and seaweed on a sand dune near Sand City known as 'Scribble Hill,'\" where it was visible from Highway 1 and the pedestrian path below the dune. Defendant, \"who was cycling on the path, stopped his bicycle, climbed the dune, and began dismantling the sign while engaging in a heated verbal exchange with the young women.\"</p>\n<blockquote><p>Each side accused the other of \"supporting terrorism,\" and the women began recording the encounter on a cell phone. They retreated down the dune and kicked sand on Steiner's bicycle. Steiner followed, grabbed the cell phone &hellip;\u2014allegedly also grabbing and restraining [one of the plaintiffs] in the process\u2014and threw the phone toward the street, breaking it. After Steiner departed, plaintiffs reported the incident to the police and posted an edited version of the cell phone video to their social media.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs sued Steiner asserting causes of action for negligence, assault, battery, and violations of the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act (Bane Act) (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1) and the Ralph Civil Rights Act (Ralph Act) (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.7). Steiner brought an anti-SLAPP motion to strike the complaint &hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The court concluded that the anti-SLAPP statute [Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 425.16] didn't apply here, because the claim was based on Steiner's alleged physical conduct, and not speech on matters of public interest:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Section 425.16(e)(3) defines protected activity to include \"any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest.\" Section 425.16(e)(4) defines protected activity to include \"conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" &hellip;</p>\n<p>We agree with the trial court's assessment that \"much of\" Steiner's \"speech and activity in taking down the message on the sand dune is protected under the First Amendment.\" Steiner's initial conduct during the encounter at Scribble Hill consisted of (1) engaging in a heated oral exchange with three individuals about their public display of support for the Palestinian cause during a time of heightened public awareness and debate over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and (2) physically disassembling the sticks and shrubs that made up the disputed message.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360317\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>The timing of these acts shortly after the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, the publicly accessible and highly visible location on Scribble Hill, and the subject matter of the dispute, place Steiner's oral statements and conduct dismantling plaintiffs' sign within the statutory framework for \"statement[s] &hellip; made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest.\" Further, the close nexus between Steiner's exercise of his right of free speech and the asserted issue of public interest (disagreeing and attempting to undo the \"'Free Palestine'\" message visible to passersby) fulfills the \"'in connection with' requirement.\" &hellip;] But Steiner must not only show that his conduct falls within one of the categories set out in section 425.16(e), but that each challenged \"cause of action <em>arises from</em> that protected conduct.\" &hellip;</p>\n<p>The complaint alleged that on the date in question, Steiner \"w[as] negligent in that [he] carelessly failed to exercise due care by confronting and engaging in a verbal confrontation with plaintiffs as alleged herein.\" The cause of action further \"reallege[d] and incorporate[d] by reference\" the allegations previously set forth. These allegations included that Steiner \"approached the plaintiffs and called them terrorists,\" \"accused [them] of being members or supporters of Hamas\" and of \"killing babies and be-heading children,\" \"started violently dismantling their sign and charged directly at the girls while continuing to threaten them,\" and \"accosted [the 13-year-old plaintiff], grabbed her around the neck and waist, and threw her cell phone on the bike path.\" &hellip;</p>\n<p>Construing the allegations of the complaint liberally (as we must) for purposes of evaluating the facts upon which the negligence claim is based, we read the negligence claim alleging a failure to exercise due care \"by confronting and engaging in a verbal confrontation with plaintiffs <em>as alleged herein</em>\" as based upon the full range of conduct described in the confrontation&hellip;. The declarations submitted in opposition to and in support of the motion characterize differently the nature and intensity of the words that were spoken and Steiner's physical conduct but generally reinforce our conclusion that the confrontation encompassed more than a heated exchange of words&hellip;.</p>\n<p>As our Supreme Court has explained, \"a claim may be struck only if the speech or petitioning activity <em>itself</em> is the wrong complained of, and not just evidence of liability or a step leading to some different act for which liability is asserted.\" \"A cause of action may be 'triggered by' or associated with a protected act, but it does not necessarily mean the cause of action arises from that act.\"</p>\n<p>As alleged, Steiner's expressions of disagreement with plaintiffs' message by disputing and dismantling the sign did not occur in a vacuum but unfolded concurrently with alleged unlawful conduct comprising physical aggression and oral intimidation&hellip;.. Plaintiffs might not be \"entitled to legal protection against\" a passerby engaging in offensive speech while criticizing a political protest message, but they are entitled to legal protection from allegedly threatening and intimidating conduct that escalates into a physical attack&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The court held much the same as to the claims under the Bane Act (which allows lawsuits \"against a person, 'whether or not acting under color of law,' who 'interferes by threat, intimidation, or coercion &hellip; with the exercise or enjoyment &hellip; of rights secured by the Constitution\") and the Ralph Act (which provides that \"All persons within the jurisdiction of this state have the right to be free from any violence, or intimidation by threat of violence, committed against their persons or property because of political affiliation, or on account of\" \"sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration status\"):</p>\n<blockquote><p>The alleged conduct giving rise to plaintiffs' Ralph Act claim is unambiguously the commission of \"a violent act\" against plaintiffs and their property&hellip;. Furthermore, plaintiffs have alleged that this conduct was substantially motivated by Steiner's perception of plaintiffs as being Palestinian or of Palestinian national origin, as also evidenced by [plaintiffs'] declarations that as Steiner approached and dismantled the sign, he accused them of being \"'peak Palestinian'\" and of supporting terrorism and Hamas&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Given the nature of the alleged conduct underlying the cause of action, Steiner's contention that the claim is based solely on political speech and expressive conduct is unpersuasive. Steiner has failed to show that the challenged cause of action arises from his protected conduct debating plaintiffs' ideology and attempting to erase their public protest message, as opposed to his alleged acts of physical aggression. Put differently, Steiner's expressions of political disagreement and identification of plaintiffs as Muslim or Palestinian women did not give rise to the Ralph Act claim but are arguably revelatory of his motive for attacking them&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And the court held the same as to plaintiffs' assault claim, which was based on Steiner's allegedly threatening conduct. (Steiner hadn't challenged the trial court's finding that the anti-SLAPP statute didn't apply to plaintiffs' battery claims.)</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/09/california-anti-slapp-statute-doesnt-apply-to-claim-of-politically-motivated-threatening-conduct/\">California Anti-SLAPP Statute Doesn&#039;t Apply to Claim of Politically Motivated Threatening Conduct</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>From Fifth Circuit Judge Priscilla Richman, joined by Judge Irma Ramirez, in today's <a href=\"http://So holds a Fifth Circuit panel, over a dissent. Note that part of the majority's rationale is that the photo may not have violated the statute in the first place, and that no preliminary injunction against a prosecution is therefore necessary.\"><em>Evans v. Garza</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>During a debate by lawmakers at the Texas Capitol in 2023, Michelle Evans tweeted a photograph of a transgender (biologically male) politician washing their hands in the women's restroom. Evans surrendered her cell phone to police after she learned the Travis County District Attorney, Jos\u00e9 Garza, was investigating whether her tweet violated Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.15(b)&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Evans sued, seeking a preliminary injunction against any such prosecution, but the Fifth Circuit panel said no. It concluded that the relevant provision, \u00a7 21.15(b)(2)\u2014\"A person commits an offense if, without the other person's consent and with intent to invade the privacy of the other person, the person &hellip; photographs or by videotape or other electronic means records, broadcasts, or transmits a visual image of another person in a place in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy\"\u2014wasn't likely to be unconstitutionally overbroad:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Evans argues that the statute is overbroad, but \"[t]he overbreadth doctrine is 'strong medicine' that is used 'sparingly and only as a last resort.'\"\u00a0Evans must \"demonstrate from the text of [the statute] and from actual fact that a substantial number of instances exist in which the Law cannot be applied constitutionally.\"</p>\n<p>By contrast, circumstances in which a prosecution under that subsection would likely be constitutional readily come to mind. For example, it is highly unlikely, to say the least, that there is a First Amendment right to distribute, without their consent, images of a person's genitalia or other anatomy (whether they be an adult, infant, pre-teen, teen) while utilizing bathroom facilities.</p>\n<p>It is also far from clear that there is a First Amendment right to capture and distribute an image, without their permission, of a fully clothed adult while in a public bathroom. Think of a celebrity, for example, who ducks into a women's bathroom to avoid paparazzi or overzealous fans. What if the celebrity were in the restroom simply to relieve and refresh themselves? Is there a constitutional right to follow and photograph that person in a restroom when they are seeking privacy? Is any citizen, celebrity or not, fair game for photos or videos while in a restroom? Does the fact that a person is an elected official change that equation? The law is certainly not clear that politicians may be pursued, even in a public restroom, for the purpose of obtaining and publicizing their image.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And the court also held that the law wasn't unconstitutional as applied to Evans' behavior:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360310\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Evans maintains that when the subject of the photograph is \"not in a private area of the bathroom and knows they are subject to public view,\" specifically, when they are \"fully clothed, at a sink, washing their hands,\" others in the restroom have a First Amendment right to photograph the subject, and Evans has a First Amendment right to distribute that photograph. But we cannot say it is likely that the statute, as it existed at the time of the incident, is unconstitutional as applied to Evans&hellip;.</p>\n<p>[T]he statute protects compelling government interests because \"the rights to personal seclusion, bodily integrity, and sexual privacy are substantial rights; and the state has a compelling interest in protecting those rights from highly offensive or 'intolerable' attack.\" [And t]he statute's heightened intent requirement ensures that the statute is narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling interest. A defendant only violates the statute if they act \"with intent to invade the privacy of [an]other person\" when photographing or videotaping another person, or promoting such recorded content of that other person.</p>\n<p>[A past Texas appellate decision] \"construed the intent-to-invade-privacy element\" such that \"the statutory restriction is limited to 'intolerable' invasions because it reaches only photographs and transmissions that either in the manner of their creation or their subject matter would be considered highly offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities.\" For Evans to be convicted, then, the prosecution would have to prove that she acted with this culpable mental state\u2014a high bar that will prevent conviction when no subject matter or manner of creation \"highly offensive to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities\" is involved&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Judge Andrew Oldham dissented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Michelle Evans retweeted a picture of a fully clothed man washing his hands in the women's bathroom at the Texas State Capitol. For that purported sin, Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza opened a criminal investigation and threatened to bring the awesome weight of the County's prosecutorial machinery down on Ms. Evans&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The dissent reasoned that the statute \"cannot be constitutionally applied to Evans,\" because in this case, \"the statute unconstitutionally suppresses political speech\":</p>\n<blockquote><p>The subject of the photograph was a transgender activist and candidate for public office in Texas. Both Evans and the candidate were at the Capitol to attend a debate about S.B. 14\u2014a bill designed to protect children from experimental medical procedures. In the photograph, the man is merely washing his hands at the sink, fully clothed and in full view of anyone inside the restroom.</p>\n<p>In the context of this public policy debate, the retweet of a photo depicting an activist and candidate using an opposite-sex restroom is \"speech concerning public affairs,\" which \"occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values, and is entitled to special protection.\" And as applied to Evans, \u00a7 21.15(b) criminalizes that core political speech, on the flimsy pretense of protecting privacy interests that are irrelevant where (as here) nothing remotely private is divulged in the photograph.</p>\n<p>In fact, the entirety of the incident\u2014from the activist's presence in the opposite-sex bathroom, to the picture, to Evans's retweet of it\u2014is a matter of public concern arising from a public debate about public policy in a public forum for lawmaking. Everything about it is the opposite of private. So as applied to the retweeted photograph, the statute fails to employ \"the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest.\"</p>\n<p>In response, the majority reasons that the \"statute's heightened intent requirement ensures that the statute is narrowly tailored to achieve [a] compelling interest\" in privacy. The highest authority on Texas criminal law, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, has not yet interpreted the intent requirement. So, we do not know what the intent requirement will be. And that uncertainty exacerbates the constitutional problem by chilling speech by unsure would-be speakers.</p>\n<p>But insofar as we have to guess, it should be obvious that DA Garza will not be able to prove that Evans had the \"intent to invade the privacy of the other person.\" It should be equally obvious that retweeting the image does not represent an \"intolerable invasion\" of the transgender activist's privacy. All of us use sinks in public buildings all the time\u2014in airports, restaurants, sports stadiums, and other public accommodations. In Austin, the ever-progressive capital of Texas, the sinks in some restaurants and bars are not even in the bathrooms\u2014they're in public, mixed-sex areas for all the world to see.</p>\n<p>Is there a person on earth who thinks their conduct at a public sink enjoys privacy protections? If a woman confesses to her friend at the public sink that she has a gambling problem or wore blackface in college, is that conversation somehow privacy-protected? If a man discloses that he's carrying a handgun in violation of a bar's concealed-carry prohibition while washing his hands, is that act protected? What if a woman pulls marijuana from her purse and puts it on the sink?</p>\n<p>What other privacy interest could a person have when standing fully clothed at a public sink that they do not have when standing fully clothed in other parts of the public building? Does a transgender activist have some special privacy interest in using a sink that you and I do not have? If so, what legal basis is there for affording special super-privacy protections to transgender activists?</p>\n<p>Thus, there is no way that DA Garza could prove that Evans had some specific intent to commit an intolerable invasion of anyone's privacy in retweeting a picture as part of a public policy debate. Still, an acquittal would do nothing to remedy or compensate for the significant chilling of speech Evans has suffered. Evans is therefore likely to succeed on the merits of her as-applied challenge&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And the dissent also argued that \"Evans also may have a powerful overbreadth challenge,\" and that the case should have been remanded for further factfinding about \"[whether] a substantial number of \u00a7 21.15(b)(2)'s applications [will] concern photos like the one Evans retweeted, where the person depicted is fully dressed and merely washing his hands\" or \"where the person depicted is a public figure engaged in political advocacy in the People's House.\" And the dissent closed with this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Free speech is a fragile thing. While prior generations observed despotic speech codes across an Iron Curtain, the modern free thinker needn't look so far or so far back. Take the United Kingdom today, for example. By one count, the birthplace of Bentham and Mill now arrests thirty citizens <em>a day</em> over offensive social media posts. And lest Uncle Sam look askance at John Bull, more than a few are clamoring for similar restrictions on this side of the pond, too. <em>See</em> S.B. 771, 2025 Cal. Assemb. (Cal. 2025) (providing for civil penalties \"up to $1 million\" for hosting so-called hate speech).</p>\n<p>With free speech in a tenuous balance, courts do the agora no good by playing fast and loose with Fed Courts doctrines. The least we could do is remand Evans's case for the district court to weigh the preliminary injunction factors in the first instance&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Anthony J. Nelson and Amy Stoeckl Ybarra (Travis County Attorney's Office) represent the State.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/09/no-injunction-against-prosecution-for-taking-photo-of-transgender-politician-washing-hands-in-womens-restroom/\">No Injunction Against Prosecution for Taking Photo of Transgender Politician Washing Hands in Women&#039;s Restroom</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

Undeterred by the well-deserved ridicule, the president is still pushing that preposterous premise, which implies that he has prevented 650,000 drug-related deaths by ordering attacks that so far have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/29/us/us-caribbean-pacific-boat-strikes.html\">destroyed</a> 26 vessels in 22 operations.</p>\n<p>\"Every boat that you see get blown up, we save 25,000, on average, lives, 25,000 lives,\" Trump <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-cabinet-meeting-december-2-2025/\">averred</a> during a Cabinet meeting last week. On Monday, he <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1370547505081931\">reiterated</a> that \"every single boat we shoot out, on average, we save 25,000 American lives.\"</p>\n<p>The BBC dryly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cj69x5zge95t?post=asset%3A6698c43e-1b1b-431c-87a0-1de10a8004a0#post\">notes</a> that \"the White House has not explained how it arrived at this figure.\" But it seems to be the product of several empirical and logical fallacies.</p>\n<p>First, Trump erroneously thinks the targeted boats, which would have been transporting cocaine produced mainly in Colombia, were carrying fentanyl, which generally enters the United States in small packages carried over land across the border with Mexico. \"The boats get hit, and you see that fentanyl all over the ocean,\" he claimed at a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4KUkeuuTSo\">press conference</a> in October. Trump's confusion is relevant because fentanyl accounts for most drug-related deaths in the United States. Last year, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm\">estimates</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fentanyl was implicated in more than 49,000 drug deaths, 60 percent of the total, while cocaine was detected in about 22,500 cases, around 28 percent of the time.</p>\n<p>Second, Trump imagines, contrary to more than a century of experience with drug interdiction, that traffickers do not compensate for intercepted shipments by sending more. When drugs are seized or destroyed, he seems to think, the total supply available to Americans is reduced by that amount. If that were true, it would be hard to understand why Trump <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/17/trump-erroneously-thinks-killing-suspected-smugglers-is-the-key-to-winning-the-drug-war/\">says</a> drug interdiction is \"totally ineffective.\"</p>\n<p>Third, Trump assumes that any given amount of drugs would be evenly divided into lethal doses, each of which would be consumed in one sitting by a different person. Attorney General Pam Bondi relied on the same plainly unrealistic assumption when she <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/05/02/pam-bondi-says-trumps-fentanyl-seizures-have-saved-over-250-million-lives/\">absurdly claimed</a> that the Trump administration had \"saved&hellip;258 million lives\" during its first 100 days by intercepting fentanyl shipments.</p>\n<p>Bondi's claim\u00a0<a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/05/02/pam-bondis-absurd-claim-about-fentanyl-overdoses-epitomizes-the-illogic-of-the-war-on-drugs/\">epitomized</a> the illogic of the war on drugs, and Trump implicitly contradicted it when he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4KUkeuuTSo\">described</a> drug interdiction as \"totally ineffective\"\u2014his <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/17/trump-erroneously-thinks-killing-suspected-smugglers-is-the-key-to-winning-the-drug-war/\">rationale</a> for resorting to summary execution of suspected smugglers. If the traditional approach of seizing drugs and arresting smugglers was \"totally ineffective,\" it did not save\u00a0<em>any</em> lives, let alone prevent three-quarters of the U.S. population from succumbing to fentanyl overdoses, which is what Bondi suggested would have happened but for the Trump administration's heroic interdiction efforts during its first few months.</p>\n<p>Trump's claim about the lives saved by blowing up drug boats is modest compared to Bondi's jaw-dropping assertion. But given the powerful financial incentive for delivering drugs to American consumers and the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/17/trump-erroneously-thinks-killing-suspected-smugglers-is-the-key-to-winning-the-drug-war/\">many ways</a> of doing that, there is no reason to think his lethal version of drug interdiction will be any more effective than the less violent strategy that prevailed prior to September 2. And although Bondi's hyperbole would be hard to match, Trump is still claiming, with a straight face, that he has already prevented eight times the number of U.S. drug deaths recorded in 2024 (about 82,000, per the CDC). \"I don't see a universe in which [Trump's claim] could possibly be true,\" UCLA epidemiologist Chelsea Shover <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cj69x5zge95t?post=asset%3A6698c43e-1b1b-431c-87a0-1de10a8004a0#post\">told</a> the BBC.</p>\n<p>These bogus numbers would be merely amusing if Trump were not deploying them to justify a policy of killing suspected cocaine couriers, at a distance and in cold blood, without legal authorization or any semblance of due process. Trump <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/11/trump-calls-his-drone-strike-on-an-alleged-drug-boat-self-defense-it-looks-more-like-murder/\">conflates</a> drug smuggling with violent aggression, <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/03/defending-the-summary-execution-of-suspected-drug-smugglers-trump-declares-an-armed-conflict/\">saying</a> it amounts to \"an armed attack against the United States\" that requires a lethal military response.

    "content": "<p>Justice Barrett asked several good questions yesterday at oral argument in <em>Trump v. Slaughter</em>, which deserve a further response.</p>\n<p>First, Justice Barrett asked Solicitor General D. John Sauer whether the Court should rest its holding in this case on the allegedly narrower grounds of removal as flowing from the Take Care Clause of Article II, Section III, or as being an incident of the Appointment Power, rather than holding that the Executive Power Vesting Clause confers the removal power.</p>\n<p>The Take Care Clause argument overlooks the fact that the body of the Constitution confers what it calls \"Power\" only in a limited number of places: the three Vesting Clauses; the eighteen clauses that confer limited and enumerated 'Powers' on Congress in Article I, Section 8; and a few other places. There are, to be sure, other clauses that confer power elsewhere in the Constitution without using the word \"Power,\" like the New States Admission Clause, but they are few and far between. It would be textually odd for the removal power, which is a part of \"The President's Power to Execute the Laws\"\u2014a power that the President assuredly has\u2014to be found in Article II, Section 3 as the fifth in a series of six duties that Article II, Section 3 imposes upon the President and that does not use the word \"Power.\"</p>\n<p>Under the canon of construction <em>noscitur a sociis</em>, the meaning of a clause is illuminated by the company of the clauses with which it is linked. The Take Care Clause appears in between the Clauses imposing duties on the President to (1) receive ambassadors and other public ministers and (2) to commission officers. All of this is in a paragraph that begins by imposing on the President the duty to give State of the Union addresses and the duty to recommend to Congress new laws.</p>\n<p>Imposing a duty on the President could be seen as granting the President a power, but the more plausible reading of Article II is that the Vesting Clause of Section 1 grants the President the sole but delegable power to execute the laws. Section 2 then explicates and adds content to this open-ended grant of the executive power, conferred on the President alone by Section 1, by making clear that the President is the Commander in Chief of our military and that he has the pardon power and that, with the Senate, he has the power to make treaties and appoint all officers of the United States and acting on his own to make recess appointments. Section 3 of Article II then imposes six duties on the President including the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, <strong>a duty that the President can only fulfill because Section 1 of Article II has already conferred upon him the executive power</strong><em>.</em> And Section 4 makes it clear that Presidents and Vice Presidents, unlike British Monarchs, are subject to impeachment.</p>\n<p>The Take Care Clause descends from a clause in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which was understood as taking away a power originally claimed by King James II that he could suspend or dispense with an Act of Parliament. English kings continued to remove officers long after the enactment of the Bill of Rights of 1689. The Take Care Clause's original Eighteenth Century meaning was that the President had no power to suspend or dispense with enacted statutes at will. There is nothing in the original Eighteenth Century history of the Take Care Clause that even remotely suggests that that Clause was a source of the removal power.</p>\n<p>In contrast, as I explain in my <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/25/25-332/379982/20251017170403435_No.%2025-332_Amici%20Brief.pdf\">amicus brief</a> in <em>Trump v. Slaughter</em>, with former Attorneys General Ed Meese and Michael Mukasey, Presidents Washington, Adams, and Jefferson and Congress, in the <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S2-C2-3-15-2/ALDE_00013108/\">Decision of 1789</a>, all saw the Executive Power Vesting Clause as being the source of the President's removal power. Looking for the removal power in the Take Care Clause is like looking for an elephant in a mousehole.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360290\"></span></p>\n<p>The argument that the removal power is an incident of the Appointment Power is technically correct because the President can refuse to appoint one of his own nominees who the Senate has confirmed, but beyond that the argument seems implausible given recent Supreme Court precedent. It is an implausible source of the removal power because Senate confirmation is such a huge constraint on who the President can appoint. The repeal of the Tenure of Office Act, and the concession by Congress that it had always been unconstitutional, makes clear that presidential removals cannot be conditioned on Senate consent to the removal. <em>Bowsher v. Synar</em>, 478 U.S. 714 (1986), clearly established that Congress cannot be given any role at all in removing officers. Moreover, an argument that officers not appointed by the President but who are exercising executive power are not removable at will by the President is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), which says that all exercises of executive power must be made only by officials who are removable at will by the President.</p>\n<p>To limit presidential removal power to only those officers whom the President appoints would leave vast numbers of inferior officers, who exercise executive power but who have been appointed by the Heads of Departments, unremovable by the President. This would hugely curtail presidential power over vast areas of the executive branch. It would also potentially force the President to fire a Head of Department, whom he likes, to get rid of an inferior officer who is misusing the executive power that Article II, Section 1 gives to the President alone. Again, the Decision of 1789 understanding of James Madison that the removal power is a part of the President's \"executive Power\" seems more plausible.</p>\n<p>It is the case that the Supreme Court correctly held in <em>Ex Parte Hennen</em>, 38 U.S. 230 (1839), that the officer who makes an appointment can remove the appointee at will. But it does not follow from that that a President cannot remove at will an inferior officer who was appointed by the Head of a Department but who is exercising executive power as was said in <em>Seila Law</em>. Moreover, although <em>United States v. Perkins</em>, 116 U.S. 483 (1886), held that Congress could limit the removal power of Heads of Departments as to inferior officers whom they appoint, it does not follow from that that Congress could also limit the President's removal power at will when those inferior officers are exercising executive power. Again, <em>Seila Law </em>forecloses such an argument.</p>\n<p>The case for presidential removal power under the Executive Power Vesting Clause of Article II is strengthened if one compares the Vesting Clauses of Articles I, II, and III with one another. It makes sense to compare the three Vesting Clauses with one another under the <em>noscitur a sociis</em> canon of construction that extremely similar clauses in a text should be construed according to the company they keep.</p>\n<p>The Vesting Clause of Article I confers only all legislative powers \"herein granted\" whereas the Vesting Clause of Article II confers <strong>all of the executive power in on the President alone. </strong><em>Morrison v. Olson</em>, 487 U.S 654 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). This suggests that the executive power includes some very limited inherent powers like the removal power, or the protective power recognized by <em>In re Neagle</em>, 135 U.S. 1 (1890). See also <em>United States v. Midwest Oil</em>, 236 U.S. 459 (1915) (presidential power to withdraw federal lands from public use); <em>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation</em>, 299 U.S. 304 (1936) (presidential foreign affairs power). The lesson taught by the Vesting Clause of Article I as to the Vesting Clause of Article II is that the President has more executive power than merely that which the rest of Article II \"herein grants.\"</p>\n<p>Turning to the Vesting Clause of Article III, we must note that it is <strong>the <em>only</em> grant of power to the federal courts in all of Article III. </strong>This strongly suggests that the similarly-worded Vesting Clause of Article II is a grant of power to the President, which is expanded on by Article II, Section 2; as to which duties are imposed in Article II, Section 3; and which is capped by Article II, Section 4 rendering the President and Vice President impeachable.</p>\n<p>The Vesting Clause of Article III also confers the judicial power on both the Supreme Court <strong>and the inferior federal courts. </strong>This makes the fact that the Vesting Clause of Article II confers the executive power <strong>only on the President</strong> especially stark. The lesson taught by the Vesting Clause of Article III as to the Vesting Clause of Article II is that while the Supreme Court may reverse judgments of the inferior courts, it cannot remove the judges who sit on those courts. In contrast, the Vesting Clause of Article II does give the President the power to remove any officer who is exercising executive power.</p>\n<p>It is hard to imagine, reading the three Vesting Clauses in a <em>noscitur a sociis </em>fashion, that executive branch officers inferior to the President cannot be stripped of their executive power, i.e., by firing and removal by the President.</p>\n<p>Justice Barrett also asked counsel for Slaughter how old the idea of independent agencies is, while quite rightly expressing skepticism as to the Sinking Fund being an independent agency but wondering whether the Interstate Commerce Commission had been an independent agency since the late nineteenth century. In <em>Shurtleff v. United States</em>,189 U.S. 311 (1903), the Supreme Court held that the President could remove an officer of the United States <strong>at will </strong>even if the statutory office which he held provided for removal only in cases of \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" <strong>The court upheld presidential removal power in such cases, unless the statute expressly forbade it.</strong> For officers o be independent under <em>Shurtleff</em>, a statute would have to read that the officers were removable for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, <strong>and for no other reason.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>Since the organic statute creating the Federal Trade Commission did not include this \"<strong>and for no other reason\"</strong> requirement of <em>Shurtleff</em>, the Supreme Court in <em>Humphrey's Executor v. United States</em>, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), actually misread the FTC's statute, which was enacted after the rule of <em>Shurtleff </em>had been proclaimed. The Supreme Court wrongly concluded in <em>Humphrey's Executor,</em> that Congress had created the FTC to be an independent agency in a portion of its opinion in that case, which no one ever reads, and which is inconsistent with <em>Shurtleff v. United States</em>.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court in <em>Humphrey's Executor</em> first misread the FTC organic act as creating an independent agency, and it then misread the Constitution as rendering a headless fourth branch of the government to be constitutional. Both parts of the <em>Humphrey's Executor </em>opinion are wrong. At a minimum, the Supreme Court should have read the FTC Act to be constitutional, not unconstitutional. After 1935, Congress naturally rushed in to make more and more agencies independent, but the concept of independent agencies originated in 1935\u2014146 years after the idea of presidential removal power had been liquidated as a core executive power.</p>\n<p>Every President since 1935 has tried to assert as much control as he could over the headless fourth branch of the government, as is shown in Steven G. Calabresi &amp; Christopher Yoo, The Unitary Executive: Presidential Power from Washington to Bush (2008). Franklin D. Roosevelt's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownlow_Committee\">Brownlow Committee</a> on administrative law reform called for eliminating independent agencies; President Truman endorsed an even more expansive reading of the Vesting Clause of Article II than the one argued for in <em>Trump v. Slaughter </em>in the <em>Youngstown Steel Seizure Case</em>, 343 U.S. 579 (1952); and President Eisenhower fired David Wiener from the War Claims Commission, as shown by <em>Wiener v. United States,</em> 357 U.S. 349 (1958), expressing opposition to <em>Humphrey's Executor</em>. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) were each given additional powers by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard M. Nixon, and Ronald Reagan to rein in the Headless Fourth Branch of the Government. The notion that Presidents have passively acquiesced in the stripping of their removal power over independent agencies is incorrect, as the Calabresi &amp; Yoo book proves.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court should thus overrule <em>Humphrey's Executor </em>in<em> Trump v. Slaughter</em>\u2014but simply because the existence of independent agencies violates the Executive Power Vesting Clause of Article II. This argument is compelled by the text of the Constitution no matter what the history prior to 1789 was and no matter what the early practice under the Constitution was. Judge Robert H. Bork once said that \"We are bound by the laws that dead people make, not by their unenacted opinions.\" <em>The Tempting of America</em> (1990). There is quite simply no way to square a headless fourth branch of the government with the words of the Constitution, which create only three branches of government no matter what the pre-1789 history or the post-1789 practice suggests.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/09/some-answers-to-justice-barretts-questions-in-trump-v-slaughter/\">Some Answers to Justice Barrett&#039;s Questions in &lt;i&gt;Trump v.

Arbitrator Saydah's seemingly random, uncited reference to Roblox's marketing strategy that is only tangentially related to the parties' dispute betrays the use of artificial intelligence to find \"facts.\"</p>\n<p>Similarly, the decision states that \"Just last year Sony and Microsoft partnered together to explore cloud gaming and streaming solutions using Microsoft Cloud Azure\" and that \"There is also major competition from China with their own developers and platforms, and also competition from companies in the United States, in the race to capture the Chinese market for PC Games.\" Neither of these statements were in the record or otherwise evidenced or even argued, and neither fact findings bear any citations, again demonstrating Arbitrator Saydah relied on generative AI to determine the facts of the case and make decisions on market power and competition for him.</p>\n<p>Prompted by these observations, Mr. LaPaglia's counsel's law clerk asked ChatGPT whether it believed the Roblox paragraph was written by a human or AI. ChatGPT stated that the paragraph's awkward phrasing, redundancy, incoherence, and overgeneralizations \"suggest that the passage was generated by AI rather than written by a human.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360275\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>The decision must be vacated because, by relying on AI to reach his ruling, Arbitrator Saydah exceeded his authority bound by the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement. The parties' arbitration agreement empowers \"a neutral arbitrator\" to resolve disputes between them. Dkt. No. 1-5 (Exhibit 4). The agreement also binds the arbitrator, who is responsible for supplying \"a written decision\" and a \"statement of reasons\" for their holding. Id. An arbitrator's reliance on generative AI to replace their own role, and the parties' submissions, in the litigation process betrays the parties' expectations of a well-reasoned decision rendered by a human arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Just as courts have vacated awards when the decision-making is outsourced to a person other than the arbitrator appointed, so too must a court vacate when that decision making is outsourced to an AI. <em>See Move, Inc. v. Citigroup Global Mkts.</em>, 840 F.3d 1152, 1159 (9th Cir. 2016) (vacating where \"there is simply no way to determine whether\" an unqualified \"imposter\" on the arbitration panel \"influenced other members of the panel or that the outcome of the arbitration was affected by his participation\"), citing <em>Stivers v. Pierce</em>, 71 F.3d 732, 747 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"Particularly on a small board, &hellip; it is difficult if not impossible to measure the impact that one member's views have on the process of collective deliberation. Each member contributes not only his vote but also his voice to the deliberative process.\"); <em>See also Bassett's Adm'r v. Cunningham's Adm'r</em>, 50 Va. 684, 692 (Va. 1853) (\"The authority of an arbitrator cannot be delegated to an agent&hellip; In this case the arbitrators appointed other persons to examine the accounts and vouchers in the case, and adopted their conclusions without examining the vouchers themselves. This was held sufficient ground for setting aside the award.\")</p></blockquote>\n<p>From Valve's <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.810531/gov.uscourts.casd.810531.11.1.pdf\">memorandum</a> in support of the motion to dismiss:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Petitioner contends that Arbitrator Saydah used artificial intelligence (\"AI\") to draft the award. His only purported evidence in support of this contention is that a law clerk working for his counsel claims he asked ChatGPT whether AI could have been used in writing one paragraph from Arbitrator Saydah's 27-page award. Remarkably, Petitioner's counsel [in the arbitration -EV] was recently sanctioned by an arbitrator for submitting a letter brief containing numerous citations on core issues that had been fabricated through the use of AI, including non-existent cases and cases that did not contain the quotations ascribed to them. (ECF No. 5-2 \u00b6 8.) Notably, Petitioner here cites a case\u2014<em>Bassett's Adm'r v. Cunningham's Admir</em>, 50 Va. 684 (1853)\u2014that does not contain the quote he attributes to it or stand for the proposition he claims.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The quote given in the petition as being from <em>Bassett's Adm'r </em>appears to instead be from an annotation is actually from an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Virginia_Reports/-KUDAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22The+authority+of+an+arbitrator+cannot+be+delegated+to+an+agent%22&amp;pg=PA342&amp;printsec=frontcover\">old print volume</a> reporting the case and then summarizing other caselaw on the subject. That print material is in turn reproduced in this <a href=\"https://strongsuit.com/wp/ai/cases/8509095/bassetts-admr-v-cunninghams-admr\">document</a> on the site run by Strongsuit (which calls itself \"The Most Advanced Legal AI Platform\").</p>\n<p>Because the lawyer's true superpower is to turn every question into a question about procedure\u2014and every procedural question into a question about procedure related to procedure\u2014Judge Ruth Bermudez Montenegro <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.810531/gov.uscourts.casd.810531.18.0.pdf\">dismissed</a> the case today on the grounds that it didn't involve the over $75K in controversy required for federal diversity jurisdiction. No word from the court as to the merits of the underlying dispute about who used AI and when and whether that's OK.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/09/iffy-claim-that-arbitrator-outsourced-his-adjudicative-role-to-artificial-intelligence-dismissed-for-procedural-reasons/\">Iffy Claim That Arbitrator &quot;Outsourc[ed] His Adjudicative Role to Artificial Intelligence&quot; Dismissed for Procedural Reasons</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

    "full_content": "With the Notre Dame Fighting Irish neither playing in the College Football Playoff (CFP) nor competing in a bowl game, head coach Marcus Freeman has more time on his hands, time the New York Giants would reportedly like to use to pry him away from South Bend.\n\nEven before the world learned Sunday that Notre Dame would be excluded from this year\u2019s playoff, rumors had begun to swirl that Freeman would be high on the Giants\u2019 wishlist, as that organization works to fill their head coaching vacancy. Those rumors got a boost when ESPN NFL reporter Adam Schefter confirmed that Freeman was among the G-Men\u2019s top targets.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, FS1 host Colin Cowherd asked legendary Florida and Ohio State coach Urban Meyer, who also coached briefly in the NFL, what advice he would have for him when choosing between the NFL and Notre Dame.\n\nMeyer was direct.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018You stay in college 100 percent.\u2019 You have controllables in college as a head coach. In the NFL, there\u2019s so many uncontrollables that you don\u2019t have, whether it\u2019s the GM, the owner\u2026In college, it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlus, you\u2019re gonna lose in the NFL. It\u2019s built- and I\u2019m not sure the Marcus I know. He can\u2019t take losing like I can\u2019t take losing. You\u2019re gonna win at Notre Dame,\u201d Meyer cautioned.\n\nFreeman\u2019s NFL experience is limited. He never coached in the league, but bounced around on the practice squads of the Bills, Bears, and Texans, before a diagnosis of an enlarged heart ended his NFL career.\n\nNotre Dame is not unaware that its coach, perhaps the best young coach in college football, is a favorite target of potentially several NFL teams. On Tuesday, Notre Dame Athletic Director Pete Bevacqua spoke at length on the podcast The Echoes about ensuring that Freeman would be among the highest-paid college coaches for years to come.\n\nThe Irish are certainly hoping that the promise of financial reward and the chance to avenge the CFP\u2019s snub with a national championship is enough to ease any talk of Freeman making the jump to the NFL.",

After reviewing tens of thousands of scientific papers and grant records, the authors conclude that Western public funds have repeatedly underwritten joint work between elite universities and two Chinese \"state-priority\" laboratories whose technologies drive China's domestic surveillance machinery \u2014 an apparatus that, a recent U.S. Congressional threat assessment warns, is increasingly being turned outward against critics in democratic states.</p>\n\n<p>The key Chinese collaborators profiled in the study are closely intertwined with China's security services. One of the two featured labs is led by a senior scientist from China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), the sanctioned conglomerate behind the platform used to flag and detain Uyghurs in Xinjiang; the other has hosted \"AI + public security\" exchanges with the Ministry of Public Security's Third Research Institute, the bureau responsible for technical surveillance and digital forensics.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>report's message is blunt</strong>: even as governments scramble to stop technology transfer on the hardware side, open academic science has quietly been supplying Chinese security organs with new tools to track bodies, faces and movements at scale.</p>\n\n<p>It lands just as Washington and its allies move to tighten controls on advanced chips and AI exports to China. In the Netherlands' Nexperia case, the Dutch government invoked a rarely used Cold War\u2013era emergency law this fall to take temporary control of a Chinese-owned chipmaker and block key production from being shifted to China \u2014 prompting a furious response from Beijing, and supply shocks that rippled through European automakers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"</em><strong><em>The Chinese Communist Party uses security and national security frameworks as tools for control, censorship, and suppressing dissenting views, transforming technical systems into instruments of repression</em></strong><em>,\" the report says. \"</em><strong><em>Western institutions lend credibility, knowledge, and resources to Chinese laboratories supporting the country's surveillance and defense ecosystem. Without safeguards \u2026 publicly funded research will continue to support organizations that contribute to repression in China</em></strong><em>.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">China<br />\nThis is how Chinese AI cameras see every person and vehicle at every moment <a href=\"https://t.co/s7pHvnIl9V\">pic.twitter.com/s7pHvnIl9V</a></p>\n\u2014 nikola 3 (@ronin19217435) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ronin19217435/status/1758560190624891103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2024</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><h4><strong>Cameras and Drones</strong></h4>\n\n<p>The Strategy Risks team focuses on two state-backed institutes: Zhejiang Lab, a vast AI and high-performance computing campus founded by the Zhejiang provincial government with Alibaba and Zhejiang University, and the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (SAIRI), now led by a senior CETC scientist. CETC designed the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, or IJOP \u2014 the data system that hoovered up phone records, biometric profiles and checkpoint scans to flag \"suspicious\" people in Xinjiang.</p>\n\n<p>United Nations investigators and several Western governments have concluded that IJOP and related systems supported mass surveillance, detention and forced-labor campaigns against Uyghurs that amount to crimes against humanity.</p>\n\n<p>Against that backdrop, the scale of Western collaboration is striking.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2020, Zhejiang Lab and SAIRI have published more than 11,000 papers; roughly 3,000 of those had foreign co-authors, many from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. <strong>About 20 universities are identified as core collaborators</strong>, including MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins, UC Berkeley, Oxford, University College London \u2014 and Canadian institutions such as McGill University \u2014 along with a cluster of leading European technical universities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Among the major U.S. public funders acknowledged</strong> in these joint papers are the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Department of Transportation. For North America, the warning is twofold: U.S. and Canadian universities are far more entangled with China's security-linked AI labs than most policymakers grasp \u2014 and existing \"trusted research\" frameworks, built around IP theft, are almost blind to the human-rights risk.</p>\n\n<p>In one flagship example, <strong>Zhejiang Lab collaborated with MIT</strong> on advanced optical phase-shifting \u2014 a field central to high-resolution imaging systems used in satellite surveillance, remote sensing and biometric scanning. The paper cited support from a DARPA program, meaning U.S. defense research dollars effectively underwrote joint work with a Chinese lab that partners closely with military universities and the CETC conglomerate behind Xinjiang's IJOP system.</p>\n\n<p>Carnegie Mellon projects with Zhejiang Lab focused on multi-object tracking and acknowledged funding from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Office of Naval Research. Multi-object tracking is a backbone technology for modern surveillance \u2014 allowing cameras and drones to follow multiple people or vehicles across crowds and city blocks. \"In the Chinese context,\" the report notes, such capabilities map naturally onto \"public security applications such as protest monitoring,\" even when the academic papers present them as neutral advances in computer vision.</p>\n\n<p>The report also highlights Zhejiang Lab's role as an international partner in CAMERA 2.0, a \u00a313-million U.K. initiative on motion capture, gait recognition and \"smart cities\" anchored at the University of Bath, and its leadership in BioBit, a synthetic-biology and imaging program whose advisory board includes University College London, McGill University, the University of Glasgow and other Western campuses.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, SAIRI has quietly become a hub for AI that blurs public-security, military and commercial lines.</p>\n\n<p>Established in 2018 and run since 2020 by CETC academician Lu Jun \u2014 a designer of China's KJ-2000 airborne early-warning aircraft and a veteran of command-and-control systems \u2014 SAIRI specializes in pose estimation, tracking and large-scale imaging.</p>\n\n<p>Under Lu, the institute has deepened ties with firms already sanctioned by Washington for their roles in Xinjiang surveillance. In 2024 it signed cooperation agreements with voice-recognition giant iFlytek and facial-recognition champion SenseTime, as well as CloudWalk and Intellifusion, which market \"smart city\" policing platforms.</p>\n\n<p>SAIRI also hosted an \"AI + public security\" exchange with the Ministry of Public Security's Third Research Institute \u2014 the bureau responsible for technical surveillance and digital forensics \u2014 and co-developed what Chinese media billed as the country's first AI-assisted shooting training system. That platform, nominally built for sports, was overseen by a Shanghai government commission that steers AI into defense and public-security applications, raising the prospect of its use in paramilitary or police training.</p>\n\n<p>Outside the lab, MPS officers have been charged in the United States with running online harassment and intimidation schemes targeting Chinese dissidents, and MPS-linked \"overseas police service stations\" in North America and Europe have been investigated for pressuring exiles and critics to return to China.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Radio-Canada, drawing on digital records first disclosed to Australian media in 2024 by an alleged Chinese spy, has reported new evidence suggesting t<a href=\"https://www.thebureau.news/p/our-superiors-want-to-get-rid-of\">hat a Chinese dissident who died\u00a0</a>in a mysterious kayaking accident near Vancouver was being targeted for elimination by MPS officers and agents embedded in a Chinese conglomerate that the U.S. Treasury accuses of running a money-laundering and modern-slavery empire out of Cambodia.</p>\n\n<p>The new reporting focuses on a former undercover agent for Office No. 1 of China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 the police ministry at the core of so-called \"CCP police stations\" in global and Canadian cities, and reportedly tasked with hunting dissidents abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, cases of alleged Chinese \"police station\" networks operating globally, new U.S. Congressional reports on worldwide threats from the Chinese Communist Party, and the warnings in\u00a0<em>Shared Labs, Shared Harm</em> suggest that <strong>Western universities are not only helping to build China's domestic repression apparatus with U.S. taxpayer funds, but may also be contributing to global surveillance tools that can be paired with Beijing's operatives abroad</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>To counter this trend, the </em><strong><em>paper urges a reset in research governance</em></strong><em>: broaden due diligence to weigh human-rights risk, mandate transparency over all international co-authorships and joint labs, condition partnerships with security-linked institutions on strict safeguards and narrow scopes of work, and strengthen university ethics bodies so they take responsibility for cross-border collaborations.</em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T03:35:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Tue, 12/09/2025 - 22:35</span>\n",

Times,</em></a></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What will it take to get crime under control in our subways and public transit systems?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Dec. 1, news broke of another passenger set on fire in New York City\u2019s subway\u2014although this story wasn\u2019t all it seemed.</p>\n\n<p>The homeless man who at first said he was the victim of an attack turned tight-lipped when police pressed him about what happened.</p>\n\n<p>Had he set his own clothes ablaze to attract attention?</p>\n\n<p><strong>In the wild environment our subways have become, a malicious attack or a madman\u2019s self-inflicted injury are both all too believable.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Most trips on the New York City subway or Washington\u2019s Metro system don\u2019t resemble a clip from \u201cMad Max,\u201d but sooner or later anyone who rides the rails of our cities regularly encounters insanity, aggression, and the prospect of violence\u2014or actual violence, including the murderous kind.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The life-changing and very nearly life-ending attack on Bethany MaGee, the woman set aflame on a Chicago Blue Line train last month, was no hoax.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Nor was the assault that killed Iryna Zarutska on a commuter train in Charlotte, North Carolina, this summer.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Nor was the burning alive of Debrina Kawam on the New York City subway in December 2024.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>None of those women had any reason to fear for her life, yet a commute turned into unspeakable terror.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a

/></picture></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>And it was predictable\u2014not because these victims had anything special to fear but because everyone knows what\u2019s allowed to happen in the tunnels and on the trains.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If a thug with 72 arrests to his name\u2014such as the man who tried to immolate the 26-year-old MaGee in Chicago\u2014or with \u201cjust\u201d 14 arrests\u2014such as Zarutska\u2019s murderer\u2014decides that this is the day to take an unsuspecting victim, what chance does the victim have?</p>\n\n<p>Her fate was already decided by judges who chose to not lock up men who were a demonstrated threat to the public.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The killers and would-be killers are only half the problem.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The other half are the judges and lawmakers who put them on the streets in the first place,</strong> leaving them free to ambush unsuspecting victims on train cars, where they can\u2019t escape.</p>\n\n<p><em>(MaGee did try running, but her attacker caught up and torched her.)</em></p>\n\n<p>Legislators in North Carolina, at least, are trying to stop this murderous chain of events before it begins, by putting men with criminal records like those of Zarutska\u2019s killer in prison or mental institutions as soon as they start breaking the law.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cIryna\u2019s Law\u201d restricts cashless bail, requires judges to order more mental evaluations, and makes it easier to involuntarily commit offenders found to be disturbed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It also attempts to restore the death penalty in North Carolina, which has been blocked for nearly 20 years by legal challenges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The law is a good start, </strong>and other states need similar reforms to incarcerate and institutionalize more of the people who commit horrors such as the subway attacks of recent months.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a federal role in this, too, including rigorous enforcement of immigration law.</p>\n\n<p>Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, the man charged with burning Kawam to death, is an illegal immigrant who should never have been in this country to begin with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yet more is needed: not only zero tolerance toward violent and repeat offenders, but also zero tolerance in the political process for judges who go easy on them.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some states elect judges, and voters in those places can make known just how they feel about judges\u2019 culpability for crimes committed by the lawbreakers they set loose.</p>\n\n<p>And states have provisions for impeaching judges, just as the federal government does.</p>\n\n<p>Where judges egregiously endanger the public with their leniency toward criminals, they should be impeached and removed from office.</p>\n\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t take many examples before soft-on-crime judges got the message.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Of course, judges themselves, where they aren\u2019t elected by the public, are appointed by politicians who have to answer to voters\u2014and those pols should feel the heat, too.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Five years ago, progressives were pushing, in all seriousness, to \u201cdefund the police\u201d and \u201cabolish bail,\u201d meaning, in the latter instance, simply releasing a wider array of arrestees.</p>\n\n<p>In most of the country, those slogans were not political winners, but advocates for these policies count more on elite sympathy, especially within the legal profession, than they do on ballot-box victories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Their gamble is that most Americans pay no mind to the inner workings of state courts and legislatures, so what loses in an election can still win where laws and legal precedents are actually made.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This populist moment in national politics arises from the distrust our leaders have engendered among the public.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But leaders in states and cities have betrayed Americans\u2019 trust, too, and their betrayal turns public transportation into scenes of public execution for innocents such as Zarutska.</strong></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a

The sales include the former archdiocesan headquarters on First Avenue in Manhattan.</p>\n\n<p>Dolan also said the compensation efforts were being complicated by ongoing legal struggles with Chubb Insurance Companies, which \u200chas refused to pay claims for policies that included \u201ccoverage for sexual misconduct claims, for itself and the parishes, schools, and archdiocesan charitable organizations.\u201d The church said it had purchased such general liability insurance coverage for \u200cthe decades coinciding with the allegations of abuse.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Despite accepting millions in premiums from the archdiocese, Chubb has steadfastly refused to honor the policies it issued</strong>,\u201d the cardinal said.</p>\n\n<p>Chubb accused the \u200barchdiocese of tolerating and covering up child sexual abuse for decades and called for more transparency, saying the archdiocese has refused to share \u201cwhat they knew and when.\u201d</p>\n<a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28448%29_0.jpg?itok=WSRxulEk\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28448%29_0.jpg?itok=WSRxulEk\"><picture><figure role=\"group\" class=\"caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images\"><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"bd5e8d54-2a6c-499e-b737-0ac32b51a359\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_80%28448%29_0.jpg?itok=WSRxulEk\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption><em>St. Patrick's Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, in New York City, on Sept. 8, 2015.

That parish\u2014Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish in Scarsdale\u2014is facing imminent court proceedings related to \u201calleged abuse by a former lay employee at the parish,\u201d the cardinal said.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the lawsuits against the archdiocese were filed after New York\u2019s Child Victims Act was enacted in 2019. It extended the statute of limitations for civil lawsuits involving child sexual abuse, creating a one-year retrospective window that allowed petitioners to file historical claims of clergy abuse.</p>\n\n<p>Before this, under the archdiocese\u2019s voluntary compensation effort established by Dolan to compensate victims abused by priests or deacons of the archdiocese, 189 victim-survivors were recognised by the church and compensated more than $40 million.</p>\n\n<p>Attorney Jeff Anderson, who represents some 300 of the 1,311 accusers whose claims date from 1952 to 2020, said that the archdiocese agreed to negotiate settlements over \u2060the next two months.

Law enforcement was immediately notified and handled the case.

According to Rahim, new drilling projects and slowing demand growth would weigh further on already depressed crude prices next year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cWhether it\u2019s a glut, or a super glut, it\u2019s hard to get away from that,\u201d </strong>Rahim said in remarks alongside the company\u2019s annual results.</p>\n\n<p>Brent crude has fallen 16% this year, on track for its worst year since 2020. Prices are expected to be further damped by major projects coming online next year, including in Brazil and Guyana.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The glut thesis is hardly new, and has been popularized by banks such as Citi and Goldman for the past year. As Goldman analyst Daan Struyven wrote in his latest oil tracker note, <em>\"global visible oil stocks have built by nearly 2mb/d over the past 30 days.\" </em>The banks expects them to grow significantly more in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/total%20oil%20stocks.jpg?itok=aGhUuKrf\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/total%20oil%20stocks.jpg?itok=aGhUuKrf\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"dae77b46-0228-4d2f-a742-638d8c7b13e3\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"548\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/total%20oil%20stocks.jpg?itok=aGhUuKrf\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile demand from China, which is widely seen as aggressively stocking its <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-accelerates-oil-reserve-site-build-amid-stockpiling-drive-2025-10-07/\">strategic petroleum reserve by 500kb/d </a>(and as much as 1 mm/d according to some estimates) and is the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, is expected to grow more slowly next year due to its huge fleet of electric vehicles, which have sharply reduced petrol demand. Low prices this year have prompted China to buy more crude to fill its strategic stockpile.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cChina needs to keep buying at this rate, for that super glut to not show up even earlier,\u201d </strong>Rahim added.</p>\n\n<p>The US government has also been trying to keep oil prices low, and President Donald Trump has pledged to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d in a push to increase American production. There has also been speculation that the US will also refill its SPR which was largely emptied by Biden but since that will promptly drive prices higher, so far this has been nothing but speculation, and meanwhile the US barely has any reserves for a true emergency.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Ben Luckock, head of oil trading at Trafigura, said in October that he expected oil prices could fall below $60 a barrel before rallying. \u201cI suspect we\u2019ll go into the $50s at some point across Christmas and the new year,\u201d he said at the time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37a7bc5c-3d16-4f00-be12-9e039b9bfea1\">According to the FT,\u00a0 </a>Trafigura reported net profits of $2.7bn during the fiscal year that ended in September, down slightly from $2.8bn the previous year, and a five-year low after years of bumper profits linked to Russia\u2019s full invasion of Ukraine when most commodity traders were breaching sanctions and making a killing in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Its non-ferrous metals trading division reported a record year, due in part to the profits made by shipping copper into the US amid the disruptions caused by whipsawing tariff rules, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Trafigura CEO Richard Holtum said \u201csignificant headline-driven volatility\u201d had been a major driver for markets this year and that the trend would continue in 2026.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTrading conditions were not easy last year and our trading team put on a really credible performance across all divisions,\u201d said Holtum.</p>\n\n<p>However, the small drop in profits, combined with rising payouts to Trafigura\u2019s employee-shareholders, meant group equity fell slightly, to $16.2bn, from $16.3bn the previous year, marking the first time this figure has shrunk since 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Payouts to Trafigura\u2019s employees rose to $2.9bn, up from $2bn during the prior year.

AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>\n\n<p>There is broad public support for Trump\u2019s efforts to seal the southern border and reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering the country\u2014from <a href=\"https://budget.house.gov/imo/media/doc/ogr_icymi.pdf\">approximately</a> 3 million annually under President Joe Biden to near zero today. Understandably, urban crime and illegal immigration are closely linked in the public\u2019s mind. While the public supports the administration\u2019s primary goals\u2014to sharply reduce crime and completely end unlawful entry\u2014the president is sometimes perceived as heavy-handed. A more refined approach could help secure the support these policies warrant.</p>\n\n<p>The deployment of National Guard troops in Washington has been notably effective. <strong>Even the strongly partisan Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, thanked the president for their presence</strong>. Violent crime has declined by more than 50 percent, and petty crimes have dropped 40 to 50 percent. At the same time, the administration has begun <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/federal-government-will-take-over-dcs-union-station-5906794\">restoring Union Station</a>\u2014a historic structure long plagued by vagrancy and drug use\u2014<a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/kennedy-center-honors-raises-record-breaking-23-million-grenell-5955094\">revamping the Kennedy Center,</a> and adding a grand <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/white-house-ballroom-project-breaks-ground-5932501\">ballroom to the White House</a>, all reportedly without taxpayer cost. The president\u2019s commitment to restoring Washington as a city of grandeur and civic pride is widely supported, both by Washingtonians and the public at large.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, some Democratic leaders in cities such as Chicago have accused the federal government of an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563882/illinois-and-chicago-sue-the-trump-administration-over-national-guard-deployment\">occupation</a>,\u201d suggesting it has no jurisdiction, despite Chicago being part of the United States. Such objections come as Metropolitan Chicago\u2019s gun-related crime rate is reportedly 10 times that of similarly sized Toronto. <strong>Greater law-enforcement presence is clearly needed.</strong> However, the National Guard is a costly option, especially when guardsmen are deployed from out of state. For instance, guardsmen in Washington are from West Virginia, as Democratic governors of neighboring states declined to assist. Their deployment over four months has cost more than $200 million.</p>\n\n<p>The National Guard has also been <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/additional-2000-national-guard-now-deployed-in-los-angeles-pentagon-says-5874792\">deployed to Los Angeles</a> and other cities to contain riots opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Border Czar Tom Homan has stated that 74 percent of deportees have violent histories and pose a threat to public safety.<strong> President Trump has emphasized that ICE targets \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d While these claims may be accurate, they\u2019re not universally accepted and would benefit from clear substantiation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Critics\u2014including many in the national political media\u2014allege that the administration is targeting law-abiding, family-oriented individuals who entered illegally years ago and have since become productive residents, while some dangerous individuals escape detection. Even if the administration\u2019s numbers are correct, that still suggests that 24 percent of deportees, according to Homan, aren\u2019t dangerous. These individuals often become the focus of sympathetic features in outlets such as The New York Times. As with tariffs and other complex policies, the administration would benefit from refining its enforcement strategy to transform it into a broadly accepted success.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Given the sharp increase in attacks on ICE agents, it\u2019s reasonable for agents to wear masks and body armour and to move discreetly when detaining suspects</strong>. The president\u2019s strong defence of ICE appears justified, provided enforcement efforts truly focus on serious offenders rather than longtime residents who have otherwise complied with the law.</p>\n\n<p>The administration might consider a version of President Bill Clinton\u2019s initiative to fund <a href=\"https://clintonwhitehouse3.archives.gov/WH/Work/052998.html\">100,000 additional police officers</a>\u2014provided they\u2019re deployed to high-crime areas rather than low-risk districts or desk roles. A balanced combination of National Guard support and increased local policing might be effective if Democratic mayors, often resistant, can be persuaded to cooperate. If not, federal authorities may need to persist with guard deployments, but should require local governments to share the financial burden.</p>\n\n<p>Less than a year into his presidency, President Trump is fulfilling his campaign promises and has broad public backing. It would be a political setback if minor adjustments in policy execution prevent his administration from securing unambiguous public support.<strong> He should take steps to prevent inflammatory comparisons</strong>\u2014such as those likening of his administration\u2019s approach to that of Nazi Germany\u2019s\u2014from gaining traction. Politicians making such remarks should be held accountable not only for the deterioration of major cities but also for perpetuating inflammatory rhetoric.</p>\n\n<p><em>Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times or ZeroHedge.</em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T01:05:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Tue, 12/09/2025 - 20:05</span>\n",

Our representation should reflect that, sadly enough, it doesn't,\" she continued. \"After evaluating the data, analyzing the trends, researching historic numbers, and combing over the crosstabs, it was clear, the numbers were strongest for my candidacy for United States Senate, that's why I decided to enter this race.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-house-democrat-drops-out-texas-senate-race-jasmine-crockett-candidacy-rumors-swirl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>EX-NFL STAR ABANDONS SENATE BID AS JASMINE CROCKETT NEARS MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT</u></strong></a></p><p>Crockett's campaign announcement, which included a video with soundbites of Trump attacking her, came shortly after former Rep.

Lawmakers on the panel are responsible for setting terms of debate on a bill, including deciding which amendments, if any, can be voted on.</p><p>The next step is generally a House-wide procedural vote, called a rule vote, where lawmakers decide whether to green-light debating the bill.\u00a0</p><p>Fox News Digital was told earlier this week that House GOP leaders hope to hold the NDAA vote in the early evening Wednesday.</p><p>But questions about whether the bill could pass a chamber-wide rule vote earlier in the day began popping up soon after the 3,000-page bill was unveiled Sunday night.</p><p>Rule votes generally fall along party lines even if the underlying measure has bipartisan support. And with a razor-thin majority, Speaker <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Johnson</a>, R-La., can only afford to lose two GOP votes and still win.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/germany-unveils-new-incentives-boost-military-recruitment-amid-growing-russia-threat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>GERMANY UNVEILS NEW INCENTIVES TO BOOST MILITARY RECRUITMENT AMID GROWING RUSSIA THREAT</u></strong></a></p><p>At least two House Republicans, Eric Burlison, R-Mo., and Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital Tuesday afternoon they are undecided on the House-wide rule vote.</p><p>Some conservatives are concerned with the bill's exclusion of a ban on central bank digital currency (CBDC). Without it, GOP privacy hawks argue that the federal government could use <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-make-us-crypto-capital-planet-signs-genius-act-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital currency</a> for widespread surveillance and control of Americans.</p><p>\"Conservatives were promised that an anti-central bank digital currency language, authored by Tom Emmer, the whip, would be in the NDAA. Our initial reading of it, we've had it for hours now, is that it is not in there. And then there is no anti-abortion language either. So, as we fund our military, there are red lines that we need to put in here,\" Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, said on \"Mornings with Maria\" Monday.</p><p>Self told Fox News Digital he was also undecided on the rule vote but would vote \"no\" on the final legislation.</p><p>Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, posted his frustration with the measure's exclusion on X and told reporters he too was undecided on the rule.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., said he was frustrated with the process of crafting the final NDAA.</p><p>\"All of this was negotiated behind closed doors,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"We're getting shoved, and we just have to eat it, or, you know, vote against increasing pay to our military service members. It's a very unfortunate situation to be in, that the speaker keeps putting us in.\"</p><p>And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said he was likely going to vote \"no\" on the rule vote Wednesday.</p><p>It was a good sign, however, that the House Rules Committee's three House Freedom Caucus members \u2014 Reps. Morgan Griffith, R-Va.; Chip Roy, R-Texas; and Ralph Norman, R-S.C. \u2014 all voted to advance it to a chamber-wide vote.</p><p>The vast majority of House Republicans are also supportive of the legislation, pointing out it includes multiple measures codifying Trump's agenda, ramping up the U.S.'s capabilities against China and other adversaries, as well as providing a pay increase for service members.</p><p>House GOP leaders have the option of putting the bill up under suspension of the rules, meaning it bypasses that procedural hurdle in exchange for raising the passage threshold to two-thirds rather than a simple majority.</p><p>The NDAA itself is likely to pass along bipartisan lines, but it's unclear how many <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/democrats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Democrats will</a> help.\u00a0</p><p>Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he would vote for the NDAA despite concerns \"with how a number of issues were handled by the Speaker and the White House during final negotiations,\" he said in a statement.</p>",

The Michigan Department of Education told OutKick that it \"received the complaint and is reviewing it.\"</p><p>The complaint stated that the students were not aware that they would be sharing a locker room with a transgender athlete.</p><p>According to the complaint, \"The presence of a male in the girls\u2019 locker room was not disclosed prior to the match, constituting a violation of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/personal-freedoms/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">privacy</a> and bodily integrity protections under Title IX.\"</p><p>The Department of Education is investigating several schools across the country for Title IX violations related to transgender athletes but none of those investigations involve schools in Michigan. Lechner filed the complaint with hopes to change that.</p><p>Lechner's remarks during the press conference called out Ann Arbor Skyline High School for rostering a biological male athlete on the girls' high school volleyball team, \"placing female athletes in danger and subjecting them to a loss of privacy, safety, and dignity.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/california-high-schools-odds-after-alleged-trans-athlete-displaces-female-cross-country-top-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS AT ODDS AFTER ALLEGED TRANS ATHLETE DISPLACES FEMALE IN CROSS-COUNTRY TOP 10</strong></a></p><p>The Skyline girls volleyball team had the trans athlete in its starting lineup and ended up reaching the Michigan Division 1 state quarterfinals.

The waiver was granted in compliance with applicable state and federal law. The MHSAA is obligated to follow both, even as state law and federal guidance have evolved in recent years, often in competing ways,\" an MHSAA spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p><p>Laura Perry, a candidate running for Michigan's 31st State House District, said that the waiver process \"must be eliminated because it directly conflicts with federal law.\"</p><p>Perry told reporters that they are calling on the U.S. Department of Education and the Trump administration to \"act swiftly in this manner.\"</p><p>\"Women's sports must be separated by biological sex.

The MHSAA has consistently emphasized that it must follow the law, and when conflicts in law arise, the MHSAA must rely upon the legislature or the courts to provide clarity,\" the MHSAA spokesperson told Fox News Digital.</p><p>The Department of Education, Michigan Department of Education, and Monroe Public Schools did not immediately respond to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox News Digital</a>'s request for comment.</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>FIRST ON FOX:</strong> Although the federal government\u2019s spending on citizens has never been greater, Americans continue to feel the burden of an <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-insists-prices-coming-down-blames-biden-voters-say-theyre-still-getting-squeezed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affordability crisis</a>.</p><p>Conservative fiscal watchdog group Open The Books, which keeps track of various metrics on government growth and spending, identified in their latest report that, since 1916, per capita government spending, or how much money the government spends on average per person in the United States, is 9,800% bigger.\u00a0</p><p>In 1916, the government spent an average of $208.36 per person in today's dollars, according to Open The Books. Since then, the fiscal watchdog group says the trend line has gone up \"almost uninterrupted\" and the current per capita spending by the federal government sits at $20,474.19.</p><p>Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government agency that provides economic and budgetary analyses, found that in Fiscal Year 2025 the federal government spent a record $7.035 trillion.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-turns-up-heat-bidens-economic-record-voters-sour-affordability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>WHITE HOUSE TURNS UP HEAT ON BIDEN\u2019S ECONOMIC RECORD AS VOTERS SOUR ON \u2018AFFORDABILITY\u2019</strong></a>\u00a0</p><p>\"While American families and businesses find a way to do more with less, government does less with more,\" Open The Books CEO John Hart told Fox News Digital. \"Today's federal government is 98 times bigger per person than it was just over a century ago. The best affordability and stimulus program imaginable is to reduce the waste, fraud and central planning in government. Every dollar saved in Washington is a dream realized somewhere in America.\"</p><p>The government's per capita spending level equals about $82,000 for a family of four. In their report outlining their findings, the group pointed out that this is virtually just as much as the median household income in 2024, which was $83,730.</p><p>Open The Books also notes that, according to national averages for how much people spend annually on their mortgages and groceries, the government's per capita spending eclipses the average spending on these two basic needs. According to Open The Books, the Department of Agriculture recommends spending between $12,000 and $20,000 annually on groceries for a family of four, while the average mortgage payment in 2025 is just under $28,000, according to <a href=\"https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/average-mortgage-payment#:~:text=Average%20monthly%20mortgage%20payment%20in,term%20than%20a%20shorter%20one.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Rocket Mortgage</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americans-have-never-had-access-more-luxuries-why-do-we-feel-so-poor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>AMERICANS HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO MORE LUXURIES, BUT WHY DO WE FEEL SO POOR?</strong></a>\u00a0</p><p>During the early part of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump's</a> first term, as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) began to take shape, Open The Books also worked to keep track of all the savings that the Musk-led group created. Ultimately, DOGE's cuts were but a drop in the bucket compared to how much the government forks over each year in mandatory spending for programs like Medicare and Social Security, Open The Books found.\u00a0</p><p>While DOGE helped scoop up discretionary spending savings totaling approximately $150 billion, and congressional Republicans' passed a July rescission package saving around $9 billion, spending for Medicare in 2024 totaled around $912 billion, while Social Security got $1.5 trillion. \u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, another recent report from Open The Books illustrated how government spending has increased at a much faster rate than it has grown. For example, staffing levels at the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/dept-of-education\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>Department of Education</u></a> have decreased since 2000, but the agency's spending has grown by 749%, according to Open The Books.</p><p>\"Much of the spending growth is now predestined as Americans are forced to service an extraordinary national debt. But taxpayers should also scrutinize all aspects of federal spending,\" Open The Books wrote in their per-capita spending report.\u00a0</p><p>\"Has quality of life, affordability, or innovation improved along with per capita spending? Aside from interest, what else is the government buying that it wasn\u2019t before, back when we were building ourselves into a global superpower? Open the Books will spend 2026 continuing to expose waste, fraud and abuse wherever it exists and pushing for real-time transparency for taxpayers. Put simply, they deserve more bang for their buck.\"</p>",

    "timestamp": 1765318683.0,
    "content": "It is common (and correct) to take dominant QBs and adjust them for their supporting cast to separate them from the true elite QBs in the league. For example Purdy (1st in all 3 stats), Goff (5th, 5th, and 16th), Love (2nd, 11th, and 4th), Stafford (9th, 10th, 14th) have had their great to elite output put into context with the supporting casts they've had during their playing time. Therefore, they accurately sit soundly in the 5-10 range of QBs, if not just outside, despite the numbers they put up.\n\nHurts is often added to this group due to the success of the team around him (and other factors like his rushing TD numbers especially with the TD push, and his fantasy dominance), and is said to be given the \"same treatment\" of being placed in this 5-10 tier as opposed to higher because people acknowledge his stacked supporting cast.\n\nBut in reality, his performance and contribution to the team hasn't even been close to that 5-10 tier of passing offenses/overall offenses. And that is without accounting for the amazing situation he is playing in. He has routine issues with accuracy and passing under pressure that the top QBs handle much better. His weapons routinely underperform compared to their talent.\n\nIn light of another miserable performance last night, Hurts' standing among other QBs really needs to be evaluated. He does not belong in the tier with Stafford/Purdy/Goff/Love or Dak/Herbert (who performs at/above Hurts' level with less help), or maybe (TBD) young/newly good guys if they continue this performance like Maye/Darnold/Mayfield/Jayden (hard to rank him). He fits much more reasonably in a tier with TLaw/Tua/Stroud/Kyler, average QBs, maybe a little below, but above the Dalton line, and would take a while before the team decided to move on from them. If you put great teams around them, they can have great stretches and play good overall. But they're not the caliber of QB you'd want to build your entire team around, and if you have the chance to \"Jordan Love\" or \"Jalen Hurts\" your existing QB if a player falls to you, you should.",

    "full_content": "On Tuesday Evening, President Donald Trump traveled to Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, to deliver remarks on the economy.\n\nPresident Trump began his remarks by wishing the crowd a Merry Christmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n.@POTUS in PA: \"I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible Commonwealth, with so many proud, hardworking American patriots... Let me begin by wishing each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas!\" \ud83c\udf84\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/cfUwmgUmzI \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nHe touted the notable decrease in gas prices since he took office.\n\n.@POTUS: \"We're right now drilling more oil than we've ever done \u2014 ever before... It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon.\" \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/ltvNEbYkwo \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nHe also emphasized the progress on wages:\n\n.@POTUS: \"Under Biden, real wages plummeted by $3,000 a year. Under Trump, the typical factory worker has seen their wages increase by more than $1,300... For construction workers, it\u2019s $1,800 up... For miners, their wages went up $3,300.\" pic.twitter.com/C8CDUDGhCy \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nAnd on groceries:\n\n.@POTUS in Pennsylvania: \"Rent prices are down. Dairy prices are coming down very strongly. The cost of Thanksgiving turkeys was down by 33% compared to the Biden-era [high].\" pic.twitter.com/BVcEtTFXaa \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nPresident Trump also emphasized how he wants to approach (and improve) health insurance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n.@POTUS: \"Under Obamacare, trillions of dollars were given directly to health insurance companies...I want to give billions of dollars directly to the people...I want to give NOTHING to the insurance companies...We want you to go out and buy your own health insurance.\" pic.twitter.com/Yrr3dmZOmF \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nIn conjunction with the speech, the White House issued a statement highlighting the progress made in terms of lowering costs since Trump (re)took office 10 months ago \u2014 and promising more relief to come:\n\nSince taking office, President Donald J. Trump has made substantial progress reversing the inflation and cost-of-living disaster he inherited from the recklessness of the Biden Administration. Inflation has been cut by more than half, gas prices have fallen sharply, real wages are growing again, and key household expenses are finally heading in the right direction.\n\n\n\nBut President Trump is also clear: there is still important work ahead to ensure every American feels the full benefit of lower costs. While Democrats attempt to con Americans into believing they\u2019re the champions of affordability, the reality is that Democrats created the problem \u2014 and President Trump is stopping at nothing to fix it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement detailed the progress made on a number of economic fronts, including:\n\nInflation:\n\nUnder Biden, inflation averaged nearly 5% and hit 9.1% amid the worst inflation crisis in decades \u2014 fueled by the Radical Left\u2019s obsession with spending.\n\n\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s second term, inflation has dropped to an average of just 2.7% \u2014 the critical first step in reversing Democrats\u2019 cost-of-living disaster. In fact, under President Trump, Americans have even seen the first overall price decline since 2020.\n\nWages:\n\nUnder Biden, Americans workers lost over $2,900 in purchasing power because inflation rose faster than wages.\n\n\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s second term \u2014 even after accounting for higher prices \u2014 Americans\u2019 real wages have grown by nearly 4% \u2014 or nearly $700 \u2014 and are on track to grow by nearly $1,200 after his first full year in office.\n\nGas Prices:\n\nUnder Biden, gas prices were the highest they had ever been \u2014 even after he drained our strategic reserves to artificially decrease prices.\n\n\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s second term, gas prices have fallen to the lowest average price in 1,682 days and Americans on track to spend the lowest amount of their disposable income on gas in the last two decades. In fact, average gas prices have dipped below $3 per gallon in 36 states, below $2.75 per gallon in 20 states, and below $2.50 per gallon in five states \u2014 with prices below $2 per gallon at some stations in at least four states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also detailed progress on housing costs and groceries, and noted other economic wins like the tax cuts included in the One Big Beautiful Bill, deregulation, investment in the U.S., and deficit reduction.\n\nThe statement concluded with this:\n\nThe Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in. We\u2019re making progress \u2014 and the best is yet to come.\n\nIf \"affordability\" is the 2025 version of James Carville's \"It's the economy, stupid,\" President Trump and his administration are dialed in on making sure it's a message that becomes a winning one for the president and for Republicans \u2014 for Americans \u2014 as we head into the midterms.\n\nEditor's Note: Help RedState continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration's accomplishments as we continue to usher in the Golden Era of America.

He\u2019s breathing heavily.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, the loud whir of a drone appears. The soldier whispers a prayer and takes cover.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BOOM!</strong>\u00a0The drone explodes nearby. Screaming from a wounded soldier erupts.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve seen this situation play out dozens of times. For both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s a terrifying scenario. Sometimes I\u2019ll see a video where a group of soldiers is being attacked by dozens of these killer drones at a time. The whine of a drone\u2019s electric engine has become an ominous sound on the front lines.</strong></p>\n\n<p>These new weapons systems are cheap. A $300 civilian drone combined with a $50 RPG warhead can take out a $4 million tank. This is asymmetric warfare perfected. Tanks will likely maintain a role going forward, but it will be substantially diminished.</p>\n\n<p>Each side uses tens of thousands of these drones per month. They\u2019re so common that 12 gauge shotguns have become essential kit for soldiers on the front-lines. It turns out that birdshot is among the most effective counters. See\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://x.com/Mrgunsngear/status/1971279827413164388\">this video</a></strong>\u00a0for an example of how effective shotguns can be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But electronic warfare is also becoming a key defense against drones.

At first they were primarily a scouting tool, but now they\u2019ve become a deadly weapon.</p>\n\n<p>The abundance of weaponized drones on the battlefield has made advancing extremely difficult. A small hidden group armed with a few dozen drones can hold back hundreds of vehicles from advancing.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are also dozens of new models of military-grade drones being released every year. There are now mass-produced killer drones of all types being churned out by the tens of thousands. We covered some of the more important models<strong><a href=\"https://dailyreckoning.com/lindsey-graham-vs-putin/\">back in July.</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Ground and Sea Drones</strong></h2>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just flying drones. Unmanned ground combat vehicles (UGVs) are also coming into play. The screenshot below shows Ukraine\u2019s new UGVs armed with .50 caliber machine guns.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/dr-img2-12-05-25.jpg?itok=RGQB3b-i\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dr-img2-12-05-25.jpg?itok=RGQB3b-i\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e31f8bd4-2438-442b-b9f2-3f8253a6bae4\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"485\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dr-img2-12-05-25.jpg?itok=RGQB3b-i\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>For now, these ground-based drones are crude with limited range and ammunition. But within a few years they will evolve into intimidating juggernauts roaming the battlefield. In the near future tanks and artillery will also be unmanned.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Drone warfare extends to the seas. And Ukraine has nearly perfected this form of warfare.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Below is the Magura V5, a Ukrainian sea drone which has sunk a number of valuable Russian warships. </strong>It was commemorated with the stamp shown below by the Ukrainian postal service.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/dr-img3-12-05-25.jpg?itok=xBiTnEgW\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dr-img3-12-05-25.jpg?itok=xBiTnEgW\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"27e36845-7cb9-40fb-b010-18825b79c404\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"126\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dr-img3-12-05-25.jpg?itok=xBiTnEgW\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The latest version of the Magura can carry an explosive payload of 1,400 lbs.</strong> That\u2019s enough to sink almost any ship with proper placement. And the latest models even come equipped with anti-air missiles mounted on the top to counter Russian helicopters and jets.</p>\n\n<p>Sea (and submarine eventually) drones will be an absolutely critical aspect of future wars. Imagine a swarm of 50 of these high-speed sea drones converging on an aircraft carrier strike group, while a swarm of airborne drones attacks from above. It\u2019s virtually impossible to stop such an attack.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The age of mega-ships like aircraft carriers is drawing to a close.</strong> It seems likely that naval forces of the future will mostly consist of smaller missile boats and submarines.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Modern Missiles</strong></h2>\n\n<p>One part of this war which wasn\u2019t a surprise is Russia\u2019s missile advantage. The country has always specialized in long-range fires, because it realized it couldn\u2019t compete with NATO when it comes to traditional airpower (jets).</p>\n\n<p>That investment has proved to be a wise one. Missiles have been a key advantage in this war. From hypersonic models like the Kinzhal and Iskander-M, to cruise missiles like the Calibr and KH-101, they\u2019ve all been critical to Russia\u2019s progress in the war.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Iskander has been the most effective missile system of this war.</strong> The Iskander is a mobile ground-launched hypersonic missile which Russia mass produces.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/dr-img4-12-05-25.jpg?itok=W1yrVBJm\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dr-img4-12-05-25.jpg?itok=W1yrVBJm\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"a457d5ce-8f32-41fc-a97c-3b30bee38c3f\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"355\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dr-img4-12-05-25.jpg?itok=W1yrVBJm\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p><em>An Iskander-M launcher via\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K720_Iskander\">Wikipedia</a></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>The Iskander-M has a range of up to 500 kilometers and carries a warhead of up to 700kg (1,534 lbs). It moves fast, with a burnout speed of Mach 5.9. It can maneuver during flight, and contains decoys and flares which are released as it approaches its target. Each launcher carries 2 missiles and is often accompanied by a reloading vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>The Iskander-M has proven very difficult to intercept, as we\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://dailyreckoning.com/containing-china-is-becoming-untenable/\">covered back in October.</a></strong>\u00a0The Patriot missile defense system has mostly been outmatched by it.</p>\n\n<p>Iskander missiles are used to strike valuable targets such as command centers, Patriot missile defense systems, ammo/fuel depots, and HIMARS rocket launchers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speaking of HIMARS, this American-made rocket system has proven to be an extremely effective weapon for Ukraine.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/dr-img5-12-05-25.jpg?itok=q5UFh2J_\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/dr-img5-12-05-25.jpg?itok=q5UFh2J_\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"343a3bd0-1104-46db-90cf-8559cb09aca9\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/dr-img5-12-05-25.jpg?itok=q5UFh2J_\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p><em>HIMARS launching a guided rocket, via\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M142_HIMARS\">Wikipedia</a></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>The HIMARS system fires 227 mm guided rockets at ranges up to 150 km. The warheads are relatively small at around 200 lbs, but have proven effective at taking out enemy command centers and other valuable targets. Each \u201cpod\u201d contains 6 rockets and is disposable. HIMARS can also fire a single larger ATACMS missile with a ~450 lb warhead.</p>\n\n<p>Early on, the HIMARS was a wonder weapon for Ukraine, having devastating effects on Russian ammo/fuel depots and troop concentrations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, as the war has gone on, Russia has figured out how to \u201c<a href=\"https://thedefensepost.com/2024/05/27/us-himars-ineffective-ukraine/\">spoof</a>\u201d the satellite signals used to guide HIMARS rockets, and the weapons system has become less effective as a result. </strong>I\u2019m sure the engineers at Lockheed Martin are working on fixing this, but it\u2019s going to be an ongoing game of cat and mouse for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n<p>This is another takeaway from the Ukraine/Russia war. Electronic warfare is absolutely critical in modern conflicts.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>The Ukraine war has been a wakeup call to the world. </strong>Drones are going to be the focal point of future conflicts. When a $350 piece of equipment can take out a $4 million tank and 4 specialist soldiers, the game has changed.</p>\n\n<p>Soon, tanks and artillery units will also be unmanned.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Due to the rise of drones and unmanned systems, electronic warfare will become increasingly important. </strong>If you can jam the signal, you can stop the weapon. I expect future battlefields to be absolutely flooded with radio signals and microwaves.</p>\n\n<p>We didn\u2019t even get to AI in this piece, but will look to cover that in depth in the future. Drones and missiles are already becoming capable of autonomous action. But both sides are understandably secretive about their capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that the hunter-killer robots from The Terminator are moving from sci-fi to reality.</p>\n\n<p>Combined with this new generation of hypersonic missiles, it\u2019s a completely different landscape than it was just 20 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>I am hopeful the war in Ukraine ends soon, but it has given us a rare peek into what modern warfare truly looks like. And it\u2019s terrifying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is the age of asymmetric warfare. </strong>Pinpoint long-range weapons systems have eliminated the advantage of large troop concentrations and capital ships like aircraft carriers.</p>\n\n<p>For a long time, only superpowers like America and Russia had access to these types of systems. Now they have proliferated throughout the world. The implications have yet to be fully realized.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T04:25:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Tue, 12/09/2025 - 23:25</span>\n",

Trump spoke about Beckstrom, who he said was looking down \u201cfrom Heaven, from above.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, I got a call that he got up from bed,\u201d Trump told the crowd about Wolfe. \u201cDo you believe that? He got up. He got up. Now, he didn\u2019t speak, he\u2019s not ready for that yet\u2026\u2026but, he got up and boy, they\u2019re so happy. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nTrump also revealed that he had called Wolfe\u2019s hospital room and spoken to his mother, Monica, who he described as \u201cthe most positive person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe night that he was so badly hit and the doctors gave him almost no chance, I call their hospital room and spoke to her, and she said, \u2018Sir, he\u2019ll be fine,'\u201d Trump shared, adding that Wolfe\u2019s mother kept insisting that her son would \u201cbe fine.\u201d\n\nThe President also spoke about how he had invited Wolfe\u2019s family to the Oval Office and Wolfe\u2019s mother told him, \u201cSir, he\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come after a gunman, who officials have identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, opened fire near the Farragut West Metro Station. As a result of the shooting, the White House was placed on lockdown.\n\nDuring a press conference after the shooting, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeannine Pirro shared that Lakanwal had entered the United States in September 2021 under the Biden administration\u2019s Operation Allies Welcome.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe has also shared that Lakanwal had worked with the agency \u201cas a member of a partner force in Kandahar, Afghanistan.\u201d During an interview with Fox News, Ratcliffe also shared that Lakanwal \u201cand so many others\u2014should have never been allowed\u201d to come to the U.S.",

    "full_content": "Israel\u2019s Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana and House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday unveiled what they called a first-of-its-kind global parliamentary bid to nominate President Donald J. Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, declaring that \u201cno one has ever deserved that honor more\u201d and that \u201cno person in the world has done more for peace over the past year.\u201d\n\nMeeting at the U.S. Capitol, Johnson hosted Ohana for a bilateral session in which the two speakers signed a formal letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee and launched an effort to rally speakers and presidents of parliaments worldwide to join the nomination. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise also took part in the meeting.\n\nIn a press release announcing the move, Johnson said that by restoring the American doctrine of \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d President Trump \u201cmade history by ending conflicts and encouraging order around the globe,\u201d insisting that \u201cno one has ever deserved that honor more.\u201d\n\nOhana, calling the initiative \u201ca cause that is just, moral, and as right as any can be,\u201d said there is \u201cnot a single person in the world who has done more for peace over the past year than President Trump, and no one more deserving of recognition for the efforts and the results that have saved the lives of so many people around the world, including in Israel.\u201d\n\nThe joint letter \u2014 addressed to the Nobel Committee in Oslo and signed by Johnson and Ohana as speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Israeli Knesset \u2014 presents Trump as \u201can extraordinary leader whose pursuit of peace has changed the world,\u201d and stresses that, for the first time in modern history, parliamentary leaders are uniting \u201cin one voice\u201d behind his candidacy.\n\nThe pair says they will now circulate the text globally and invite counterparts to add their signatures ahead of the January 31, 2026, nomination deadline.\n\nLaying out the case, the letter cites eight specific diplomatic achievements it credits to Trump: his 20-Point Peace Plan for Gaza; the Abraham Accords; a ceasefire between India and Pakistan; a truce and peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia; reconciliation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda; a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia; economic normalization between Serbia and Kosovo; and Trump\u2019s role in easing tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia.\n\nThe document says this record reflects \u201cexceptional statesmanship and uncommon courage in confronting long-standing hostilities with vision, creativity, and resolve.\u201d\n\nThe speakers argue that Trump\u2019s mediation has \u201cchanged the world\u201d by bringing an end to bloody conflicts in \u201cno fewer than eight regions\u201d and by securing the return of all living hostages from Hamas captivity as part of his Gaza framework \u2014 an achievement Johnson has described as a \u201chistoric moment\u201d that \u201cdeserves enormous credit and recognition on the world stage.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, they contend that under the Nobel\u2019s founding principles, \u201cno individual did more to advance peace in 2025 than President Trump,\u201d and that \u201cfew, if any, have done more in history to advance the cause of peace \u2014 and none are more worthy of this honor.\u201d\n\nJohnson framed the new push as the continuation of an effort he and Ohana first announced in mid-October, when the Israeli speaker told Trump in a special Knesset session that he would work with the House speaker to rally parliaments around the world behind a Nobel bid, declaring, \u201cPresident Trump, you are the President of Peace.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Johnson told reporters in Washington that \u201cno one has ever deserved that prize more,\u201d vowing to coordinate a broad international campaign among his counterparts.\n\nThe October appeals from civil society and political leaders set the early stage.\n\nOn October 6, families of Israeli hostages \u2014 together with relatives of those already returned \u2014 wrote to the Norwegian Nobel Committee \u201cwith momentous urgency,\u201d urging it to award President Trump the Peace Prize and crediting his diplomacy with making possible what \u201cmany said was impossible.\u201d\n\nDays later, on October 9, world leaders, lawmakers, and public figures amplified the push in a separate appeal, arguing that \u201cno leader has done more for peace\u201d and warning that if Trump did not receive the prize, \u201cno one deserves it.\u201d\n\nThose letters landed in the final days before the committee made its decision.\n\nAt that point, Trump\u2019s Gaza framework was still being finalized, and the last hostages remained in Hamas captivity.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, that framework was implemented: all remaining living hostages held in Gaza were brought home, and \u2014 under the ceasefire and hostage-exchange arrangement \u2014 all known bodies but one were returned, as part of what officials in Jerusalem and Washington have described as a broader effort to end the war and lock in a more stable regional architecture.\n\nWith Phase One now essentially complete \u2014 short of the single remaining body still held in Gaza \u2014 officials say the process is shifting toward Phase Two of Trump\u2019s 20-Point Peace Plan, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled to meet President Trump on December 29 to discuss the transition and outline the next steps.\n\nOn October 10, however, the Nobel Committee announced that it would award the 2025 peace prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a move widely seen in Israel as a snub of Trump\u2019s record and of the appeals filed in the days prior.\n\nWithin hours of the Oslo decision, Israel Prize laureate Ronny Douek moved on a different track, formally nominating Trump for the Israel Prize for Lifetime Achievement and Special Contribution to Society and the State \u2014 the country\u2019s highest civilian honor, often described as its \u201cIsraeli Nobel.\u201d\n\nIn his nomination, Douek pointed to Trump\u2019s then-ongoing efforts to secure the return of the hostages and bring the Gaza war to an end \u201cin a way that will guarantee security and stability for Israel,\u201d even as the captives were still being held, and urged Israel to honor him on the upcoming Independence Day.\n\nHe framed the case broadly, arguing that Trump \u201cacted with great determination, courage, and a deep love for the people of Israel,\u201d that he \u201cpaved a new path of hope and regional partnership,\u201d and that thanks to his direct leadership, historic peace agreements were achieved, Israel\u2019s security interests were preserved, and \u201cgenuine hope for a better future\u201d was established.\n\nDouek\u2019s letter also pointed back to first-term milestones that, in his view, set the stage: U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and the 2018 embassy move; recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights in 2019; and the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, later joined by additional Arab states.\n\nTaken together with Trump\u2019s current diplomacy, he argued, that record makes the Israel Prize the natural venue to recognize a leader he called \u201cmore committed than any other in our generation\u201d to Israel\u2019s security and to peace in the region.\n\nThe Nobel panel has stood by its choice of Machado, citing her struggle to restore democracy in Venezuela.\n\nBut Johnson and Ohana say the coming year offers the committee a fresh opportunity \u2014 and that Trump\u2019s record over the past year alone, capped by the hostage deal and Gaza framework, fits Alfred Nobel\u2019s mandate to recognize those who have done \u201cthe most or the best work\u201d to advance peace and fraternity between nations.\n\nTheir new parliamentary campaign is explicitly designed to put that question back on the committee\u2019s desk for 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, recognition of Trump\u2019s peacemaking has broadened well beyond the Nobel track.\n\nOn Friday, FIFA President Gianni Infantino awarded Trump the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize at the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, calling him a leader whose \u201cexceptional and extraordinary actions\u201d have promoted peace and unity across the globe \u2014 from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to India and Pakistan \u2014 and reading a citation crediting him with making \u201cthe world a safer place.\u201d\n\nTrump, calling the honor \u201ctruly one of the great honors of my life,\u201d said that \u201cbeyond the awards \u2026 we saved millions and millions of lives.\u201d\n\nFor now, Johnson and Ohana say their immediate goal is to convert what has been a patchwork of letters, endorsements, and symbolic honors into a single, coordinated parliamentary effort \u2014 one that, in their words, reflects \u201cdeep respect and sincere regard\u201d for a president they present as uniquely responsible for \u201ca monumental stride toward the realization of peace in our time,\u201d and that will test whether the Nobel institution is prepared to follow suit.\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Mr. [Eagles owner Jeffrey] Lurie, it\u2019s either me or Kevin.\u2019 \u2026If Kevin is not fired, put 25 back out there on the street. Let one of the rookies get it.\"</p><p>It\u2019s a bold take by \"Shady\" McCoy, but he sides with many Eagles fans who have gone after Patullo all season with the reigning <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/super-bowl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Bowl</a> champions not producing on offense like they believed they would in 2025.</p><p>The Eagles head into the final four games of the regular season ranked 24th in yards per game (309.4) in the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NFL</a> after finishing eighth in that category in 2024. Philadelphia is also 22nd in rushing yards totaled per game (110.5) despite Saquon Barkley running for over 2,000 last season in his first year as an Eagles star.</p><p>Finally, the Eagles are 19th in points per game (22.2), which has gotten the job done most nights thanks to tremendous defensive play. The Eagles\u2019 defense gave Hurts and company numerous opportunities on \"Monday Night Football\" at SoFi Stadium, but the turnovers ultimately came back to haunt them, including a game-sealing interception by Tony Jefferson at the Chargers\u2019 goal line, marking Hurts\u2019 fourth pick of the night.</p><p>The struggles have even led some radical Eagles fans to throw eggs at Patullo\u2019s New Jersey home, which was seen in a viral video.</p><p>During the podcast\u2019s segment, McCoy was defending Hurts despite playing one of his worst games of his career on Monday night, while also not throwing shade at head coach Nick Sirianni.</p><p>In his eyes, it\u2019s all Patullo, and he wants him gone by next season.</p><p>\"Give the kicker my number if Kevin is still there. Kevin bee on some bullc\u2014,\" McCoy added.</p><p>With four games remaining until the playoffs, the Eagles find themselves still in playoff position as leaders of the NFC East. If the season ended today, they would have the No. 3 seed in the NFC and face the San Francisco 49ers at home in South Philly.</p><p>But with such a tight playoff race \u2014 the Dallas Cowboys at 6-6-1 are still in play for the division title \u2014 the Eagles could be facing desperation mode if they don\u2019t figure things out offensively moving forward.</p><p>It\u2019s an easier schedule than most, though, for the Eagles in their final four games, as they\u2019re set to face the Las Vegas Raiders (2-11) at home in Week 15, followed by the Washington Commanders (3-10), Buffalo Bills (9-4) and Commanders one last time in Week 18.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s</strong></i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>\u00a0sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>\u00a0and subscribe to</strong></i><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>\u00a0the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

Further investigation revealed that the donor had become infected with the fatal virus after saving a kitten from a skunk.\u00a0</p><p>The unnamed patient, from <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michigan</a>, received the donor\u2019s kidney in December 2024, and later developed severe symptoms that prompted hospitalization and \"invasive\" procedures, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.</p><p>He reportedly experienced fever, tremors, difficulty swallowing and fear of water and died 51 days after the transplant.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health/silent-killer-parasitic-disease-spreading-across-multiple-us-states-experts-warn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>\u2018SILENT KILLER\u2019 PARASITIC DISEASE SPREADING ACROSS MULTIPLE US STATES, EXPERTS WARN</u></strong></a></p><p>The CDC said the donor, whose donated tissue went to three other recipients, was infected with the silver-haired bat variant of rabies, suggesting the skunk had been infected by a bat.</p><p>Records revealed that the organ donor, from Idaho, was scratched on the shin while fending off a skunk that displayed \"predatory aggression\" six weeks before his death.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"In late October 2024, a skunk approached the donor as he held a kitten in an outbuilding on his rural property,\" the CDC said. \"During an encounter that rendered the skunk unconscious, the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">donor sustained a shin scratch</a> that bled, but he did not think he had been bitten.

He was reportedly revived at a hospital but was declared brain-dead and removed from life support. \u00a0</p><p>The CDC said his organs were donated after the family documented the skunk encounter in a donor risk assessment. However, health officials noted that the form did not screen for rabies, citing its \"rarity in humans.\"</p><p>\"In the United States, potential donors\u2019 family members often provide information about a donor\u2019s infectious disease risk factors, including animal exposures,\" the CDC said. \"Rabies is excluded from routine donor pathogen testing because of its rarity in humans in the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States</a> and the complexity of diagnostic testing. In this case, hospital staff members who treated the donor were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his pre-admission signs and symptoms to chronic comorbidities.\"</p><p>Health officials added that three other patients received corneal tissue from the same infected donor. They all\u00a0underwent graft removal, received rabies treatment and remained asymptomatic, the CDC reported.</p><p>Health officials also reached out to 370 people who could have been in contact with the donor, according to the agency.

If we call a drug smuggler a combatant, how many combatants died when SEAL Team 6 <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/03/trump-orders-strike-on-suspected-venezuelan-gang-boat-in-caribbean/\">killed</a> 11 men on a cocaine boat near Venezuela on September 2?</p>\n<p>Zero, because calling a drug smuggler a combatant does not make him a combatant. That reality goes to the heart of the morally and legally bankrupt justification for President Donald Trump's <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/16/another-military-strike-on-a-speedboat-confirms-trumps-policy-of-murdering-suspected-drug-smugglers/\">bloodthirsty anti-drug campaign</a> in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, which began on September 2 and so far has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/29/us/us-caribbean-pacific-boat-strikes.html\">killed</a> 87 people in 22 attacks.</p>\n<p>The September 2 operation is <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/01/kill-everybody/\">newly controversial</a> because it included a follow-up missile strike that <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/08/hegseth-mulls-releasing-a-video-that-illustrates-the-brutality-of-trumps-murderous-anti-drug-strategy/\">blew apart</a>\u00a0two defenseless survivors of the initial attack as they clung to the smoldering wreckage. But all these attacks entail the use of deadly force in circumstances that do not justify it.</p>\n<p>Trump\u00a0<a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/11/trump-calls-his-drone-strike-on-an-alleged-drug-boat-self-defense-it-looks-more-like-murder/\">conflates</a>\u00a0drug smuggling with violent aggression,\u00a0<a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/03/defending-the-summary-execution-of-suspected-drug-smugglers-trump-declares-an-armed-conflict/\">saying</a>\u00a0it amounts to \"an armed attack against the United States\" that requires a lethal military response. According to that\u00a0<a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/04/boat-attack-commander-says-he-had-to-kill-2-survivors-because-they-were-still-trying-to-smuggle-cocaine/\">counterintuitive theory</a>, suspected cocaine smugglers are \"combatants\" who can be killed at will, and their vessels pose a \"threat\" to national security that can be neutralized only by completely destroying them.</p>\n<p>In reality, Americans want cocaine, and criminal organizations are happy to supply it. The government does not approve of that trade, which it has long sought to suppress by interdicting cocaine and arresting smugglers.</p>\n<p>Trump, who accurately <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/11/16/trump-says-stopping-suspected-drug-boats-doesnt-work-us-reports-record-cocaine-seizures.html\">calls</a> that approach \"totally ineffective,\" thinks killing suspected drug couriers, from a distance and in cold blood, will achieve the impossible goal of preventing Americans from consuming politically disfavored intoxicants. He is <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/17/trump-erroneously-thinks-killing-suspected-smugglers-is-the-key-to-winning-the-drug-war/\">wrong</a> about that. But even if he were right, the goal of disrupting and deterring drug smuggling would not justify summarily executing criminal suspects without legal authorization or any semblance of due process.</p>\n<p>That is why Trump <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/03/defending-the-summary-execution-of-suspected-drug-smugglers-trump-declares-an-armed-conflict/\">claims</a> the U.S. military is at war with \"narco-terrorists.\" But the \"non-international armed conflict\" that Trump perceives does not fit the <a href=\"https://www.undrr.org/understanding-disaster-risk/terminology/hips/so0102\">legal definition</a> of that term and has not been recognized by Congress.</p>\n<p>The resulting violence is so one-sided that the government's lawyers <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/03/trump-says-his-armed-conflict-with-drug-traffickers-does-not-involve-hostilities/\">claim</a> blowing up suspected drug boats does not qualify as \"hostilities\" under the War Powers Resolution because U.S. personnel face no plausible risk of casualties. So we are talking about an \"armed conflict\" that does not involve \"hostilities\" yet somehow does involve enemy \"combatants,\" albeit combatants who are not actually engaged in combat.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/08/hegseth-mulls-releasing-a-video-that-illustrates-the-brutality-of-trumps-murderous-anti-drug-strategy/\">debate</a> about the September 2 attack underlines that point. Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who commanded the operation, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/admiral-told-lawmakers-everyone-alleged-drug-boat-was-list-military-ta-rcna247767\">told</a> lawmakers the boat was heading for Suriname\u2014i.e., <em>away</em> from the United States\u2014with cocaine ultimately destined for Europe or Africa.</p>\n<p>Even if you accept the preposterous premise that transporting cocaine is equivalent to an \"armed attack,\" it is hard to see how this boat posed any sort of threat to the United States. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth nevertheless deemed it a legitimate military target, and he <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-cabinet-meeting-december-2-2025/\">says</a> Bradley \"made the correct decision to ultimately sink the boat and eliminate the threat.\"</p>\n<p>According to Hegseth, that \"threat\" remained even after the capsized bow was all that remained of the boat.

These materials are vital for defense technologies, electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, aerospace components, and advanced electronics, positioning Round Top as the foundation of USAR\u2019s fully integrated \u201cmine-to-magnet\u201d supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>That supply chain also includes:</p>\n\n<ul><li>\n\t<p>a 310,000 sq. ft. magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma, expected to become the largest metal-and-alloy-making and strip-casting facility outside China, and</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>a processing and separation laboratory in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, supporting domestic mineral refinement and separation.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><p>CEO Barbara Humpton said the accelerated production schedule reflects the company\u2019s growing technical edge and its commitment to strengthen U.S. supply chains amid rising global demand for permanent magnets and heightened geopolitical risk. She called the new timeline an \u201cexciting milestone\u201d made possible by the team\u2019s process engineering, scientific capabilities, and operational ingenuity.</p>\n\n<p>The revised schedule stems from strong solvent-extraction piloting. USAR plans to launch its Hydromet demonstration facility in Colorado in early 2026, where five extraction circuits will run continuously for 2,000\u20134,000 hours to generate final commercial design data. These circuits will isolate high-value heavy rare earths\u2014especially dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb), essential for high-strength magnets\u2014while also producing other strategic minerals such as hafnium and zirconium.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.16.41.jpg?itok=sdMmSYOX\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.16.41.jpg?itok=sdMmSYOX\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"63bd668a-79fe-4fc1-93ec-2d4d0f9776d0\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"306\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.16.41.jpg?itok=sdMmSYOX\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>This parallel-processing approach is projected to save tens of millions of dollars and enable completion of a definitive feasibility study by early 2027. With those milestones accelerated, USAR anticipates entering commercial production in 2028, creating earlier cash flow opportunities while bolstering a secure domestic supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>The news also intersects with rising political emphasis on reshoring strategic minerals. During the Trump administration, rare earth supply security became a national priority amid escalating trade tensions with China, which dominates global processing. Trump issued executive actions directing agencies to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign minerals, opened pathways for funding domestic mining projects, and prioritized rare earths in defense procurement. Continued focus on critical mineral independence in a second Trump term will likely further support companies like USAR as they work to build a fully <em><strong>domestic</strong></em> mine-to-magnet ecosystem.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T14:30:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 09:30</span>\n",

A full preview is available in the Newsquawk Research Suite. Overnight attention has centred on trade developments, with CNBC noting that China has resumed purchases of US soybeans, though it remains behind the targets outlined in the Trump trade deal. On the Fed front, the FT reported that President Trump is set to begin the final round of interviews for the next Fed Chair, with senior officials still viewing White House NEC Director Hassett as the leading candidate.</li>\n\t<li><strong>G10s have been moving in tandem with the USD</strong>.\u00a0<strong>EUR</strong>\u00a0was unreactive to earlier remarks from ECB\u2019s Villeroy and Simkus, with Villeroy concentrating on the French economy, while Simkus indicated that further rate cuts are unnecessary \u2014 a view echoed by market pricing, which suggests rates will remain unchanged through 2026. Further for the EUR, on Tuesday, the French National Assembly approved the social security budget in a narrow vote, passing by just 13 votes \u2014 a close outcome in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. Notably, all of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance lawmakers backed the bill, while Les R\u00e9publicains showed a more divided stance. For GBP, recent BoE commentary has offered little new for UK rates.\u00a0<strong>EUR/USD</strong>\u00a0is choppy within a 1.1622-1.1658 range, with GBP/USD in a 1.3296-1.3327 band.</li>\n\t<li><strong>USD/JPY is flat after Tuesday\u2019s rise to just below the 157.00 level</strong>, which prompted the usual round of verbal intervention from Japanese officials. Meanwhile, PPI figures overnight came in as expected and had minimal effect on the currency. USD/JPY trades in a narrow 156.56-156.94 range vs Tuesday's 156.96 high.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Antipodeans</strong>\u00a0trade in tandem with the USD in a quiet FX session, with overall risk sentiment muted ahead of the Fed decision. Chinese inflation data overnight were mixed \u2014 CPI rose to its fastest pace in nearly two years, while a softer-than-expected PPI reading pointed to deeper deflation at the factory gate.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Fixed Income</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>USTs started the European session flat</strong>, but have since slipped marginally into the red, alongside global peers. Currently trading at the bottom end of a 111-30 to 112-04+ range \u2013 the trough marks a new weekly low and is now trading at levels not seen since early September. From a yield perspective, rates are higher across the curve, with the belly leading. Focus overnight has been on trade developments, with CNBC reporting that China is buying US soybeans again, but is reportedly falling short of the goal set by the Trump trade agreement. Turning to the Fed, the FT reported that President Trump will begin the final round of Fed Chair interviews \u2013 but senior officials still expect the White House NEC Director Hassett as the frontrunner. Now attention turns to the FOMC later today.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Bunds are also on the back foot and underperforming vs peers</strong>, but nothing really behind the underperformance in EGBs. Bunds Mar\u201926 is currently trading towards the lower end of a 127.05 to 127.49 range, with the trough marking a contract low. Earlier, there was some commentary via ECB\u2019s Villeroy and Simkus, where the former focused on the French economy, whilst the latter suggested that the policy rate does not need to be lowered further \u2013 a move also concurred by market pricing, which sees rates steady through 2026. Elsewhere,\u00a0<strong>Gilts also hold a negative bias and hold at the bottom end of a 90.71 to 91.04 range</strong>. Recent BoE speak has been non-incremental for UK paper.</li>\n\t<li><strong>OATs are also in the red, and to a similar magnitude as peers.</strong>\u00a0French political developments on Tuesday saw the National Assembly approve the social security budget. The bill narrowly passed with 13 votes, with analysts expecting a tight decision; interestingly, all of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance voted in favour, whilst the Les Republicans were a little more mixed.

So the S&P 500 (-0.09%) posted a modest decline, and futures for the index (-0.01%) remain flat this morning. However, the bond selloff continued in several places, with 10yr Treasury yields (+2.4bps) drifting up to a three-month high as investors kept dialling back their expectations for rate cuts next year. In fact in Australia overnight, their 10yr yield (+3.7bps) has just hit its highest level since late-2023, so that momentum has shown few signs of letting up. To be fair it wasn\u2019t all bad news, with the Franco-German 10yr spread closing at its tightest since August, shortly before lawmakers went on to back the social security budget. But as investors have pivoted to expect rate hikes next year for many countries, sovereign bonds have struggled across the board.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to the Fed\u2019s decision tonight, it\u2019s widely expected that they\u2019ll deliver another 25bp rate cut, which would be the third consecutive rate cut since the September meeting. At their last meeting in late-October, Chair Powell had said that a December cut was \u201cnot a foregone conclusion \u2013 far from it.\u201d But since then, the subsequent jobs report for September showed a further uptick in the unemployment rate, to 4.4%, which strengthened the dovish arguments and led markets to price back in another cut for today. So futures are pricing in a 90% chance of a cut as we go to press.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\nBeyond the immediate policy decision, our US economists also expect there to be dissents in both a hawkish and dovish direction. So to forge a consensus behind a rate cut today, they anticipate the statement and press conference will signal that the hurdle is relatively high for another cut in early 2026. Remember as well that we\u2019ll also get the latest Summary of Economic Projections, containing the dot plot for where officials expect rates to move in the years ahead. Our economists think the median dots will stay unchanged, consistent with one further 25bp cut in each of 2026 and 2027. See their full preview here for more details.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Beyond today however, there\u2019s been mounting speculation more broadly that central banks are increasingly finished with their rate cutting cycles. Indeed, those moves got further support after the latest batch of US data, which showed that job openings rose to a 5-month high of 7.670m in October (vs. 7.117m expected). So that pushed back against fears of a deteriorating labour market and helped push front-end Treasury yields higher. Admittedly, there were some less positive details, and the quits rate of those voluntarily leaving their job fell to a 5-year low of 1.8%. But overall, investors were reassured by the rise in openings, with the amount of Fed cuts priced by December 2026 down by -5.7bps to 72bps. And in turn, the 2yr Treasury yield (+3.8bps) moved up to 3.61%, whilst the 10yr yield (+2.4bps) rose to 4.19%.</p>\n\n<p>Staying on the Fed, the FT reported yesterday that Trump would soon conduct a final round of interviews with the candidates for Fed Chair. The article said that officials thought NEC Director Kevin Hassett was still \u201cin pole position\u201d, and Trump separately said to reporters on Air Force One that \u201cI have a pretty good idea of who I want\u201d. Interestingly though, the article floated that there had been discussion about Hassett serving a shorter term, potentially by moving into Powell\u2019s seat on the Board of Governors, which expires in January 2028. So that would leave the option of nominating a different Fed Chair later in Trump\u2019s term. We did hear from Hassett as well yesterday, who said there was \u201cplenty of room\u201d for more cuts, although markets didn\u2019t have too much reaction given that was in line with his previous comments for more easing. However, the FT report saw Hassett\u2019s odds of becoming chair move a bit lower on Polymarket, and they currently stand at 71% as we go to press this morning.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, equities didn\u2019t see too much of a reaction to all this, with the S&P 500 (-0.09%) posting a marginal decline, whilst the NASDAQ (+0.13%) and small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.21%) both moved higher. In terms of the outperformers, the Magnificent 7 (+0.26%) did see a stronger gain, but traditional blue chip stocks underperformed amid higher rates, leaving the Dow Jones down -0.38%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan (-4.66%) was the third-worst performer in the S&P 500 after warning of higher-than-expected costs.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Over in Europe, the spotlight was on France yesterday, where lawmakers backed the social security budget with a narrow 247-234 margin in the final vote. However, achieving this majority came at the cost of a higher underlying deficit for 2026 because of the pension reform suspension and increased health spending. Nevertheless, the signs of progress were met positively by markets, and the Franco-German 10yr spread reached its tightest since late-August yesterday, at 71bps. However, the political fragmentation is still clear, and attention will now turn to the State budget, which is due to be approved no later than December 23 and where agreement remains distant.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in Europe, sovereign bonds rallied across the board, with yields on 10yr bunds (-1.2bps), OATs (-2.8bps) and BTPs (-1.8bps) all falling back. However, for equities it was more mixed, with the STOXX 600 (-0.10%) narrowly losing ground. That came amidst an outperformance in Germany, with the DAX up +0.49% after Bloomberg reported that lawmakers were set to approve \u20ac52bn in defence orders next week. The news saw defence stocks outperform, with the STOXX Aerospace & Defense Index up +0.79%, whilst Rheinmetall was up +3.56%.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Overnight in Asia, we\u2019ve seen losses across the major equity indices before the Fed\u2019s decision. Chinese equities have struggled, with the CSI 300 (-0.88%) and the Shanghai Comp (-0.76%) posting declines, but we\u2019ve also seen losses for the KOSPI (-0.27%) and the Nikkei (-0.44%) as well. Staying on China, the latest data overnight has shown that CPI inflation moved up to +0.7% in November, an increase from +0.2% in October. The move was in line with consensus, but also marks the fastest pace since February 2024. However, PPI inflation remained in deflationary territory for a 38th consecutive month, coming in at -2.2% (vs. -2.0% expected).\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To the day ahead, the biggest event will be the FOMC\u2019s decision and Chair Powell\u2019s press conference. Other central bank events will be the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision, and we\u2019ll also hear from ECB President Lagarde.\u00a0 In terms of economic releases, we\u2019ll see the US Q3 employment cost index, and Italy\u2019s industrial production for October.

We can have multiple overlapping stories--Jungian psychology, general theory of relativity, Keynesian economics, and so on--but we need a story that explains key elements of our experience and what we observe and \"know,\" with\u00a0<em>know</em>\u00a0in quotes to indicate that\u00a0<strong>the story we embrace defines what we\u00a0<em>know</em>\u00a0and what we can\u00a0<em>know</em>.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Given this need for a story, we can only relinquish a story that's failing to account for what we observe if we have a\u00a0<em>better story</em>\u00a0available:</strong>\u00a0and by \"better\" I mean one that more accurately accounts for what we observe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This substitution of a new story for an existing story that no longer\u00a0<em>makes sense</em>\u00a0(i.e. offers constructive predictions) of the world is easily confused with another human trait:</strong>\u00a0the power of\u00a0<em>the Powers That Be</em>\u00a0rest on a foundational story, and replacing this story removes the source of their power. Replacing the story that empowers them discredits their claim to superiority, effectively stripping away their entitlement to authority and their overweening delusions of grandiosity that come with entering the ranks of\u00a0<em>the Powers That Be</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This desire to maintain the status quo story as part of maintaining their authority and power is the core dynamic described by Thomas Kuhn in his classic\u00a0<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4a1Ntqw\">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a></strong>: the Old Guard who embraced the story that the universe revolves around the Earth resists accepting the new story that the Earth is an inconsequential minor planet that orbits the sun in a local system which is in motion in much larger structures even as all the observational data undermines their story and supports the new story.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fast-forward to the present and we have multiple Old Guards clinging to ideological stories that no longer track what we observe.</strong>\u00a0Yet like all previous Old Guards,\u00a0<em>the Powers That Be</em>\u00a0are loathe to accept a new story that strips away their claim to authority and all the perquisites of power they currently enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We live in a world torn between the artifices needed to make \"the Earth is the center of the Universe\" somewhat plausible even as that story crumbles into incoherence and the formation of a new story that actually tracks reality.</strong>\u00a0In terms of a metaphor, consider a glossy \"lifestyle\" publication that simultaneously touts a new chocolate cake recipe that is simply out of this world and a new diet to slim down in a healthier way than taking meds with horrible side effects that must be taken for life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No wonder the world seems deranged--it is deranged by the immense strength of an Old Guard clinging onto power\u00a0<em>by any means available</em>\u00a0even as the world around them spins into incoherence.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Economic incoherence:</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/cartoon-profit_0.jpg?itok=UNPArq9I\" data-link-option=\"0\"

In some cities, buyers must now have more than $200,000 to afford the median-priced home.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cNationally, over 75 percent of U.S. homes on the market are unaffordable to the typical household,\u201d</strong></em> Bankrate said.</p>\n\n<p>Typical households must make at least $33,000 more to afford median-priced homes.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the 34 largest American metros analyzed by Bankrate, only about a dozen have more than 30 percent of properties that a typical household can afford, the company said. This affects even markets long considered to be affordable, such as San Antonio, Charlotte, and Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>San Francisco had the highest income requirement, with prospective buyers having to make $353,500 annually to purchase a typical home</strong>. This was followed by Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City, and Seattle, all of which require more than $200,000 in income.</p>\n\n<p>Detroit was the cheapest metro area, requiring only an income of $66,700 to buy a home. This was followed by Pittsburgh and Louisville, both of which required less than $80,000.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cAnyone earning the median U.S. income will find themselves priced out of three out of every four U.S. homes on the market,\u201d Bankrate said.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\u201cA big reason why: there simply aren\u2019t enough homes up for sale right now. Homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the pandemic have been staying put, and builders haven\u2019t kept up with demand since the Great Recession.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cAt the same time, home prices soared during the pandemic, followed by the steepest rise in mortgage rates in about two decades. With wages struggling to keep up, housing affordability has reached historically low levels in recent years.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p>The average sales price of homes sold in the United States jumped from $371,100 in the second quarter of 2020 to $512,800 in the same period this year, an increase of more than 38 percent over a five-year period, according to <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=CpFW\">data</a> from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.19 percent for the week ending Dec. 4, according to <a href=\"https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms\">data</a> from Freddie Mac. This is more than double the 2.71 percent rate roughly five years ago.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amid high housing costs, inventory growth is slowing down,</strong> real estate brokerage Redfin said in a Dec. 4 <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/press-releases/redfin-reports-inventory-growth-loses-steam-as-would-be-sellers-react-to-lackluster-homebuying-demand/\">statement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Total housing supply is losing steam, and new home listings are stalling, the brokerage said.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe pool of buyers is small partly because we\u2019re entering the slow season for real estate, but it\u2019s also because houses are expensive, rates are elevated, and people are feeling cautious about their pocketbooks,\u201d said Carlos Castillo, a Redfin Premier agent in Los Angeles.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cHouse hunters may be able to find a deal because there are more sellers than buyers, but I\u2019m advising buyers to be strategic.

The description of the system being a \"new\" defense capability is interesting, however.</p>\n\n<p>\"The tragedy occurred during training, and we extend our condolences to the family and loved ones,\" the statement added, emphasizing that it was not combat related.</p>\n\n<p>The British soldier may have been observing active combat from a distance, as <em>Financial Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dddb71e-a472-4bb0-a844-07c87e8ea6ff\">suggests</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>An MoD spokesperson said the death <strong>was not believed to have been caused by hostile fire</strong>, and the soldier had been injured \u201cwhilst observing Ukrainian forces test a new defensive capability, away from the front lines\u201d. The serviceman, whose name has not been released, died on Tuesday morning. His family has been informed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While there have over the years of the Ukraine war been reports of British security contractors and volunteers dying while fighting Russia, <strong>this marks a rare - and possibly first - known death of an <em>active </em>UK service member in the country</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As <em>The Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/member-uk-armed-forces-killed-accident-ukraine-mod\">observes</a>, \"A Ukrainian memorial produced by the Kyiv war museum has <strong>counted that 40 Britons have died defending Ukraine</strong>, a higher number than previously thought. <strong>None are known to have been serving in the British military at the time of their death</strong>.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to more from FT:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In July, UK Defence Secretary John Healey told parliament that UK personnel were in Ukraine to scout new security arrangements to support Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. He said planning included <strong>\"reconnaissance in Ukraine, led by UK personnel\"</strong>.\u00a0 </em></p>\n\n<p><em>The circumstances of the accident remain unclear, including what was being tested and how the soldier came to be fatally injured. Ukrainian forces have been trialling a range of new defensive technologies \u2014 from counter-drone systems to new long-range missiles \u2014 as they continue to adapt to evolving battlefield threats.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Britain all the way back closer to the start of the war in 2022 became among the first Western countries to begin hosting Ukrainian troop training programs on its soil.

This is a censorship-by-proxy strategy. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from 2020 to 2022, and Europe today, have authorized government-funded NGOs to demand censorship of social media platforms in an attempt to deceive the public.</p>\n\n<p>As such, <strong>the European Commission is spreading disinformation in order to demand censorship, and is openly engaged in a deception campaign aimed at confusing the people of Europe and the United States about what it is doing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many Americans may rightly wonder why they should care about what the European government is doing. President Donald Trump shut down much of the US censorship industrial complex, including by the DHS.</p>\n\n<p>The reason we should care is that <strong>the goal of the European Commission, like that of the governments of Britain, Brazil, and Australia, is to censor the American people. </strong>As Public was the first to report in October, a pro-censorship activist think tank, the Stanford Cyberpolicy Center, hosted a gathering of global censorship officials to censor American social media platforms and American citizens. The Stanford Cyberpolicy Center was home to the fake \u201cresearchers\u201d who oversaw the DHS censorship-by-proxy effort from 2020 to 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Moreover, the EU is now in direct violation of the NATO Treaty, under which the US is militarily obligated to defend Europe.</strong> The NATO Treaty requires member states to have free speech and free and fair elections. France and Germany are actively and illegally preventing political candidates from running for office for ideological reasons, namely their opposition to mass migration. And the Romanian high court, with the support of the European Commission, nullified election results under the thin and unproven pretext of Russian interference, after a nationalist and populist presidential candidate won.</p>\n\n<p>The X fine comes in the wake of a renewed push for governments to break encryption and read private text messages, known as \u201cChat Control.\u201d The ostensible goal of this is to combat child abuse, and yet there is little evidence that such a system is needed. The heads of Signal and Telegram have strongly opposed the effort as a violation of privacy and a backdoor that others could exploit.</p>\n\n<p>And l<strong>ast month, the European Commission launched a \u201cDemocracy Shield\u201d program consisting of more funding for NGOs and \u201cfact checkers\u201d to \u201censure swift reactions to large-scale and potentially transnational information operations.</strong> An independent European Network of Fact-Checkers will be set up to boost fact-checking capacity in all EU official languages\u2026\u201d In the past, activist NGOs have demanded that social media companies censor content based on fact-checks, including false ones.</p>\n\n<p>The European Digital Services Act (DSA) rests upon a model of censorship by proxy. The proxies are NGOs, law enforcement organizations, and industry groups designated \u201cTrusted Flaggers.\u201d Noted Lorc\u00e1n Price of the Alliance Defending Freedom in his testimony to Congress in September of year, \u201cWhen a Trusted Flagger speaks, the service provider must listen and prioritize the review of the flagged content before that of its regular users. The service provider must review the flagged content to determine whether it violates the law of an EU member state or the EU itself. If so, the service provider must remove or disable access to the content.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Notably, the European Commission announced its X fine on the same day that the Trump administration released its new security strategy, which reads, \u201cWe will oppose elite-driven, anti-democratic restrictions on core liberties in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world, especially among our allies.\u201d The document implicitly threatens US commitment to military security for Europe. \u201cIt is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The European Constitution states that \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Why then is it now seeking to deny those rights?</p>\n\n<p><em>Please <a href=\"https://x.com/shellenberger/status/1997081936758820877\">subscribe now</a> to support Public's defense of free speech, read the full article, and watch the full video!</em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T10:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 05:00</span>\n",

In turn, it is <strong>superficially stable but steadily worsening living conditions, much more so than an outright crisis, that cause populations to rebel and to overthrow their ruling elites</strong>. The ruling elites of Europe know this, do not fancy being strung up on lampposts all over Europe, and seek to at least deflect the blame and, better yet, to engineer an outright crisis which they can then pretend to mitigate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Their manufactured crisis of choice is the entirely fictional yet imminent attack on the European Union by the Russian Federation</strong>. The risible lie used to support this argument is that should the Ukrainian army be routed and should the Kiev regime fall, Russian tanks will then roll across Europe... just like they did in 1945! The thorny question of why Russia would ever be interested in such an escapade is avoided through anti-Russian bigotry: the very fact that the Russians happen to be Russian is taken as sufficient to guarantee their propensity for such insane and self-defeating behavior.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But we, not being irrational anti-Russian bigots, will take the time to answer this question.</strong> Let us consider Russia's stated demands for the former Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic first created by Lenin and Stalin: its denazification, demilitarization, neutrality and guaranteeing the rights of the Russian-speaking majority (which remains a majority in spite of most heavy-handed official efforts to force people to speak Ukrainian). Note that \"conquering all of Europe\" or \"restoring the USSR\" is not on Russia's to-do list.</p>\n\n<p>Three years into Russia's Special Military Operation, we can consider the results.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Denazification:</strong> where are the Ukraine's neo-Nazi battalions which sported German Nazi-inspired flags and insignia and whose members were easily distinguished by swastikas and portraits of Hitler with which their limbs and torsos were tattooed? The ones regularly called out for the most war crimes are the Azov Battalion (now a regiment), the Aidar Battalion, the Kraken Regiment, and Right Sector. The Azov battalion was founded by far-right nationalist Andrey Biletsky, which used the Nazi Wolfsangel as its emblem. Pravy Sektor's ultranationalist members played a major role in the Euromaidan revolution of 2014 and in the war in the Donbas in 2014-2015. Aidar battalion was charged with human rights abuses by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Svoboda (Freedom) Party recruited fighters using ultranationalist and antisemitic rhetoric. All of them had a good run and caused much murder and mayhem, but by now much of their initial membership is dead, and although their names are still being used for propaganda purposes by the Kiev regime, the organizations themselves are half-dead. At this point, the Nazi battalions are mostly being used as barrier troops, blocking the raw recruits thrown at the advancing Russians from retreating and trying to kill them when they try to surrender.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Demilitarization</strong>: for the first year or so of the Special Military Operation, the Ukrainian forces had no shortage of volunteers, but now there are none. Instead, men are being grabbed off the streets and press-ganged into service (unless they can afford to pay a hefty bribe) while recruitment officers have become filthy rich and universally loathed and despised. Initially, Ukrainian troops were armed with Soviet-era weapons, left over from Ukrainian SSR, or scrounged from all over Eastern Europe by formerly Warsaw pact but now NATO-member countries. The Ukrainian military was organized and operated in accordance with Soviet-era field manuals and rule-books. And it posed a formidable threat and inflicted considerable casualties on the Russian side. The Soviet-vintage weapons supply was gradually depleted and replaced with NATO weapons, which proved much less effective and far easier for the Russians to destroy, designed, as they are, to maximize profits for American defense contractors rather than to provide adequate defense (since nobody is attacking America in any case). The NATO armories are by now substantially depleted as well, as are the funds available to procure more weapons. European leaders in Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia and elsewhere are starting to reject the idea of further military spending on behalf of the Kiev regime.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, back in the Ukraine, Soviet-era manuals and rule-books were replaced with \"NATO standards\" and training, which proved to be far less effective than the Soviet ones.</strong> NATO members learned the methodology from the Americans, who, in turn, learned it from former Nazi German officers, who, if you will recall, lost the war to the Red Army. NATO, and now the Ukrainian army, are thus reliant on military doctrines, organizational principles and operational practices of the losing side. NATO, which is mostly just the Americans, was able to achieve results (though never quite an outright victory) against such weak adversaries as Serbia and Libya, but its favorite technique \u2014 indiscriminate bombing campaigns \u2014would have inevitably escalated to a nuclear exchange if it were ever attempted against Russia.</p>\n\n<p>A truly ridiculous situation has emerged: the Ukrainians, role-playing as Nazi Germans, with NATO in a support role, is involved in a high-intensity conventional conflict with Russia, role-playing as the Red Army, and achieving the same end result. Since this implies extreme stupidity, a quick look at national IQ ratings seems warranted: Russia's average is 103; the Ukraine's is at 95.4 \u2014 the lowest in Europe. The US does a bit better with an IQ of 99.7 \u2014 still very far behind China's 107. \"Dumb and Dumber go to War\" would have made a good movie title, if it weren't for all the blood and the gore and the Ukrainian military graves stretching beyond the horizon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From all of this, it is possible to draw the conclusion that Russia is, slowly but surely, succeeding in the stated goals of its SMO by winning a war of attrition against both the Ukraine (in manpower) and NATO (in weapons).</strong> With the Ukrainian ultranationalists mostly dead and the Ukrainian and NATO armories depleted, and more and more Ukrainian soldiers refusing to fight, the military operation will inevitably draw to a close, the Kiev regime will fall, the Russian-speaking majority in the Ukraine will reassert its rights and, if all goes well, there will be a return to constitutional order which was destroyed during the US-organized putsch in the spring of 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Will Russia then go on to more Special Military Operations to denazify, demilitarize and defend the human rights of large Russian minorities living in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Moldova? <strong>Russia is treating the plight of the Russians still living in these parts as a humanitarian rather than a military issue, easily absorbing the influx.</strong> For instance, there is half a million Moldovans now living in Russia while the total population of Moldova is now just two million and falling fast. The picture for the Baltics is similar, although the numbers are too small to matter.</p>\n\n<p>But each of these semi-defunct former Soviet Socialist Republics, lovingly crafted out of bits of the Russian Empire and nurtured by internationalist-minded Bolsheviks to Russia's lasting regret and chagrin, also has certain strategic considerations for Russia: Estonia, together with Finland, almost blocks the Gulf of Finland which provides critically important sea access to St. Petersburg and the nearby ports of Ust-Luga and Primorsk with a total cargo volume of around 170 million tonnes per year. Lithuania provides a land bridge to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Moldova has a separatist region of Transnistria, inhabited by half a million actual Russian passport-holders whom the Russian state is theoretically sworn to defend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But which of these issues would Russia ever attempt to solve by going on attack? </strong>A less than completely insane, deranged Europe should be able to resolve such issues amicably and without recourse to violence. We can only hope that a resounding NATO defeat in the Ukraine will cool the NATO-heads who are currently seeking to escalate the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>If a military conflict involving the four countries mentioned above were to erupt, it is important to keep in mind that they would have to be defended by troops from elsewhere in Europe. <em><strong>All four of these countries are largely emptied of young people: since there are hardly any jobs there, young people leave as soon as they can, leaving behind countries sparsely populated by increasingly destitute pensioners, with more and more empty school buildings being converted to care for the old who can no longer take care of themselves.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>In turn, how likely is it that American, British, French, German, Spanish and Italian youths can be drafted and sent to die in a futile conflict to defend Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania (NATO and EU members) and Moldova (not)? If just 16% of German men say that they would definitely be willing to take up arms to defend their own Fatherland, then what percentage of them would be willing to go and die for Lithuania? We can only guess, so let us guess 2% \u2014 and these would be the mentally defective, suicidal ones! We can also hope that a less than utterly insane German society would generate considerable political pressure to force their government to just give the Russians whatever they want, which isn't much: open and secure highway and railway corridors to Kaliningrad and widened sea lanes and air corridors through the Gulf of Finland is all it would take to resolve the issue amicably as far as the Baltics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Currently, however, there seems to be no interest in the West in resolving issues amicably, instead concentrating on staging provocations.</strong> On September 10, some number of drones entered Polish airspace. These were subsequently discovered to be Russian-made Gerbera drones \u2014decoys which lack an explosive charge and are used to confuse and to deplete air defense systems. Based on their limited range, they were launched from Kiev regime-held territory. They overflew part of Belarus, where some of them were shot down, while others continued on to Poland. Belarus authorities issued a warning to their Polish counterparts: \"Incoming, watch out!\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Polish and other NATO forces scrambled jets \u2014 but jets are useless for shooting down such small and slow-moving targets. </strong>The drones were Russian-made but there is no evidence that they were Russian-operated. Such drones regularly fall out of the skies in the Ukraine and can be patched up, refueled, reprogrammed and sent on. It is possible that the Russians were behind the provocation if their goal was to demonstrate that NATO is defenseless against even such primitive drones, in which case they did prove their point, but it is far more likely that it was the Kiev regime trying to keep the \"Russian aggression\" narrative alive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Such plausibly deniable demonstrations do seem to take place.</strong> For example, there was the Chinese weather balloon which overflew continental United States from January 28 to February 4, 2023. Its flight path was a beautiful arc covering Alaska, Western Canada and then the contiguous United States from Washington State to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. It flew too high for the US Air Force to shoot down but it gradually lost altitude and was shot down by an F-22 Raptor at an altitude of 18,000 meters. It was either an accident (the balloon blown off-course) or a demonstration of the Americans' inability to defend their airspace against... weather balloons!</p>\n\n<p>Just 10 days after the episode featuring unarmed Russian drones flying unhindered over Poland, there followed a scandal with Russian jets supposedly violating Estonian airspace. According to the Estonians, three Russian Mig-31 jets entered Estonian airspace \"without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes.\" The jets were on their way from Leningrad region to Kaliningrad region, following the air corridors over the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic which are frequented by air traffic between these two Russian regions and which circumvent the three Baltic countries. In particular, the international free passage corridor between Finland and Estonia is 370km long but only 11km wide and it is theoretically possible that the Migs strayed over the southern, Estonian edge of it. In any case, Mig-31s cruise at 2,500km/h, or 41km/min, and in 12 minutes would have covered 491km, overshooting the mark by some 122km. Essentially, there isn't enough Estonian territory for them to have taken that long.</p>\n\n<p>The Estonian side failed to present any evidence of such a transgression while Russia's defense ministry said that the jets were on a \"scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states, as confirmed by objective monitoring\". That should have been the end of it, but noooo! Was it worth scrambling jets and calling an emergency NATO conference in accordance with Chapter 4 of the NATO charter over such a nonevent, be it intentional, accidental or fictional? Only if the intent was to create much ado about nothing and a tempest in a teacup.</p>\n\n<p>Zooming out from the particulars, such provocations are necessary: <em><strong>the transition from the now defunct Green New Deal to the new Brown New Deal \u2014 European militarism, that is \u2014 requires an enemy</strong></em>. There are just no other candidates: North Korea is too hot to touch; Iran, if sufficiently provoked, would destroy Israel; and China already has the European and the American economies in a submission hold and will choke out the round-eyes if they don't start to behave. The only safe enemy is Russia, but that is also a problem: Russia is not sufficiently threatening. It is therefore necessary to stage provocations in order to keep the myth of \"Russian aggression\" alive in the minds of Europeans, in the hopes of convincing, and, failing that, coercing them into accepting high levels of defense expenditure, just as they accepted high levels of spending on \"green\" energy \u2014 for the European ruling elites to pocket.</p>\n\n<p>However, it turns out that halfhearted provocations are hardly enough to keep the myth of \"Russian aggression\" alive, never mind making it sufficiently compelling to motivate scores of true believers to queue up at recruitment centers, eager to die battling aggressive Russians Ukrainian style.<strong> Luckily, barely believable provocations are not all that the collective West has to offer: there are also efforts being made at constructing a compelling image of the enemy. </strong>These efforts are quite extensive and intricate and have been in the works for centuries. They include a fanciful rewriting of history that consigns to oblivion all the episodes that fail to portray Russia in an entirely negative light. We will take them up next.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T07:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 02:00</span>\n",

The WNBA is in the thick of labor talks these days: The league and players\u2019 union recently agreed to extend their collective bargaining negotiating period through January. Collier\u2019s sport is undergoing its own economic transformation. Amid a women\u2019s basketball boom, WNBA team prices have skyrocketed, and the league\u2019s new media rights deal is valued at a figure six times the old one.

In Collier\u2019s telling, commissioner Cathy Engelbert is a poor steward for the moment, a leader who takes the WNBA\u2019s talent for granted. \u201cThe league believes it succeeds despite its players, not because of them,\u201d Collier said, adding later that \u201cthe best players in the world\u201d had \u201cthe worst leadership in the world.\u201d The measure she took was public and not so lurid a confrontation as Harper\u2019s\u2014no baseball bats involved. But the basic idea was the same: to establish whose clubhouse it really is.\n\nFor an emblem of player-commissioner relations in the NFL today, the New York Times reporter Ken Belson writes, look to the \u201cRoger Goodell Bro Hug.\u201d Every spring, the newest first-round picks bound across the NFL draft stage and wrap their arms around the commissioner. Sometimes they lift him off his feet. A hug Goodell shared with Baltimore Ravens draftee Malaki Starks this past April lasted 21 seconds. Speaking to Belson, an agent laments the annual show of affection for management, though he can\u2019t help but admire the bleak triumph it signals: \u201cYou have to give kudos to the NFL for making it that way.\u201d\n\nBelson\u2019s new book, Every Day Is Sunday: How Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, and Roger Goodell Turned the NFL into a Cultural & Economic Juggernaut, is a sobering account of how the NFL made the world this way, its way, totally in its image. Today, the football fan wakes to kickoffs in London and Berlin; she dozes off to the drawl of Cris Collinsworth, whose network pays $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Night Football. In 2024, NFL games accounted for 72 of the 100 highest-rated broadcasts on American TV. The year before, without the election and Olympics to account for, that number was 93.\n\nNFL revenues have more than tripled since Belson began covering the league's inner workings in 2013. Since then, the NFL has glided through obstacles: damning concussion research, increased attention on players arrested for domestic violence, high-profile player protests, tawdry owner scandals, the rise of streaming services, and overtures from private equity. In the book\u2019s acknowledgements, Belson recalls his Times editor\u2019s early mandate to cover the NFL \u201cas a really, really big business.\u201d Off the field were the real stories. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not at whatever folks consider to be the \u2018big game\u2019 of the week.\u201d\n\nThe Goodell presented in Every Day Is Sunday might be flattered by that kind of attention. At a 2010 meeting, he presented owners with a then-unthinkable financial target, to grow league revenue from $8 billion to $25 billion by 2027. In doing so, Goodell set his sights far beyond the little Sports Tuesday section on B8. \u201cRoger doesn\u2019t view the other leagues as competition,\u201d an NFL staffer tells Belson. \u201cHe wants to be mentioned with Disney and the Vatican, these massive institutions.\u201d Now in his 20th season as commissioner, Goodell has won his bosses gobs of money with what Belson paints as both political savvy and quiet ambition. The $25 billion vision will indeed come to pass in a couple of years, but the prophet won\u2019t be satisfied. When a friend emailed him the stat about 93 of 100 broadcasts, Goodell replied, \u201cWe have a couple of more spots to fill!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a story to read in the book\u2019s negative space: If Goodell, Kraft, and Jones have built the NFL as we know it now, it\u2019s been built almost entirely on ownership\u2019s terms. When they are drawn at all, the lines between labor and management are quickly smudged by a slick league PR apparatus. Rarely these days are the lines drawn by the sport\u2019s most prominent players. (Per the book\u2019s index, Magary, Drew is mentioned once, the same number of times as Mahomes, Patrick.)\n\nGoodell became commissioner in 2006, months after the NFL signed a CBA granting players 52 percent of league revenue after deductions. Owners quickly soured on the split. (\u201cA mean mother,\u201d Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called it.) In 2008, they exercised an opt-out clause to shorten the deal by a year. The 2011 lockout that followed marked the start of a prolonged\u2014and maybe still active\u2014period of backlash. For enduring labor\u2019s brief edge, the billionaires were owed reparations. As then-Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson put it at a 2010 owners meeting, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stick together and take back our league.\u201d That phrase, \u201cour league,\u201d confirms a suspicion voiced in the book by Jeff Saturday, a lead NFLPA player rep at the time: \u201cI feel like at times Jerry [Richardson] felt like the owners had created this thing as opposed to the other way around.\u201d The eventual 2011 deal reduced players' share of league revenue to 47 percent. Saturday and Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, christened the end of the lockout with a hug.\n\nRob Carr/Getty Images\n\nEvery Day Is Sunday brought to mind John Helyar\u2019s 1994 classic Lords of the Realm, a dishy history of labor wins in baseball. (Come back! It\u2019s interesting! I swear!) Helyar finds an easy hero in the union boss Marvin Miller, whose gift for \u201cconsciousness-raising\u201d made the MLBPA the gold standard. Miller turned \u201ccompliant peons to budding rebels\u201d with a message so simple and eternal that today a raw milk-drinking, de-blooded, re-blooded red-ass superstar slugger getting Wobbly just scans as basic gene expression. \u201cYou are the game,\u201d Miller told the players. \u201cWithout you there is no game.\u201d That spirit won MLB players free agency, better pensions, and the right to salary arbitration. Bit by bit, they clawed power away from \u201cthe Lords.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, these two books tell opposite stories, but it might be truer to call them different parts of the same story. In Belson\u2019s sequel\u2014spoiler!\u2014the Lords strike back. A chapter on the 2017 player protests is both instructive and nauseating as a peek into the NFL's corporate machinery. After players knelt during the national anthem in protest of police brutality, Goodell arranged a meeting between players and owners. One of the players was Anquan Boldin, whose goals here were not particularly lofty. Before the meeting, he told Goodell he wanted the owners to join the players in calling for legislative reform. \u201cIf an owner or the commissioner goes into a meeting with me, the conversation changes from a photo op to talking about true issues,\u201d he said.\n\nBoldin repeated this wish to owners in the meeting, a recording of which was sent to Belson:\n\nLater in the meeting, Boldin was more direct. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018players are being militant,\u2019 we\u2019re looked at as villains,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can have owners come and say, nationally, that no, they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re Americans, they care about the cities they\u2019re in, they care about these issues, we care about these issues, we\u2019re behind them, we\u2019re gonna educate ourselves about these issues, and we\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re gonna push forward. That changes us as a nation.\u201d\n\nAny genuine desires Boldin and the players voiced in that meeting would re-emerge from a Park Avenue boardroom as the Inspire Change initiative. Everyone was allowed to write \u201cEnd Racism\u201d on their cleats. Tension bubbled up again the next year, when owners pushed to officially mandate standing for the anthem. But that story ends tidily, with Kraft recruiting Jay-Z to produce the Super Bowl halftime show. It ends also with an amendment to the NFL game operations manual: \u201cAll teams and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and anthem.\u201d Earlier this year, the \u201cEnd Racism\u201d messaging was quietly scrapped.\n\nInterviewed for Ben Lindbergh\u2019s Lords of the Realm retrospective at The Ringer in 2019, Helyar noted a recent \u201ccreep toward owners\u201d in baseball. Belson\u2019s book warns that labor peace only means it\u2019s time to get back on defense. That can be hard in sports, where the labor force is trained to take things one game at a time. Owners like to leverage the brevity of most athletic careers to paint the real fight as one among labor, imagined between stars and scrubs. In an Atlanta Braves investor call this past June, Manfred copped to the clubhouse tour strategy: \u201cI usually try to avoid the high-earning guy at this point and find a younger player and say, \u2018Look, if you\u2019re one of the 10 percent, it\u2019s a great deal. But if you\u2019re the other 90, it ain\u2019t so good.\u2019\u201d Collier, an MVP candidate who co-founded the offseason league Unrivaled, has been charged with having a conflict of interest that would make her less sensitive to (or even the beneficiary of) a WNBA lockout.\n\nWhy do Kraft, Jones, and Goodell win so much? One trait they share is a stubborn belief in their own permanence. If Jones should ever die, visitors to the Dallas Cowboys' stadium may see him live on in hologram form; AI Jerry pops up at the end of the \u201cOwners Experience Tour.\u201d Kraft and Jones both star in multi-part docu-hagiographies, available to stream. Even in their eighties, neither owner speaks much of succession, and friends of Goodell\u2019s say they have never heard him mention retirement either. Every day is Sunday, and it will be forever.\n\nMiller asked players to think on exactly these terms, to remember that their cause transcends any one life or contract. \u201cThis could be my last year in baseball, and if the strike lasts the entire season and I\u2019ve played my last game, well, it will be painful,\u201d Giants player rep Willie Mays tells his fellow reps in a union meeting in Lords of the Realm, during the 1972 strike. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t hang together, everything we\u2019ve worked for will be lost.\u201d There\u2019s another means of immortality, not the hologram or the docuseries, just the simple vow to keep an eye out for someone else so they can one day do the same. When he signed a record contract with the New York Yankees in 2019, ace Gerrit Cole thanked Curt Flood and Miller, labor heroes he\u2019d first learned about from a veteran teammate in Pittsburgh. Of particular concern to Collier, she said in her press conference, were the underpaid stars coming up in the league, the ones four or five years younger. Harper has already signed the last big contract he will ever sign. We\u2019ll all die one day, but there\u2019s still some part to play, some piece of the fight to wage. You can hug it out, or you can pick up a bat.",

    "full_content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2013 Ukrainian officials were expected to hand their latest peace proposals to United States negotiators Wednesday, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who also said Ukraine would be ready for elections within three months if partners can guarantee a safe vote during wartime and if its electoral law can be altered.\n\nZelenskyy was responding to comments by U.S. President Donald Trump in which he questioned Ukraine\u00b4s democracy and suggested the Ukrainian leader was using the war as an excuse not to hold an election.\n\nZelenskyy told reporters late Tuesday that he is \u201cready\u201d for an election but would need help from the U.S. and possibly Europe to ensure security for a vote to happen. He suggested that Ukraine could be ready to hold balloting in 60 to 90 days if that proviso is met.\n\n\u201cTo hold elections, two issues must be addressed: primarily, security \u2013 how to conduct them, how to do it under strikes, under missile attacks; and a question regarding our military \u2013 how they would vote,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\n\u201cAnd the second issue is the legislative framework required to ensure the legitimacy of elections,\u201d he said.\n\nPreviously, Zelenskyy had pointed out that a ballot can\u2019t legally take place while martial law imposed due to Russia\u2019s invasion nearly four years ago is in place. He has also asked how a vote could happen when civilian areas of Ukraine are being bombarded by Russia and almost 20% of the country is under Russian occupation.\n\nZelenskyy said he has asked lawmakers from his party in Parliament to draw up legislative proposals that would allow elections while Ukraine is under martial law.\n\nUkrainians have on the whole supported Zelenskyy\u2019s arguments, and there has been no clamor in Ukraine for an election. Under the Ukrainian law that is in force, Zelenskyy\u00b4s rule is legitimate.\n\nBut with Trump pressing hard for a deal between Kyiv and Moscow, Zelenskyy is walking a tightrope between defending Ukrainian interests and showing the American president that he is willing to make some compromises.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly complained that Zelenskyy can\u2019t legitimately negotiate a peace settlement because his five-year term in office that began in 2019 has expired.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an important time to hold an election. They\u2019re using war not to hold an election,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Politico, echoing Moscow\u2019s stance.\n\nA new U.S. national security strategy released last Friday made it clear that Trump wants to improve America\u00b4s relationship with Moscow and \u201creestablish strategic stability with Russia.\u201d\n\nThe document also portrays European allies as weak.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday praised Trump\u2019s role in the Ukraine peace effort, saying in a speech at the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia\u2019s Parliament, that Moscow appreciates his \u201ccommitment to dialogue.\u201d Trump, Lavrov said, is \u201cthe only Western leader\u201d who shows \u201can understanding of the reasons that made war in Ukraine inevitable.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s decisions are likely to be pivotal for Ukraine, Washington\u2019s peace efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nTrump\u2019s initial peace proposal was heavily slanted toward Russia\u2019s demands. To counter that, Zelenskyy has turned to his European supporters.\n\nIn recent days, Zelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nZelenskyy said three documents were being discussed with American and European partners \u2013 a 20-point framework document that is constantly changing, a document on security guarantees, and a document about Ukraine\u2019s recovery.\n\nEurope\u2019s support is uneven, however, and that has meant a drop-off in military aid since the Trump administration this year cut off supplies to Kyiv unless they were paid for by other NATO countries.\n\nForeign military help for Ukraine fell sharply over the summer, and that trend continued through September and October, a German body that tracks international help for Ukraine said Wednesday.\n\nAverage annual aid, mostly provided by the U.S. and Europe, was around 41.6 euros billion ($48.4 billion) between 2022-2024. But so far this year Ukraine has received just 32.5 billion euros ($37.8 billion), the Kiel Institute said.\n\n\u201cIf this slower pace continues in the remaining months (of the year), 2025 will become the year with the lowest level of new aid allocations\u201d since the war began, it said.\n\nThis year, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have substantially increased their help for Ukraine, while Germany nearly tripled its average monthly allocations and France and the U.K. both more than doubled their contributions, according to the Kiel Institute.\n\nOn the other hand, it said, Spain recorded no new military aid for Kyiv in 2025 while Italy reduced its low contributions by 15% compared with 2022-2024.",

That was the joint response from Muslim-majority Egypt and Iran, two Middle East nations where homosexuality is illegal, venting their fury Tuesday that FIFA has scheduled a 2026 World Cup soccer match in Seattle that overlaps LGBTQI+ Pride events.\n\nThe fixture on June 26 next year has been designated by local organisers as a \u201cPride Match\u201d to coincide with Seattle\u2019s Pride weekend, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nEgypt and Iran are now furiously protesting because that cause affronts their Islamic sensibilities alongside \u201cthe cultural and social values\u201d they hold.\n\nEgypt\u2019s soccer federation issued a statement late Tuesday saying it sent a letter to FIFA \u201ccategorically rejecting any activities related to supporting homosexuality during the match.\u201d\n\nSeattle PrideFest has been organized in the city since 2007 by a nonprofit which designated the June 26 game for celebration before FIFA made the World Cup draw Friday, AP reports.\n\nFIFA chose Saturday to allocate the Egypt-Iran game to Seattle instead of Vancouver, where the teams\u2019 group rivals Belgium and New Zealand will play at the same time.\n\n\u201cWith matches on Juneteenth and pride, we get to show the world that in Seattle, everyone is welcome,\u201d Seattle\u2019s Mayor-elect Kate Wilson wrote on social media. \u201cWhat an incredible honor!\u201d\n\nThe AP report notes FIFA controls only stadiums and official fan zones in World Cup host cities and should have no formal authority over community events like Seattle PrideFest.\n\nIn Iran, where gays and lesbians can face the death penalty, the president of Iran\u2019s Football Federation Mehdi Taj attacked the match during an interview aired on state television.\n\nTaj said Iran would bring up the issue during a FIFA Council meeting in Qatar next week. The longest-serving member of the 37-person council chaired by FIFA President Gianni Infantino is Egypt\u2019s Hany Abo Rida.\n\n\u201cBoth Egypt and we have objected, because this is an unreasonable and illogical move that essentially signals support for a particular group, and we must definitely address this point,\u201d Taj said. State TV on Tuesday confirmed a complaint would be sent to FIFA.\n\nThe Egypt soccer federation led by Ado Rida said of the pride events it \u201ccompletely rejects such activities, which directly contradict the cultural, religious and social values in the region, especially in Arab and Islamic societies.\u201d\n\nThe 2026 World Cup is set to be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026.\n\nRead the AP report in full here",

    "content": "<p>CNN is on the brink of having yet another new owner and, as of this moment, it's anyone's guess as to who it'll be.</p><p>In October, CNN's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was putting itself up for sale. It previously said it was going to split into two companies \u2014 one for the studio and HBO, the other being the cable networks currently within the corporate umbrella.</p><p>Before Netflix emerged last week as the victor of the bidding war, it had seemed that Paramount owner David Ellison was in the driver's seat, only to be off-roaded by the streaming giant on Friday with its nearly $83 billion offer. On Monday, Paramount launched a $108 billion hostile takeover bid for the entire company, including its cable assets like CNN.</p><p>\"I think there is a very small contingent who wants Paramount... most do not,\" one CNN staffer told <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox News Digital</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/paramount-launches-hostile-takeover-bid-warner-bros-discovery-says-offer-superior-netflix-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>PARAMOUNT LAUNCHES HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID OF WARNER BROS DISCOVERY, SAYS OFFER IS \u2018SUPERIOR\u2019 TO NETFLIX DEAL</u></strong></a></p><p>Leading up to the corporate drama that has unfolded in recent days, CNN's rank and file were not exactly leaping for joy about the prospects of Ellison becoming their new boss.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t think most like it because they fear him meddling,\" the CNN staffer said of Ellison.</p><p>A second CNN staffer noted the \"grim\" mood within the newsroom regarding Ellison.</p><p>\"They see CBS as a complete and utter s--- show, which it was before this to be honest,\" the CNN staffer told Fox News Digital, while conceding \"our organization is also in chaos and crisis.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/trump-warns-netflix-warner-bros-discovery-deal-could-problem-says-hell-involved-decision\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP WARNS NETFLIX-WARNER BROS DISCOVERY DEAL COULD BE A PROBLEM, SAYS HE'LL BE \u2018INVOLVED\u2019 IN DECISION</strong></a></p><p>In August, Ellison took over Paramount as part of its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The deal was plagued by politics as Paramount settled President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump</a>'s election interference lawsuit against the company over CBS News' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kamala Harris</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Liberal critics accused Paramount of \"bending the knee\" to Trump in order for his FCC to approve the merger. They also expressed outrage over <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-cancels-the-late-show-stephen-colbert-end-program-may-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CBS' cancellation</a> of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" which will stop airing after May 2026. The network insisted it was purely a financial decision, though critics believe it was also tied to the FCC-approved merger.\u00a0</p><p>CBS News, the perpetual third place broadcaster behind ABC News and NBC News' weekday programming, has undergone some major changes in Ellison's first few months as its owner, from implementing a brutal round of layoffs, tapping Bari Weiss as the network's editor-in-chief, to pushing out \"CBS Evening News\" anchors John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois. Weiss is reportedly eying \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil to take the chair.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/senate-gears-up-intense-antitrust-hearing-wake-netflix-warner-bros-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>SENATE GEARS UP FOR 'INTENSE' ANTITRUST HEARING IN WAKE OF NETFLIX, WARNER BROS DEAL</u></strong></a></p><p>CNN staffers fear that the editorial reshaping of CBS News by Ellison and Weiss would impact their own newsroom if Paramount buys Warner Bros. Discovery. They also worry about a potential \"bloodbath\" among leadership if CBS News and CNN were to merge.\u00a0</p><p>\"They like editorial independence, and I think the reports of what CBS has gone through suggests that may not be the case where there to be a Paramount takeover,\" the first CNN staffer said.</p><p>During a CNBC interview on Monday, Ellison was asked whether he would combine CNN and CBS News' newsgathering operations. He dodged the question, speaking instead about the broader goal he has for news, which is getting into the \"trust\" and \"truth business\" that \"speaks to the 70% of Americans in the middle,\" a sentiment previously echoed by Weiss.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bari-weiss-reportedly-stunned-60-minutes-crew-asking-why-country-thinks-theyre-biased-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>BARI WEISS REPORTEDLY 'STUNNED' '60 MINUTES' CREW BY ASKING WHY THE COUNTRY THINKS THEY'RE 'BIASED': REPORT</strong></a></p><p>However, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-netflix-warner-bros-battle-ellisons-a86fe15c?st=6zkB6m&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">reported</a> that Ellison had told Trump officials that he'd make sweeping changes to CNN if he became its owner, and that Trump has been vocal about wanting CNN to have new ownership that will make programming changes.</p><p>\"I think everyone wants to be fair,\" the CNN staffer said. \"I don't think [CNN colleagues] see Ellison as trying to target the political middle. I think they think he is kowtowing to Trump.\"</p><p>Trump himself has so far had a more agnostic approach to the bidding war despite his reported coziness with Ellison and his billionaire father Larry Ellison. Last week, he praised Netflix as a \"great company\" and called its CEO Ted Sarandos a \"fantastic man\" but expressed concern about its market share. On Monday, he refrained from saying he supported Paramount's bid despite it being partially financed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner's private equity firm Affinity Partners, something Trump told reporters he hadn't discussed with Kushner about.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-unloads-cbs-60-minutes-over-marjorie-taylor-greenes-interview-demands-apology-rips-ownership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blasted Paramount</a> over the \"60 Minutes\" interview featuring ally-turned-foe Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., writing on Truth Social that the new ownership is \"NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.\"</p><p>CNN has repeatedly been orphaned by corporate parents for years, from Time Warner in the 90s, to AOL in the early 2000s, to AT&amp;T in 2018, leading to its 2022 spinoff of Warner Bros. Discovery, led by CEO David Zaslav.</p><p>\"I remember when AT&amp;T was seen as horrific. Looking back, it\u2019s the best owner we\u2019ve had in a decade,\" the second CNN staffer said. \"They left us alone. That\u2019s all any news organization wants. They plowed money into us. And yeah, Zaslav dumped CNN+\u00a0on like the second day or whatever. But AT&amp;T put in 600 million bucks.\"</p><p>Not everyone at CNN is hitting the panic button on Ellison. The second staffer told Fox News Digital that they'll be \"open-minded\" if he takes over. The staffer also called Weiss \"very thoughtful and very confident,\" which could be a \"very good combo.\"</p><p>\"I hope I'll be pleasantly surprised,\" they said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-snags-abc-reporter-who-apologized-remarks-about-charlie-kirk-shooters-touching-messages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CBS SNAGS ABC REPORTER WHO APOLOGIZED FOR REMARKS ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK'S ALLEGED SHOOTER'S 'TOUCHING' MESSAGES</strong></a></p><p>A third CNN staffer suggested that Paramount buying the network would be the better outcome versus being spun off if Netflix buys Warner Bros. and being \"totally chopped to pieces and whittled to the bone private equity style.\"</p><p>Regardless, the agony of CNN's unknown future is only fueling anxiety in the newsroom.</p><p>\"Most people have no idea what will happen... The uncertainty is the worst of all,\" the first CNN staffer said.</p><p>Representatives for CNN and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. A spokesperson for Paramount declined to comment.\u00a0</p>",

    "content": "<p>As he's done so many times, Buffalo Bills MVP quarterback <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/josh-allen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Josh Allen</a> scrambled outside the pocket on a snowy Highmark Stadium turf, surveying the field through flurries while defenders were crashing down on him.\u00a0</p><p>It was a 14-3 game in favor of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-burrow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joe Burrow</a> and the Cincinnati Bengals, a game in which the Bills needed to win to keep their AFC East division hopes alive, while maintaining a strong playoff case. So, as Allen does, he finds a way to get the job done despite the circumstances.\u00a0</p><p>Somehow, some way, he noticed his trusty receiver, Khalil Shakir, dashing around the end zone on fourth-and-4 from the Cincinnati 11-yard line. But anyone in Western New York, and watching at home, wouldn't have batted an eye if Allen didn't throw a pass to the No. 10 jersey he saw streaking through Bengals secondary personnel \u2013 why risk a turnover?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href=\"http://FOXNEWS.COM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Not Allen, though. With a rifle for an arm and confidence that always seemed to be bigger than the moment itself, he threw a seed to Shakir, hitting him between the numbers for a much-needed Bills touchdown in the second quarter.\u00a0</p><p>Surprised? Shakir isn't at this point of his career.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think he\u2019s done it so much that I am just used to it,\" Shakir smiled as he told Fox News Digital about his fourth touchdown of the season, while also highlighting his partnership with Kelley Blue Book.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/super-bowl-lix-star-quarterbacks-struggle-crucial-point-2025-season\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SUPER BOWL LIX STAR QUARTERBACKS STRUGGLE AT CRUCIAL POINT OF 2025 SEASON</strong></a></p><p>Whether it's his arm, legs, or preferably both, it seems Allen is making these highlight-reel plays each week for the Bills. After all, winning MVP means going above and beyond, and Allen has been the epitome of that for this franchise since he was taken in the first round in 2018.\u00a0</p><p>Shakir couldn't be more confident saying his quarterback is the best player in the NFL, but Allen will even tell you winning MVP, and a hopeful <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/super-bowl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Bowl</a> for his Bills, requires everyone to do their part.\u00a0</p><p>Shakir, who signed a four-year extension with the Bills in February, understands his role. Always expect the ball, even if you have multiple defenders around in snowy conditions while you're slipping and sliding on the turf.\u00a0</p><p>\"In those scramble-play moments, being a skill player on the field just to make yourself available for him as much as you can,\" Shakir explained. \"He\u2019s the best player in the entire league and has the ability to make these insane plays literally whenever he wants to. Knowing that he trusts us to make those catches, I think gives him comfort in making that type of throw.\"</p><p>Shakir was a fifth-round pick by the Bills out of Boise State in 2022, and last year saw his best production with 821 yards on 76 receptions (100 targets). He proved to be a reliable target for Allen, building that trust factor after tallying 611 yards on 39 grabs in 2023.</p><p>Trust is the only way plays like that on Sunday against the Bengals can work, and it\u2019s something Shakir takes pride in.</p><p>\"I had a shallow route and then tried to run to the sideline and it got blocked off, so I just started running up the field. Then, I\u2019m looking around and there\u2019s all these white jerseys around me and I turn and the ball\u2019s right there,\" he said about the touchdown.</p><p>\"The fact that Josh has the ability to put the ball wherever he wants to because he is that good, it\u2019s insane. So, like I\u2019ve said 1,000 times, it\u2019s an honor to share the field with him. He\u2019s amazing.\"</p><p>Allen will be leaning on Shakir and other pass catchers to get the job done these remaining four games to secure another chance at the franchise\u2019s first Super Bowl.</p><p>\"Being on the field with him, it\u2019s important that we get to where we need to be, the spots we need to be on certain plays because we know the ball\u2019s going to be on the money every single time,\" Shakir said about his quarterback.</p><p><strong>SMART MONEY MOVES</strong></p><p>It\u2019s every professional athlete\u2019s dream to get that second contract, which usually means big bucks coming into the bank account.</p><p>But Shakir knows that keeping the wealth is just as important as earning it. He did a fun campaign with Kelley Blue Book, the industry standard for vehicle valuations and ratings, as it highlights him still driving his 2021 Subaru despite his big extension.</p><p>Shakir is a practical guy, though, and with his wife, Sayler, and new baby girl, Sunny Haven, to look after off the field, he doesn\u2019t always need to flash his finances around.</p><p>\"It was something that aligned so perfectly because of how they do their research and how they make their informed decision,\" Shakir said when asked about his partnership with Kelley Blue Book. \"It\u2019s exactly the lifestyle I like to live and it meshed together with being financially smart with your money.\"</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s</strong></i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>\u00a0sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>\u00a0and subscribe to</strong></i><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>\u00a0the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

The news came following weeks of pressure over Andrew\u2019s relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\u00a0</p><p>Following the king\u2019s rare move \u2014 which came after years of scandal \u2014 the former Duke of York is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, not as a prince. He must also vacate his mansion near Windsor Castle.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/andrew-demands-new-six-bedroom-home-full-staff-forced-out-royal-lodge-experts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ANDREW DEMANDS NEW SIX-BEDROOM HOME WITH FULL STAFF AFTER BEING FORCED OUT OF ROYAL LODGE: EXPERTS</strong></a></p><p>\"Given Andrew\u2019s ghastly behavior, his still being in the line of succession is \u2026 embarrassing at best,\" <a href=\"https://hilaryfordwich.strelmark.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">British royals expert Hilary Fordwich</a> told Fox News Digital.</p><p>\"But in reality, he\u2019s so far down the line \u2014 behind the Sussex children \u2014 there\u2019s little risk of him ever becoming king. Nevertheless, there is concern that any ad hoc removal of unpopular royals could make the institution look more like a political machine than a stable hereditary monarchy.\"</p><p>As the second son of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/queen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, Andrew is eighth in line to the throne despite losing his titles, honors and public role. He was originally second in line when he was born.\u00a0</p><p><strong>WATCH: PRINCE ANDREW STRIPPED OF TITLES, EVICTED FROM ROYAL LODGE</strong></p><p>As Charles had both children and grandchildren, Andrew was pushed further down the order.

Several royal experts noted that Edward VIII, the late queen\u2019s uncle, lost his place when he abdicated in 1936.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>They also pointed out that Prince Michael of Kent was removed when he married a Catholic in 1978. He was reinstated with the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, which eliminated the automatic disqualification for marrying a Catholic.</p><p>Andrew <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/prince-andrew\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stepped back as a working royal</a> in 2019 after his disastrous BBC interview explaining his friendship with Epstein, who died that year in jail while facing sex-trafficking charges involving minors. Before she died in 2022, the queen stripped her son of his military titles and patronages.</p><p>Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Virginia Giuffre, an American woman who alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with the royal three times. The settlement, made for an undisclosed sum, included no admission of liability.</p><p>Giuffre, who died in April, alleged in previous legal filings that Epstein arranged for her to meet Andrew at age 17. Emails leaked in recent months also suggested Andrew was <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeffrey-epstein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in contact with Epstein</a> after claiming to have severed ties.</p><p>Andrew, 65, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>After months of political debate, Congress passed \u2014 and President Donald Trump signed \u2014 legislation compelling the Justice Department to release all files related to Epstein before Christmas, The Associated Press reported.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

Experts warned that new claims or allegations could still emerge, and a swift parliamentary move would send a message of accountability.</p><p>\"Removal from the line of succession would require complex legislation and consent from the Commonwealth realms, making it highly unlikely,\" Chard said. \"However, could public pressure force the symbolic removal of Andrew from the line of succession? Andrew could be removed if found guilty of misconduct.\"</p><p>\"King Charles has already asserted the royal prerogative as far as he can for now,\" Fordwich explained. \"He\u2019s used royal warrants and administrative changes to remove Andrew\u2019s titles and official roles, rebranding him simply as Mr. Andrew. He\u2019s also ousting him from Royal Lodge.\"</p><p>\"The existing legal framework of hereditary succession \u2014 as a blood descendant of Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 must be altered by Parliament and all Commonwealth realms,\" Fordwich noted. \"Andrew could also voluntarily abdicate his claim, but that\u2019s highly unlikely.\"</p><p>Fordwich added that there is a deliberate separation between hereditary right and court favor to prevent any one faction from wielding excessive power.</p><p>\"The system is designed so that a monarch can\u2019t simply erase on a whim any relatives from the line of succession for either personal or political reasons,\" said Fordwich. \"Historically, this has always been viewed as a rather sensible safeguard, ensuring constitutional stability.\"</p><p>Andrew\u2019s daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, still hold their titles as granddaughters of a sovereign. According to royal experts, the princesses are welcomed by the king to help support the monarchy with royal duties.</p><p>The former Duke of York is expected to move to a property on the king\u2019s Sandringham estate.

NY Post Design\n\n\u201cSwitching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department\u2019s official correspondence,\u201d Rubio wrote in an \u201caction request,\u201d obtained by Reuters and the New York Times.\n\nTimes New Roman has long been a classic letterhead in books, featuring narrower and more formally shaped letters relative to Calibri.\n\nThe State Department used Times New Roman as its official font starting in 2004, when it shifted away from Courier New, a typeface frequently used in screenplays with its monospaced letters.\n\nRubio reportedly dinged the Blinken-era switch to Calibri as \u201cwasteful\u201d and woke in his Dec. 9 cable to personnel.\n\n\u201cTo restore decorum and professionalism to the Department\u2019s written work products and abolish yet another wasteful DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility] program, the Department is returning to Times New Roman as its standard typeface,\u201d Rubio reportedly wrote.\n\n\u201cThis formatting standard aligns with the President\u2019s One Voice for America\u2019s Foreign Relations directive, underscoring the Department\u2019s responsibility to present a unified, professional voice in all communications.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the Blinken-era switch to Calibri, the State Department had pointed to studies suggesting the wider typeface was more readable for people with visual disabilities \u2014 a conclusion that has split experts.\n\nDuring President Trump\u2019s second term, his team has sought to scrap Biden-era diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies within the government and encourage the private sector to do the same.",

    "content": "I was just thinking about the decline of DVDs as a format for home theater. The Extras are something of a lost art by now, as a result. Then I remembered this time I discovered a really out-there deleted scene from Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/sgsj5rob5ype1.jpeg\n\n\nWe had this movie on DVD back in the day, and my brothers and I were dicking around with the extras after having finished watching the film itself. I don't know how well any of you remember your mid-aughts Rowan Atkinson movies, but towards the middle Mr. Bean has to hitchhike his way across France to get to the Cannes Film Festival, despite not speaking French. He's picked up by Sabine, the female lead, who assumes he's a Russian director or something. This is where the cut scene takes place. \n\nBasically, it's an extended sequence where, through an escalating series of misunderstandings, Sabine starts to question her career and her life's work, pulls the car over, and lays down on the street, screaming \"je veux mourir (I want to die)\". Now, you might be asking yourself \"isn't this a comedy movie?\", and you would be right. The whole affair is played for laughs. You see, it's the middle of the French countryside, so the highway doesn't have any other cars on it. Sabine is forced to wait until a vehicle in either direction shows up to end her misery. Mr. Bean, who has no clue what's happening, just bumbles around asking \"Cannes?\". Until a truck approaches, and he starts to panic. He unsuccessfully coaxes her to get off the street, and then she grabs onto his shoe, saying something about how they should die together(???). I don't even remember how this sequence ends, but in order for it to fit into the larger film, either they must have rewritten/reshot a bunch of stuff, or the intention was for them to get back in the car and never mention or acknowledge what happened ever again.\n\nHonestly, it's not hard to see why they cut this scene. I feel bad saying that because of all the work they put in, especially the actress, but it's overly long, it doesn't really suit the movie that it's in, it's in poor taste and highly inappropriate, and most damning of all: it just isn't very funny. \n\nStill, it's a wild and unexpected ride that I never would have experienced if I had just seen Mr. Bean's Holiday on some kind of streaming service. What was the most off-guard a DVD extra has ever caught you?\n\nEDIT: I found the scene on Youtube. If you're wondering how it ends, the scene just cuts right as the truck seemingly drives over Sabine. Guess we can consider it an alternate ending? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/WrxyOZYizd8?si=mOWoV_SPkkrFo7zE&amp;t=467",

You can give up pencils,\" <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/09/trump-affordability-pennsylvania/\">said</a> President Donald Trump at a speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, that was supposed to help alleviate people's worries about affordability and help Republicans figure out salient messaging ahead of the midterms.</p>\n<p>What a fascinating tack to take.</p>\n<p>\"You always need steel. You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter,\" he continued. \"Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls. So, we're doing things right. We're running this country right well.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that,\" said Trump. \"But they use the word affordability.<i>\u00a0</i>And that's the only word they say. Affordability. And that's their only word. They say, 'Affordability.' And everyone says, 'Oh, that must mean Trump has high prices.' No. Our prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country.\"</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, this is true: Inflation reached its <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/economy/cpi-inflation-june/index.html\">year-over-year high</a> in June 2022, during Joe Biden's presidency, when it broke 9 percent. It has since been tamed. But the Trump economy is rather, uh, bad. And it's unforced errors all the way down: Tariffs aren't necessary or wise or especially conservative (though <a href=\"https://x.com/carney/status/1998560873879843014?s=20\">he's worked on rebranding them</a> as such). The economic hardship imposed wipes out any revenue gains, and then some. \"The Trump tariffs amount to an average\u00a0<span class=\"glossary-term\"><a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax/\">tax</a><cite class=\"glossary-term-summary\"></cite></span> increase per US household of $1,100 in 2025 and $1,400 in 2026,\" <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/\">report</a> Tax Foundation's Erica York and Alex Durante. They continue, \"The Trump tariffs are the largest US tax increase as a percent of GDP (0.47 percent for 2025) since 1993.\" Many companies will choose not to do business in the U.S., and many U.S. businesses that relied on foreign imports will have to change their methods or simply shoulder higher costs that will inevitably be passed on to consumers. Some will just close up shop.</p>\n<p>Trump, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/09/trump-affordability-pennsylvania/\">in his Pennsylvania speech</a>, displays approximately zero self-awareness and shares no admissions of guilt: \"I mean, the only thing that is really going up big, it's called the stock market and your 401(k).\" But people aren't fools. They see the rise in grocery prices reflected in their household budgets; the fact that it's harder to get goods to arrive on time; the fact that large manufacturers are now running into real supply chain issues (after a summer and fall of stockpiling that made it so most consumers didn't feel the tariff effects until somewhat recently). Is the rhetorical approach of \"you can just give up things you want\" actually a winner? Trump seems to think so. Color me skeptical.</p>\n<p><strong>Social media surveillance for visa-free visitors:\u00a0</strong>U.S. Customs and Border Protection is <a href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-22461.pdf\">going to start</a> \"adding social media as a mandatory data element\" that they consider <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/us-plans-to-mandate-social-media-checks-for-visa-free-visitors?srnd=homepage-americas\">when screening people</a> entering the country under the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of places like Australia, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. to enter visa-free.</p>\n<p>This raises questions. Can you just pretend you don't have social media accounts? What exactly would they find disqualifying? Also, is this really the highest and best use of these agents' time? Attempting to very tightly control who enters this country would make sense if we had some sort of massive wave of radicalism and extremist violence fomented by people from these places who are entering via the Visa Waiver Program\u2014but we don't. We don't even have much of an issue with these passport holders overstaying their visas. Like so many things the Trump administration does, it's a solution in search of a problem.</p>\n<p>The new screening \"would apply to travelers from about 40 countries who can stay in the US for up to 90 days without a visa and are screened before travel under an electronic system known as ESTA,\" <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/us-plans-to-mandate-social-media-checks-for-visa-free-visitors?srnd=homepage-americas\">reports</a>\u00a0<em>Bloomberg.\u00a0</em>It's \"the latest in a series of measures from the Trump administration aimed at restricting entry,\" including \"<a class=\"media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/trump-to-expand-travel-ban-to-around-30-countries-after-shooting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-component=\"link\">a planned travel ban</a> for around 30 countries announced this month following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington.\" But the suspect in that shooting, keen observers might note, was not visiting from Germany or Australia; he was \"an Afghan national who worked with US forces and the CIA in Afghanistan before arriving in the US in 2021.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Scenes from New York:\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">the rapid rise of &quot;private members clubs&quot; in new york is a useful phenomena to watch. these clubs aren&#39;t &quot;private&quot; in any real sense, they simply exist to enforce norms (don&#39;t overhear people, don&#39;t photograph people, no fighting) that were enforced societally but are no longer <a href=\"https://t.co/rga8oHKfrb\">https://t.co/rga8oHKfrb</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Will Manidis (@WillManidis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillManidis/status/1995881329926262929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>QUICK HITS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>At long last, the <em>Reason</em> Webathon has concluded.

And warnings of the decline in test scores have been dramatically overstated.\" I have to lodge my disagreement with Cowen here: Maybe the concerns are more minor for children whose parents set controls and limits, but I'm very worried about attention-span bifurcation, in which some number of children have their attention spans safeguarded from a very young age in some form and other children have iPad <em>Cocomelon</em>-ed(or worse) <em>Clockwork Orange-</em>d into their eyeballs from the age of 12 months onward, thus hindering them from developing any semblance of focus.</li>\n<li>\"Over the past decade, a growing number of adolescents [in the Netherlands] have applied for assisted death for relief from irremediable psychiatric suffering from conditions such as eating disorders and anxiety,\" <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/09/science/medically-assisted-dying-laws.html\">reports</a>\u00a0<em>The New York Times.\u00a0</em>The Dutch government's decision to allow assisted suicide for minors is rather controversial, and \"public concern over a few high-profile cases of teens who received assisted deaths prompted the country's regulator to consider a moratorium on approvals for children applying on the basis of psychiatric suffering.\"</li>\n<li>\"Last month, <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/11/14/12th-grade-girls-are-less-likely-than-boys-to-say-they-want-to-get-married-someday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pew Research Center compared</a> data from 1993 and 2023, finding 12th-grade boys are more likely than 12th-grade girls to say they want to get married someday, a flip from three decades ago,\" <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/09/men-women-marriage/\">writes</a> Emily Jashinsky for <em>The Washington Post. </em>\"Boys' plans for marriage have barely budged since 1993, dropping to 74 percent from 76 percent.

If 6 in 10 girls still say they want to get married, what's going on with the two who changed their minds since 1993? A January paper summarized by the <a href=\"https://aibm.org/research/will-college-educated-women-find-someone-to-marry/\">American Institute for Boys and Men found</a>: 'Historical data show that when men's educational and economic outcomes decline, it is women without a college degree who experience the sharpest declines in marriage rates.'

    "content": "<p>From yesterday's decision by Texas Court of Appeals Justice Katy Boatman in <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/texas/fourteenth-court-of-appeals/2025-14-24-00828-cv.pdf?ts=1765287560\"><em>Daly v. Lehle</em></a>, joined by Justices Chad Bridges and Maritza Ant\u00fa:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This appeal matches pickleball against tennis&hellip;. Defendant served as chairwoman of the courts for the Coles Crossing community, looking after the interests of local tennis players and ensuring that the community's tennis courts were well-maintained. Defendant gave monthly reports at the Coles Crossing homeowners' association board meetings.</p>\n<p>Coles Crossing residents suggested the community install pickleball courts, so the HOA board set up an exploratory pickleball committee with members representing mixed interests: Plaintiff (team pickleball) was committee head and Defendant (team tennis) was one of several committee members. Things quickly soured, as the parties disagreed about the extent to which the tennis courts should be modified so they could double as pickleball courts.</p>\n<p>During this time, Defendant also permitted a local tennis professional to use the courts to teach tennis lessons to children from the community. According to Defendant, she \"received calls from at least four parents of clinic participants relaying serious concerns that an anonymous adult man was using his personal cell phone to take pictures of their young children doing drills on the tennis courts.\" Two HOA board members explained to Defendant that Plaintiff was taking the photographs to document HOA rules violations\u2014namely, allowing a tennis professional to use multiple courts simultaneously. Plaintiff said he also relayed the reason for his photographs to Defendant.</p>\n<p>Three months later, Defendant opened her monthly tennis report at the HOA board meeting by lobbing an accusation: she, \"as a former teacher,\" had a \"duty to report instances of sexual exploitation of minor children through photographs and videography.\" Defendant accused Plaintiff \"of taking photographs of children for inappropriate purposes\" and \"implied that [he] was a pervert, pedophile, or sexual predator.\" Multiple community members complained to the HOA board about Defendant's statements&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Plaintiff sued, and the court held the case could go forward:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360328\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>The TCPA [Texas Citizens Participation Act] aims to protect citizens who associate, petition, or speak on matters of public concern from retaliatory lawsuits that seek to intimidate or silence them. That protection comes in the form of a \"special motion to dismiss\" any suit that \"appears to stifle the defendant's exercise of those rights.\"</p>\n<p>The burden in a TCPA motion to dismiss volleys back and forth between the parties. First, the movant must demonstrate that the TCPA applies and show by a preponderance of the evidence that the legal action is based on or in response to the movant's exercise of the rights to associate, speak freely, or petition. If the movant clears this burden, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to establish by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of its claim. Finally, if the nonmovant satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts back to the movant to establish as a matter of law any valid affirmative defenses. Ultimately, a TCPA motion to dismiss is not the forum for deciding the winner; it simply decides whether the nonmovant has enough evidence to move to the next round&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Because the TCPA applies to Plaintiff's claims, the ball is in Plaintiff's court to provide prima facie evidence to support his defamation claim&hellip;. Plaintiff must show (1) publication of a false statement of fact to a third party, (2) that was defamatory concerning the plaintiff, (3) with the requisite degree of fault, and (4) damages, in some cases&hellip;.</p>\n<p>[1] Plaintiff must first provide clear and specific evidence that the statement was made and was a statement of fact, which depends on its verifiability and the entire context in which it was made&hellip;. Plaintiff makes this shot &hellip;, at least at the TCPA stage. Plaintiff stated in his declaration that Defendant \"accused [him] of taking photographs of children for inappropriate purposes and implied that [he] was a pervert, pedophile or sexual predator.\" Rather than dealing with these concerns privately, she decided to take them to the court of public opinion: an HOA board meeting that was open to the public and had \"a large audience.\"</p>\n<p>Other evidence also gives the advantage to Plaintiff's claims. The declaration from HOA board president Derek Hooper stated that the challenged statements were made at a board meeting attended by approximately 35-40 people&hellip;. Hooper said he \"understood that [Defendant] was accusing [Plaintiff] of being a pervert, pedophile, or sexual predator because of her previous complaints about [Plaintiff].\" The declaration from HOA board secretary Sarah Green also stated that she \"understood that [Defendant] was publicly accusing [Plaintiff] of being a pervert, pedophile or sexual predator.\" &hellip;</p>\n<p>Defendant tries to sideline Plaintiff's affidavits by saying they present nothing more than conclusory statements. A conclusory statement is one that expresses a factual inference without providing underlying facts to support that conclusion. But here, the statements in the declarations go beyond mere conclusions and provide sufficient underlying facts to show when, where, and what was said as necessary to support Plaintiff's defamation claim.</p>\n<p>[2.] Plaintiff must next present evidence showing that Defendant's statements were reasonably capable of defamatory meaning, which we examine from the perspective of an ordinary person in light of the surrounding circumstances. Defamation per se refers to statements that are so obviously harmful that general damages may be presumed. \"Accusing someone of a crime, of having a foul or loathsome disease, or of engaging in serious sexual misconduct are examples of defamation per se.\"</p>\n<p>Here, the evidence shows that Defendant said Plaintiff was taking photographs of children for \"inappropriate purposes\" and implied that he was a \"pervert, pedophile or sexual predator.\" An ordinary person would understand these statements to accuse Plaintiff of serious sexual misconduct; therefore, they constitute defamation per se and general damages may be presumed.</p>\n<p>Defendant argues that her comments do not qualify as an actionable false statement of fact or a statement implying any undisclosed facts, but that argument is out of bounds. Courts across Texas have held that similar statements are verifiable statements of fact that keep a defamation claim in play&hellip;.</p>\n<p>[3.] Defendant asserts that Plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure, meaning he must serve up evidence of actual malice to maintain his defamation claim. A three-part test determines whether a defamation claimant is a limited-purpose public figure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the controversy at issue must be public both in the sense that people are discussing it and people other than the immediate participants in the controversy are likely to feel the impact of its resolution;</li>\n<li>the plaintiff must have more than a trivial or tangential role in the controversy; and</li>\n<li>the alleged defamation must be germane to the plaintiff's participation in the controversy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These requirements are satisfied here. The tennis versus pickleball debate was a matter of public controversy in the Coles Crossing community, the net effect of which would affect community members' ability to play at their local courts. Plaintiff was a major player in the controversy, as head of the exploratory pickleball committee. Finally, the alleged defamatory statements were related to Plaintiff's role in the controversy, <em>i.e.</em>, the reason he was taking photographs during a children's tennis clinic.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the deciding point at this stage is whether Plaintiff brought forth prima facie evidence of actual malice\u2014that the defamatory statements were published with either knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for their truth. To show a reckless disregard for the truth, the plaintiff \"must establish that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the publication or had a high degree of awareness of the probable falsity of the published information.\"</p>\n<p>Plaintiff made the required showing: Defendant had twice been informed of the legitimate reasons for Plaintiff's photographs, but persisted in accusing Plaintiff of inappropriate purposes. Hooper said he and two other board members scheduled a meeting with Defendant after the board meeting to address \"her persistent pattern of disruptive conduct.\" According to Hooper, Defendant \"admitted &hellip; that she should not have made the derogatory comments about [Plaintiff] and acknowledged that she was wrong about [Plaintiff] being a pervert, pedophile or sexual predator\"\u2014further showing that Defendant made the statements with reckless disregard for their truth. Taken together and viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, this constitutes prima facie evidence that Defendant made the alleged defamatory statements with a high degree of awareness of their probable falsity.</p>\n<p>Defendant makes two arguments in response. She first argues that a subsequent apology is not evidence of actual malice. But the Supreme Court of Texas has held that that the actual malice standard was satisfied where defendant\u2014unprompted\u2014\"expressed doubt to a friend that there was any basis for the charges he was making.\" This is especially true here because of the direct evidence that Defendant had been told of the innocent purpose for the pictures multiple times before the meeting. Defendant's second serve fails too: she argues that Plaintiff's actual motive in taking the pictures is \"unverifiable,\" but all that is required at this stage is \"a rational inference that the allegation of fact is true.\" Plaintiff has met that standard&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the court concluded that plaintiffs' intentional infliction of emotional dismiss claim was duplicative of the defamation claim and should be dismissed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>IIED is not an ace; it is merely a \"'gap-filler' tort, judicially created for the limited purpose of allowing recovery in those rare instances in which a defendant intentionally inflicts severe emotional distress in a manner so unusual that the victim has no other recognized theory of redress.\" Accordingly, \"[w]here the gravamen of a plaintiff's complaint is really another tort, [IIED] should not be available.\" &hellip;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/10/pickleball-vs-tennis-leads-to-defamation-lawsuit/\">Pickleball vs. Tennis Leads to Defamation Lawsuit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

This false perception equates physical acts that can injure or kill people with disagreements and insults that might cause hurt feelings and potentially justifies responding to the latter with the former. After all, if words are violence, why not rebut a verbal sparring partner with an actual punch? Unfortunately, the idea is embedded on college campuses where a majority of undergraduate students agree that words and violence can be the same thing.</p>\n\n<h1>Most Believe Words Can Be Violence</h1>\n<p>\"Ninety one percent of undergraduate students believe that words can be violence, according to a new poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression [FIRE] and College Pulse,\" FIRE <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/news/fire-poll-90-undergrads-believe-words-can-be-violence-even-after-killing-charlie-kirk\">announced</a> last week. \"The survey's findings are especially startling coming in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination\u2014an extreme and tragic example of the sharp difference between words and violence.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/how-assassination-charlie-kirk-reshaping-campus-speech-nationwide\">survey</a> posed questions about speech and political violence to undergraduate students at Utah Valley University, where Kirk was murdered, and at colleges elsewhere\u20142,028 students overall. FIRE and College Pulse compared the student responses to those of members of the general public who were <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/24/most-americans-think-free-speech-is-on-the-decline-survey-finds/\">separately polled</a>.</p>\n<p>Specifically, one question asked how much \"words can be violence\" described respondents' thoughts. Twenty-two percent of college undergraduates answered that the sentiment \"describes my thoughts completely,\" 25 percent said it \"mostly\" described their thoughts, 28 percent put it at \"somewhat,\" and 15 percent answered \"slightly.\" Only 9 percent answered that the \"words can be violence\" sentiment \"does not describe my thoughts at all.\"</p>\n<p>It's difficult to get too worked up about those who \"slightly\" believe words can be violence, but that still leaves us at 75 percent of the student population. And almost half of students \"completely\" or \"mostly\" see words and violence as essentially the same thing. That's a lot of young people who struggle to distinguish between an unwelcome expression and a punch to the nose.</p>\n<p>Depressingly, <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/24/most-americans-think-free-speech-is-on-the-decline-survey-finds/\">34 percent of the general public \"completely\" or \"mostly\" agree</a>. Fifty-nine percent at least \"somewhat\" believe words can be violence.</p>\n<p>In 2017, when the conflation of words and violence was relatively new, Jonathan Haidt, a New York University psychology professor, worried that the false equivalence fed into the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/mental-health/latest-federal-data-show-that-young-people-are-more-likely-than-older-adults-to-be-experiencing-symptoms-of-anxiety-or-depression/\">simmering mental health crisis</a> among <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11790661/\">young people</a>. He and FIRE President Greg Lukianoff <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/\">wrote</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em> that \"growing numbers of college students have become less able to cope with the challenges of campus life, including offensive ideas, insensitive professors, and rude or even racist and sexist peers\" and that the rise in mental health issues \"is better understood as a crisis of resilience.\"</p>\n<h1>Conflating Words and Violence Encourages Violence</h1>\n<p>Telling young people who haven't been raised to be resilient and to deal with the certainty of encountering debate, disagreement, and rude or hateful expressions in an intellectually and ideologically diverse world plays into problems with anxiety and depression. It teaches that the world is more dangerous than it actually is rather than a place that requires a certain degree of toughness. Worse, if words are violence it implies that responding \"in kind\" is justified.</p>\n<p>\"At a time of rapidly rising political polarization in America, it helps a small subset of that generation justify political violence,\" Haidt and Lukianoff added.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, last week Gallup <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/697745/youth-loneliness-political-violence.aspx\">reported</a> that \"age is the strongest predictor of attitudes toward political violence, with young adults aged 18\u201329 more likely than other age groups to say that it is sometimes OK to use violence to achieve a political goal.\" Thirty percent of respondents 18\u201329 say it is \"sometimes\" acceptable to use violence to achieve political goals, compared to 21 percent of those 30\u201344, 13 percent of those 45\u201359, and 4 percent of people 60 and older.</p>\n<p>And yes, acceptance of political violence has changed over the tears. For those 18 to 29, it was 22 percent in 1970 and 21 percent in 1995. For 30-to-44-year-olds, it was 16 percent in 1970 and 15 percent in 1995. The percentage remained largely unchanged for those 45\u201359 and dropped for people over 60.</p>\n<p>Kirk was <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/22/americas-free-speech-culture-is-under-attack-from-within/\">assassinated by, allegedly, a 22-year-old who strongly disliked</a> what the conservative activist had to say. The incident is a real-life example of the dangers of conflating speech and violence. It's not acceptable to respond to words you don't like with physical force.</p>\n<h1>There's a Silver Lining\u2014Sort of</h1>\n<p>That said, there is encouraging news. The percentage of college undergrads who say it is at least \"rarely\" acceptable to shout down speakers to prevent them from speaking on campus has dropped to 68 percent from 72 percent last spring. Forty-seven percent of students say it is at least rarely acceptable to block other students from attending a campus speech, down from 54 percent in the spring. And 32 percent find it acceptable to use violence to stop a speech, down from 34 percent.</p>\n<p>But sentiments can be overshadowed by high-profile incidents like assassinations. \"Because of what happened to Charlie Kirk,\" 45 percent of students are \"less comfortable\" expressing their views on controversial political topics during in-class discussions, notes FIRE in its findings. And neither sentiments nor comfort in self-expression have universally shifted.</p>\n<p>\"Moderate and conservative students across the country became significantly less likely to say that shouting down a speaker, blocking entry to an event, or using violence to stop a campus speech are acceptable actions,\" writes FIRE. \"In contrast, liberal students' support for these tactics held steady, or even increased slightly.\"</p>\n<p>As a consequence, 84 percent of Utah Valley students say the country is headed in the wrong direction when it comes to people's ability to freely express their views. At other colleges and universities, 73 percent feel the same way (almost identical to the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/24/most-americans-think-free-speech-is-on-the-decline-survey-finds/\">feeling of the public at large</a>). It should be noted, however, that the news is more positive when students are asked about their own campuses; 53 percent say their own schools are headed in the right direction.</p>\n<p>These students are headed into a world in which many of their peers see little difference, if any, between words and violence. They adhere to this position even after Kirk was murdered for, almost certainly, what he had to say. And they do so in an <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/23/americans-say-politically-motivated-violence-is-increasing-and-they-see-many-reasons-why/\">environment</a> of <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/06/23/political-violence-surges-because-politics-matters-too-much/\">surging political violence</a>.</p>\n<p>Americans worry that the country is becoming less friendly to free expression. But the insistence of too many people that words and violence are the same thing is a big part of the problem.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/survey-91-percent-of-college-students-think-words-can-be-violence-that-could-feed-real-violence/\">Survey: 91 Percent of College Students Think &#039;Words Can Be Violence.&#039; That Could Feed Real Violence.</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

Welcome to my Hallmark movie casting call.</p> <p>My vision is as follows. You: a busy careerist or parent or homemaker. The specifics aren't important, other than your main personality trait, which is \"busy.\" Setting: the holidays, as I've been reliably informed that this is a requirement for Hallmark films. The drama: You are not done shopping for presents, and it is crunch time.</p> <p>Oh no.</p> <p>Enter me, your holiday fairy godmother. (Like any good director, I am casting myself as the hero.) While you're melting down at the prospect of spreading insufficient cheer\u2014your character in ruins, the pressure too much to bear\u2014I appear. Timing is everything. I whisk you away to our supporting cast, a merry band of weirdos, who soothe your sorrows with unorthodox gift suggestions that would have been impossible to find elsewhere. Thanks to the beauties of technology and capitalism, our story need not take place in the quintessential small town. It unfolds instead in the digital sphere, where a massively expanded inventory is available a few clicks away. This isn't your stereotypical Hallmark film. It's going to be a banger.</p> <p>So let us begin.</p> <p>As your holiday guide, I must recommend what is best for every good little man, woman, and child: the gift of freedom, in the form of <em>Reason</em> magazine. Perhaps you know someone who likes freedom. Perhaps you know someone who hates freedom. <em>Reason</em> is perfect for both, whether to elicit a \"yes, queen!\" or a conversion. Buy three-, two-, or one-year subscriptions\u2014all for a little over $1 an issue\u2014<a href=\"https://reason.secure.darwin.cx/J4LGPR1R\">here</a>, before printing out this <a href=\"https://reason.com/the-holiday-gift-of-reason/\">cute little graphic</a> we made and wrapping it in a box. They'll never see it coming.</p> <p>We also have our <a href=\"https://shop.reason.com/\">swag store</a> with selections for babies, toddlers, and adults. Among other things, we sell a <a href=\"https://shop.reason.com/collections/reason-essentials/products/unisex-tie-dye-t-shirt\">tie dye tee</a>, maybe for those who spend time wistfully remembering 1990s fashion. Who can say? We also offer this <a href=\"https://shop.reason.com/collections/reason-essentials/products/neck-gaiter\">neck gaiter</a>, which is slightly reminiscent of the disguises federal immigration officers are donning these days, except it has Reason branding. Please do not get any ideas.</p> <p>After all, we have all the brilliant ideas you could possibly need to triumph over your shopping anxiety. Scroll on for your happy ending. \u2014<strong><em>Billy Binion, reporter</em></strong></p> <h1>For the Sleeping Beauty who struggles with the sleeping part:</h1> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360132 alignleft\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360132 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/kindle-bed-mount-239x300.png\" alt=\"Kindle bed mount\" width=\"239\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Amazon\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kindle-bed-mount-239x300.png 239w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kindle-bed-mount.png 702w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px\" /><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>Cursed with being a two-stage sleeper, I try to focus on the upside: I get to do about an hour of nightly interruption-free reading with my Kindle, usually between 4 and 5 a.m. Eventually, my eyes go soft focus and I drift off for round two. I used to drop the device off the side of the bed, snapping awake to a thud.</p> <p>My <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0F214XDDM/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Kindle bed mount with a page-turning wireless remote</a> has solved that problem and made being awake in the middle of the night less miserable. I'm a stomach sleeper, so I orient my head sideways on the pillow at my preferred angle, with the screen comfortably in view. The remote goes in my opposite hand off to the side, allowing me to turn the pages with an almost imperceptible finger movement. Because my body stays completely inert, it's easier to fall back asleep. And your loved ones do not need to suffer from a tortured sleep schedule to enjoy this gift, as it'll nudge the recipient toward reading great books instead of falling down their nightly social media rabbit hole.</p> <p>My contraption is currently loaded with Vincent Cannato's <em>The Ungovernable City</em>, a 720-page recounting of former New York Mayor John Lindsay's disastrous time in office. The book is newly relevant now that socialist Zohran Mamdani is on the verge of taking office in my poor city. Next, I'll be rereading Thomas Sowell's masterpiece <em>Knowledge and Decisions</em> for a libertarian book club I just formed with my libertarian son, libertarian dad, and not-at-all libertarian mother-in-law (though she does read Reason and is very tolerant of what I push on her).</p> <p>Reading Sowell will be even more delightful than usual with my Kindle bed mount with wireless remote control. The insomniac in your life will treasure it too. \u2014<em><strong>Jim Epstein, executive editor</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0F214XDDM/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Buy the Kindle holder with remote page turner for $28.05</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360134 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360134 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/eight-sleep-pod-300x160.png\" alt=\"Eight Sleep Pod\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" data-credit=\"Eight Sleep\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/eight-sleep-pod-300x160.png 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/eight-sleep-pod-768x409.png 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/eight-sleep-pod.png 868w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>Eight Sleep</figcaption></figure> <p>My best days (and nights) have been in bed. But as any <em>femme d'un certain \u00e2ge</em> will tell you, once your hormones go haywire, nothing will knock you out despite mainlining melatonin and desperately doomscrolling through sleep apps at 3 a.m.</p> <p>Enter the <a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com/product/pod-cover/\">Eight Sleep Pod</a>, a hydropowered bed cover that circulates water of your chosen temperature beneath you, cooling your sweaty self down and sending you into deep dreamland.</p> <p>Regulation is always a touchy subject for libertarians, but when it comes to sleepytime <em>temperature</em> regulation, I'm all about central planning: My bed must be chilly, my Bavarian goose down comforter calibrated for springtime, and the air conditioner set to a balmy 72 degrees Fahrenheit. If you're shopping for someone who may live in a house (bed?) divided\u2014maybe your own\u2014take heart: With the Pod's dual-zone temperature regulation, I can keep my side at an arctic 55 degrees Fahrenheit without worrying that my husband will turn into a meat popsicle.</p> <p>Deep-pocketed shoppers will find fun add-ons, like a snore reduction platform that jacks up the price to even more appalling levels, and subscription-based ways to track health metrics like heart rate, respiratory rate, and other science-y metrics that help you rest. Yeah, it's pricey. But consider how much time you waste tossing and turning in hopes of catching some zzzzs!

Heating, ventilation, and AC are now the standard in American households (<a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/08/25/why-europeans-have-less/\">Europe could never</a>). But in 2025, we have a slew of options to further optimize the air around us.</p> <p>That's why a great humidifier is a perfect Christmas gift this season. As temperatures plunge and the air dries out, a humidifier can help lessen the need for constant moisturizing and hydration to keep those crow's-feet at bay. We have two <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0DLLK5FM3/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Canopy Bedside Humidifiers</a> in our home\u2014they're easy to use, easy to clean in the dishwasher on occasion, and easy to change the filters for (on the rare occasions you need them changed).</p> <p>Monitoring the air can be helpful too, whether you're worried about air pollution from a nearby road or just want to know when you can turn off the vent fan in your kitchen after cooking a stovetop meal. I got the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B097YW5Q72/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Airthings View Plus</a> a year ago to monitor particulate matter, carbon dioxide, radon, and more in my home. There are cheaper versions available from Airthings if you're not as neurotic about air quality as I am (though only the View Plus measures particulate matter, a.k.a. air pollution, and that's what I've found most problematic in my house).</p> <p>Capitalism has given us an almost magical ability to control the weather and air inside our homes.

Park Place always costs $350, no matter who owns Boardwalk.</p> <p>The game <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0716P8GKX/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Modern Art</a> manages the trick beautifully. Players get to cosplay as art dealers with control over world-renowned collections and the hunger to take them to the next level. During each turn, someone puts a painting up for auction and the others compete to buy it. As in real life, the artworks have no intrinsic value beyond what players are willing to pay\u2014and your goal, of course, is to maximize returns. At the end of each round, the collections containing works by the best-selling artists, as determined by the results of the auctions themselves, are rewarded with an extra payout (presumably from the art-loving public that's obsessed with your swanky new acquisitions).</p> <p>Price signals emerge spontaneously, and they become clearer as each new painting is brought to market, particularly when it comes to which artists are hot and which are not. The player controlling the auction is trying to squeeze the biggest payday from the others, while everyone else tries to buy low and sell high. Will Sigrid's melancholy vibes be the next big thing? Or can you drive the market towards Manuel's bold street art? Make the most money, and you win.</p> <p>The game is far from new: Modern Art was designed by Reiner Knizia and first sold in Germany in the early 1990s. But it was the best game I was introduced to this year\u2014and it's sure to be a blast for anyone who enjoys the creative chaos of the free market. \u2014<em><strong>Eric Boehm, reporter</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0716P8GKX/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Buy Modern Art for $34.99</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360172 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360172 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/d-and-d-essentials-kit-229x300.png\" alt=\"D&amp;D Essentials Kit\" width=\"229\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Amazon\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/d-and-d-essentials-kit-229x300.png 229w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/d-and-d-essentials-kit-782x1024.png 782w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/d-and-d-essentials-kit-768x1005.png 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/d-and-d-essentials-kit.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" /><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>Over 50 years after its creation, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>\u2014affectionately known as <em>D&amp;D</em>\u2014has officially clawed its way into pop culture. Recently the inspiration for a major feature film, the world's most famous role-playing game appears to be bigger than ever. If you've been cautiously considering joining the dice-rolling ranks, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786966831/reasonmagazinea-20/\"><em>D&amp;D</em> Essentials Kit</a> is the perfect entry point, whether you're a first-time player or a veteran emerging from retirement.</p> <p>Inside, you'll find everything you need to begin your first adventure: dice to roll, character sheets to fill out, a simple rulebook to learn the rules of the road, and a starter quest in the mythical and fantastical Forgotten Realms to take on. Your appointed Dungeon Master\u2014maybe you, should you accept the challenge\u2014carves out the contours of your tale, while the supporting characters flesh it out as the game proceeds. There are monsters to fight and spells to cast, all while a dragon lies somewhere in wait to terrorize your party. Maybe you'll fight the beast; maybe you'll attempt to negotiate with it; maybe you'll ignore it entirely. The choice is entirely up to you, and the possibilities seem endless.</p> <p>That's the real magic of <em>D&amp;D</em>: the freedom to explore, experiment, and shape your own story. It's a good reminder that people thrive when they can ultimately chart their own destinies without inhibition. \u2014<em><strong>Phillip Bader</strong></em><strong>,\u00a0<em>marketing coordinator</em></strong></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786966831/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Buy the <em>D&amp;D</em> Essentials Kit for $23.24</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360173 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360173 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/the-mind-card-game-218x300.png\" alt=\"The Mind card game\" width=\"218\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Amazon\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/the-mind-card-game-218x300.png 218w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/the-mind-card-game.png 692w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px\" /><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>Looking to gift a fun group activity that's quick and easy to learn? <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07C4F3KLF/reasonmagazinea-20/\">The Mind</a> is a minimalist card game where players must place numbered cards\u20141 to 100\u2014in ascending order. The catch: Everyone must cooperate without speaking or signaling; success depends entirely on coordination, hunches, and trust. If someone lays down a card with a higher number than one held by another player, the group loses a life. Stay alive to keep leveling up.</p> <p>The game perfectly captures that spontaneous order\u2014and the individual coordination it depends on\u2014can emerge from ambiguity and chaos. (It's also a surefire way to avoid noise complaints when you have friends over, but I digress.)

With a built-in strainer, it separates the pulp and the liquid into separate containers for a convenient juicing experience. (If you're really looking to get crunchy, freeze the pulp instead of throwing it away, and add it to smoothies for an extra nutritional boost.) Every J2 comes with a recipe book for novices to kickstart their health journey.</p> <p>Buyer beware: The juicer is made in South Korea, which, under the protectionist Trump administration, means that it could be subject to tariffs.

And no movie took on that year's combination of anger, paranoia, and can't-make-it-up insanity more directly than this film. Directed with winking glee by cult horror auteur Ari Aster, <em>Eddington</em> reimagines the pandemic and the politics around 2020 first as shotgun-blast satire, and then as something more like a nightmare.</p> <p>When the movie starts, it follows a small-town sheriff in New Mexico who is bothered by the obvious hypocrisy of mask advocates. He's countered by an obnoxious mayoral candidate who argues that the sheriff is being selfish and unreasonable. All around them, society seems to erupt in Black Lives Matter protests and inscrutable ads for crypto and broad-based social disruption, much of it run through internet culture.</p> <p>But what starts as a sharp-witted smirk eventually devolves into something more terrifying, as well-funded antifa soldiers descend on the town and the sheriff finds himself in a murderous, all-out rage on its streets. It's a movie about how, in 2020, everyone went totally crazy. And its manic finale suggests that the only way to really reckon with that year's impact is to relive it as a fever dream of social upheaval, entirely divorced from common sense or basic reality\u2014because in some deep and still-traumatic sense, that's what it was. \u2014<em><strong>Peter Suderman, features editor</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0FP8C99C1/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Buy <em>Eddington</em> on Blu-ray for $29.99</a></p> <h1>For the doomsday practitioner readying for apocalypses big and small:</h1> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360204 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360204 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/jackery-500-gift-300x246.png\" alt=\"Jackery 500\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\" data-credit=\"Amazon\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jackery-500-gift-300x246.png 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jackery-500-gift-768x629.png 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jackery-500-gift.png 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>I'm not ashamed of the fact I have a touch of prepper\u2014grow up dodging ice storm blackouts and tornadoes, all in the twilight of the Cold War, and you, too, will plan ahead for when the grid flickers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07SM5HBK1/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Jackery 500</a> is a portable battery with 500 watt-hours.

But the beauty of living in an era of insane technological innovation is that you do not have to do that. The Jackery has some major advantages: There is a built-in inverter, so that you can run alternating-current devices (like laptops) off of the direct-current power, notably while on the lam. Also it does not need to be grounded. I don't know how to ground a battery\u2014last time I attempted it, I kept electrocuting my so-called friend Billy.

As the head of <a href=\"https://kniferights.org/\">Knife Rights</a>, buying Ritter's design also helps his efforts against restrictive knife laws.</p> <p>Some knife fanciers insist folding knives are weakened by the pivot. A connoisseur may prefer a fixed-blade knife sized for everyday carry. I gave my son a budget-friendly <a href=\"https://www.bladehq.com/item--Gerber-Stowe-Fixed-Blade-Knife--174457\">Gerber Stowe</a> with a 2.5-inch 440A stainless steel blade and micarta handle scales. It comes with a leather sheath that keeps the overall 6-inch knife relatively discreet on a belt. For an upgrade, consider <a href=\"https://www.bladehq.com/item--ESEE-Knives-Sencillo-Brown-Micarta--183814\">ESEE's Sencillo</a> (\"simple\" in Spanish), a 7.25-inch knife with a 3-inch blade and burlap micarta handle scales. The Magnacut version of the knife appears to be sold out everywhere, but the A2-steel version is plenty sharp and durable. I would know, as I carry it on me. \u2014<em><strong>J.D.

I collect ways to make decent coffee on the go. (We are not the same.) After one too many watery hotel brews and overpriced chain coffees, I started bringing my own setup\u2014and this small <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B098W5RMF1/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Japanese dripper from MUNIEQ</a>, called the Tetra, has become my absolute favorite travel companion. Sorry, husband!</p> <p>It's made of stainless steel, it folds entirely flat, and it somehow feels both delicate and sturdy at the same time. It's easy to assemble and fits neatly in your bag\u2014or even your wallet, for our coffee kings. It's technically designed for camping (ahem, glamping), but there's no reason you shouldn't take it on your next trip abroad. All you need are filters, ground coffee, and hot water, and you can make a satisfying coffee cup wherever you are.</p> <p>This is the perfect gift for that friend or family member who is always on the move yet refuses to settle for bad coffee. And thanks to the miracle that is global, interconnected free enterprise, this contraption\u2014designed and manufactured in Japan\u2014can be someone's globetrotting partner after just a few clicks and (relatively) few dollars. \u2014<em><strong>Katarina Hall, staff editor</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B098W5RMF1/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Buy the Tetra Portable Coffee Drip for $41.07</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360241 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360241 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/Glencairn-Glass-gift-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Glencairn Crystal\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Glencairn-Glass-gift-300x300.png 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Glencairn-Glass-gift-150x150.png 150w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Glencairn-Glass-gift-768x765.png 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Glencairn-Glass-gift-400x400.png 400w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Glencairn-Glass-gift-800x800.png 800w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Glencairn-Glass-gift-675x675.png 675w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Glencairn-Glass-gift.png 974w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>Glencairn Crystal</figcaption></figure> <p>For the whiskey, scotch, bourbon, or glassware lover in your life, I recommend gifting them a <a href=\"https://glencairn.com/product/cut-glencairn-glass/\">Glencairn Glass</a>. Designed in Scotland, this item is the standard-bearer for savoring a dram of whiskey and experiencing a taste of Brigadoon from the comfort of your La-Z-Boy.</p> <p>I'll admit I was initially skeptical. What would make this meaningfully different from a tumbler? Be serious. But after my first sip of Lagavulin from a Glencairn, I was a convert. The tapered design perfectly delivers the complex taste and aroma of the spirit, and the crystalline glass\u2014mouth cut and hand blown\u2014allows you to marvel at the color of your whiskey. It also just feels really good to hold in your hand. Simple pleasures.</p> <p>What about the teetotalers in your life? No matter\u2014I'd still recommend this product. Crafted from leaded crystal (though there is a standard lead-free variation too), this glass has a nice weight and a gorgeous shine, making it a great addition to any glassware collection. Pour some lemonade and feel bougie.</p> <p>And you don't have to break the bank. The cut leaded crystal version is currently selling for around $33, and the lead-free version is on the market right now for just $8. If you want it to be extra special, you can supplement with an engraving for a small upcharge.

Let me introduce you to <a href=\"https://wondergarten.net/\">Wondergarten</a>. What started as an in-home preschool run by Texas couple Lisa and Nathaniel Santa Cruz has become somewhat of an early-childhood empire, featuring a podcast, merchandise, and more. There are seasonally-themed, non-academic books full of songs, stories, and child-friendly art, kitchen, and nature activities\u2014grounded in a curriculum that emphasizes creativity and imagination. There's an online store selling everything from craft supplies to custom playsilks.</p> <p>But the real standout, in my opinion, is the Wondergarten music, composed by Nathaniel Santa Cruz and performed by Kathryn Brunner. It makes a great entry point into the whimsical Wondergarten world for kids and families who won't be doing the whole curriculum. The albums are free to listen to on the Wondergarten website but can also be purchased there in CD format, or as MP3s on iTunes; illustrated songbooks, featuring sheet music and lyrics, are also for sale in physical and digital formats. So it is possible to gift this music from far away, or in an unwrappable form.</p> <p>My two sons\u2014ages 2 and 4\u2014have loved listening to the Wondergarten albums, which are broken down by season and month and feature a cast of characters that includes Mr. Hamilton Squirrel, Mr. Morrison Mole, and several distinct gnomes and fairies, as well as personifications of the natural world (such as Sister Flame and Grandfather Moon). The songs are cute and creative without being cloying, which is likely a relief to parents who are really, really tired of hearing <em>Cocomelon</em>. Some of the musical accompaniment is genuinely lovely.</p> <p>After getting hooked on the albums, we started listening to the Wondergarten podcast, which features enchanting and well-produced tales of the gnomes and other familiar inhabitants of Wondergarten. Not only is my 4-year-old transfixed by these, but they've also inspired a lot of imaginative play on his own.</p> <p>With Wondergarten, the Santa Cruz family has created a fun, immersive, and wonder-filled world that feels like a reprieve from the media and activities typically aimed at children these days. It's engaging without being fast-paced, high-tech, or neon-tinged. It doesn't assume small boys and girls must have totally different interests. It's wholesome without being explicitly religious. There are no superheroes or royalty. It's all about encouraging exploration, imagination, and independence\u2014things that most parents, but perhaps especially libertarian-leaning ones, can appreciate. \u2014<em><strong>Elizabeth Nolan Brown, senior editor</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://wondergarten.net/\">Shop Wondergarten</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360253 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360253 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-300x300.png\" alt=\"YEABRICKS LED Light for Lego\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Amazon\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-300x300.png 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-150x150.png 150w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-768x768.png 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-400x400.png 400w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-800x800.png 800w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-675x675.png 675w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit.png 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>Is your home decor populated heavily with LEGO displays?

I know, I know. Groundbreaking.</p> <p>Being a free-range parent doesn't mean disregarding safety; it just means it's up to you to set reasonable guardrails. So when my toddler got old enough to start riding her tricycle and skateboard around the neighborhood, I got her a Triple 8 helmet to keep that precious noggin in one piece. (You get only one, after all.) The helmets are high-quality and easily adjustable. They also look good, which should minimize futile protestations about the dorkiness of safety accessories.

When anxiety hits, the necklace naturally slows your exhale, helping your body relax almost instantly.</p> <p>I've had mine for a while, and it's become one of my favorite little grounding rituals. It's helped me manage stress, fight burnout, sleep more easily, and even ease cravings.

Consider getting them what is arguably the foil to a keyboard and warrioring fingers: a set of knitting needles and some yarn. I'll admit that it might sound uncool. But grandma hobbies are undergoing a serious renaissance, and it's deeply rewarding to develop the skills necessary to make your own unique accessories and clothing. (Plus, busy hands can't doomscroll.)</p> <p>The age-old wisdom is that an aspiring knitter should start by making a scarf. A secret: That's a surefire way to bore someone out of the hobby. Instead, I recommend a washcloth as a first project. It's a cheap way to give someone an introduction to knitting, so the risk is low: A few balls of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QHGVGY/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Lily Sugar 'N Cream 100 percent cotton yarn</a> and a pair of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QHDAV8/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Clover Size 7 bamboo knitting needles</a> won't run you more than $25 at your local craft store or online. The project can be completed in just a few evenings, there are countless free patterns and tutorials online, and mistakes basically don't matter. A washcloth with holes or wonky edges still scrubs.</p> <p>And hey, if you're lucky, your giftee might be inspired to make you something special next Christmas. After all, your local yarn store\u2014yes, those exist\u2014says a lot about the true miracle that is international trade. I'm currently knitting a striped sweater using merino wool yarn produced in Italy, stainless steel needles made in China, and a pattern written by a Danish designer. It's incredible that today's crafters can access materials made in dozens of countries, let alone afford them.

The government shouldn't be tracking us more than they already do. \u2014<em><strong>Natalie Dowzicky, managing editor of video and podcasts</strong></em></p> <div></div> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">Plan a trip with ChatGPT</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360285 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360285 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/FarmKind-300x298.png\" alt=\"FarmKind pig\" width=\"300\" height=\"298\" data-credit=\"FarmKind\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FarmKind-300x298.png 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FarmKind-150x150.png 150w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FarmKind.png 544w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>FarmKind</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps you have an animal lover on your Christmas list who would murder you for making the classic faux pas of gifting them a pet. (Understandable.) So instead of inviting another critter into their home, harness the power of effective altruism and spark some animal-related joy with <a href=\"https://www.farmkind.giving/\">FarmKind</a>\u2014a nonprofit that has done its homework to identify the best charities working to end factory farming and reduce animal suffering.</p> <p>You can split your donation among all the charities FarmKind supports or direct it to a specific organization that you think would resonate most with the recipient. FarmKind-supported nonprofits are creating innovative and cruelty-free food options, working with companies to improve their animal welfare standards, and pioneering new and more humane food systems. And, since FarmKind's operating costs are covered by philanthropists, every dollar you give goes straight to the organizations that are directly helping animals. They'll even tell you how many animals your gift helps save.</p> <p>Don't have an animal obsessive in your life? Although that may make me question your social circle a bit, you can apply this gift idea to philanthropic ventures of any kind that would resonate with your loved ones' particular soft spots. Print a one-pager with details on the charity (or charities) you chose, wrap it in a shirt box, and place it under the tree. This gift will go a lot further than whatever Tommy Bahama apparel they were expecting. \u2014<em><strong>Kelvey Vander Hart, communications specialist</strong></em></p> <div></div> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.farmkind.giving/\">Give with FarmKind</a></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">Ask ChatGPT about great charities</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360287 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360287 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/cash-christmas-gift-220x300.jpg\" alt=\"Cash raining down on a man\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Andrei Malov | Dreamstime.com\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cash-christmas-gift-220x300.jpg 220w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cash-christmas-gift-751x1024.jpg 751w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cash-christmas-gift-768x1047.jpg 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cash-christmas-gift-1126x1536.jpg 1126w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cash-christmas-gift-1502x2048.jpg 1502w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/cash-christmas-gift-scaled.jpg 1877w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" /><figcaption>Andrei Malov | Dreamstime.com</figcaption></figure> <p>This year, my holiday gift recommendation is simple, elegant, and fully compliant with even the strictest minimalist-libertarian gifting norms: money.</p> <p>Cash is the ultimate expression of consumer sovereignty. It requires no assembly, no batteries, and most importantly, no presumption that I know better than you what will maximize your utility. Hayek warned us about the fatal conceit; I'm merely applying his warning to holiday shopping. Why risk gifting someone a sweater that fits like price controls when I can hand them a medium of exchange and let the market work its magic?</p> <p>But criminally underrated is that money, unlike most presents, doesn't impose future obligations. It won't guilt you into wearing it, reading it, watering it, charging it, or finding a place to display it when you haven't even solved that conundrum with last year's artisanal coaster set. It's the only gift fully compatible with the non-aggression principle: no coercion, no nudging, no passive aggressive \"I thought this was your style.\"</p> <p>The classic counter: \"But cash is so impersonal!\" For a rebuttal, we can look to Milton Friedman, who reminded us that \"there's no such thing as a free lunch.\" Indeed. Which is why money is the perfect gift. \u2014<em><strong>Veronique de Rugy, contributing editor</strong></em></p> <div></div> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Can't help you with this one</a></p><p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/the-2025-libertarian-gift-guide-28-great-ideas-for-apocalypse-preppers-boozers-self-improvers-and-more/\">The 2025 Libertarian Gift Guide: 28 Great Ideas for Apocalypse Preppers, Boozers, Self-Improvers\u2014and More</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

During a rally Tuesday evening in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, President Trump reminded both Republicans and Democrats of just how savvy a messenger he can be when energizing his base.

He discussed his efforts to bring higher wage jobs to American workers, not illegal aliens. He dismantled Obamacare, highlighting high costs and the trillions in taxpayer dollars given to insurance companies instead of the American people. President Trump went full MAGA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe energy in the room was electric. The subliminal message was clear: Republicans, take this message and run with it during the 2026 midterm election cycle. President Trump tore apart Obamacare. He is tired of insurance companies lining their pockets with Obamacare subsidies, and stated once again that he wants that money sent directly to the American people.\n\n.@POTUS: \"Under Obamacare, trillions of dollars were given directly to health insurance companies...I want to give billions of dollars directly to the people...I want to give NOTHING to the insurance companies...We want you to go out and buy your own health insurance.\" pic.twitter.com/Yrr3dmZOmF \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump Touts the Economy and Tackles 'Affordability' in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump Shares Incredible Update About National Guardsman Shot in DC Terror Attack\n\nImagine being able to use your own money to purchase health insurance instead of those dollars going straight to the insurance companies? For Republicans in 2026, this is a smart policy that could excite the base in an election cycle where President Trump is not on the ballot. Healthcare across America, in many cases, is unaffordable and frustrating. This is certainly an area where the GOP can make up ground with sound policy ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump has essentially closed our southern border by the sheer power he wields through the executive branch. The administration has now moved to tackle illegal immigration within our borders, in regards to both deportations and American jobs taken by illegal aliens.\n\n.@POTUS: Before I took office, 100% of all net new jobs were going to migrants and illegals. Since I took office, 100% of ALL net job creation is going to AMERICAN CITIZENS \u2014 and now, more Americans are working than any time in the history of our country. pic.twitter.com/7zBoCrPCAE \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nWow. Since President Trump took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American citizens. That is an amazing statistic that every GOP House and Senate member should be touting on the campaign trail. Not for nothing, but President Trump is also clearly tired of immigrants coming to America who do not care to fully assimilate or share our values.\n\n.@POTUS: \"If you don't share our values, contribute to our economy, and assimilate into our society, then we don\u2019t want you in our country \u2014 we don't want you.\" pic.twitter.com/NqBWr1ceZ3 \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump also announced a permanent pause on third-world migration, \"including from hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia, and many other countries.\" This is a very smart and, frankly, important policy. During the recent off-year election cycle, many Americans learned for the first time how many third-world immigrants have infiltrated major American cities. This is a winning message and one the GOP should carry into 2026.\n\nFinally, the deadly drugs have got to stop flowing into this country. President Trump has taken lethal action that is sure to have every drug boat planning to bring drugs to America second-guessing that decision. For some Republicans who support Trump's policy but have struggled to properly communicate the importance to their constituents, the president simplified the issue for the entire party.\n\n\ud83d\udea8POTUS on Venezuelan Drug Boats: \"Think about it\u2014every boat that gets hit, we save 25,000 American lives.\" pic.twitter.com/Kd9mMQBXgJ \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) December 10, 2025\n\nThis is where President Trump is at his best. Instead of litigating the action he has taken on the Venezuelan drug boats, he simply points to the number of American lives his actions are saving. 25,000 American lives is not a small number. For the GOP in 2026, the message from President Trump in Pennsylvania is crystal clear: \"After just 10 months, our border is secure, our spirit is restored, inflation is stopped, wages are up, prices are down...and America is back!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow his lead.\n\nEditor's Note: Help RedState continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration's accomplishments as we continue to usher in the Golden Era of America.

December 10, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to increase System Open Market Account (SOMA) securities holdings to maintain an ample level of reserves through purchases in the secondary market of Treasury bills (or, if needed, of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>These reserve management purchases (RMPs) will be sized to accommodate projected trend growth in the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities as well as seasonal fluctuations, such as those driven by tax payment dates.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Monthly amounts of RMPs will be announced on or around the ninth business day of each month alongside a tentative schedule of purchase operations for the subsequent approximately thirty days. </strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><u><strong>The Desk plans to release the first schedule on December 11, 2025, with a total amount of RMPs of approximately $40 billion in Treasury bills; purchases will start on December 12, 2025. </strong></u></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><u><strong>The Desk anticipates that the pace of RMPs will remain elevated for a few months to offset expected large increases in non-reserve liabilities in April. </strong></u><em><strong>[ZH: and in May Powell is out and Trump replaces him with a dovish surrogate].</strong></em></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After that, the pace of total purchases will likely be significantly reduced in line with expected seasonal patterns in Federal Reserve liabilities. Purchase amounts will be adjusted as appropriate based on the outlook for reserve supply and market conditions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Desk was also directed in October to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency securities into Treasury bills via secondary market purchases. <strong>The monthly schedule of planned purchases will include RMPs as well as these purchases.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Desk plans to distribute the monthly secondary market purchases across two Treasury bill sectors. Purchase amounts in each sector will be determined by sector weights. These sector weights will be based on the 12-month average of the par amount of Treasury bills outstanding in each sector relative to the total amount outstanding across the two sectors as initially measured at the end of September 2025.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><p>For the purists this is \"Reserve Management Purchases\", for the non-purists, QE is back with us.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>SEP PROJECTIONS:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fed Funds</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 3.625% (exp. 3.625%, prev. 3.625%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 3.375% (exp. 3.375%, prev. 3.375%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 3.125% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.125%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 3.125% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.125%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 3.00% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.00%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>GDP Growth</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025:1.7% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.3% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.0% (exp. 1.9%, prev. 1.9%)</li>\n\t<li>2028:1.9% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 1.8% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Unemployment rate</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 4.5% (exp. 4.5%, prev. 4.5%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 4.4% (exp. 4.5%, prev. 4.4%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 4.2% (exp. 4.4%, prev. 4.3%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 4.2% (exp. 4.2%, prev. 4.2%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 4.2% (exp. 4.2%, prev. 4.2%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>PCE Inflation</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 2.9% (exp. 2.9%, prev. 3.0%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.4% (exp. 2.6%, prev. 2.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.1% (exp. 2.1%, prev. 2.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 2.0% (exp. 2.0%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 2.0% (exp. 2.0%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Core PCE Inflation</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 3.0% (exp. 3.0%, prev. 3.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.5% (exp. 2.6%, prev. 2.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.1% (exp. 2.2%, prev. 2.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 2.0% (exp. 2.1%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n</ul><p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"640406f7-0815-4153-b29d-a359b0177fb7\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"199\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, in a difference from the state of play into December 2024's hawkish cut, we note that equity positioning into the Fed looked skewed toward expectations for a benign or mildly hawkish cut that<strong> leaves the high-beta rotation intact,</strong> with the<strong> SPX still contained in a wider trading range</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Implied, realized and vol-of-vol are all back at more normal levels after November\u2019s turbulence, while correlations and the tail-risk indexes sit in the middle or lower end of recent bands.

And they listened to Obama recount stories of people he had brought to the ceremony who had gone untreated for various serious medical conditions because they could not afford it, and then suggest that, because of the bill he was about to sign, those stories would be a thing of the past.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think it\u2019s safe to assume that the Obama supporters who were watching that day would never have imagined that, fifteen years later, Congress would be battling over the extension of several temporary \u201cemergency\u201d subsidies that had had to be put in place to keep Obamacare afloat as healthcare and health insurance costs soared to heights that would have been considered unimaginable to anyone living in 2010. </strong></p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/3B2MWEC.jpg?itok=3bZ_nigq\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/3B2MWEC.jpg?itok=3bZ_nigq\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8a832983-0100-48a5-90e8-712e93498149\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"250\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/3B2MWEC.jpg?itok=3bZ_nigq\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>But\u00a0<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5636382-health-care-obamacare-house-senate/\">here we are</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Congress fights over not whether but\u00a0<em>how</em>\u00a0to extend these covid-era ACA subsidies, it can be tempting to call Obamacare a failure.</strong> I mean, how else would you describe an \u201caffordable care\u201d act that made healthcare and health insurance less affordable while requiring a constant influx of new tax dollars to keep it from falling apart?</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s a reasonable conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>But the problem with it is that it takes the political class at its word and accepts that Obamacare was genuinely meant to make healthcare more affordable and accessible to the American people. It wasn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To understand the true purpose that Obamacare served, you have to first go back and understand why government first intervened in the healthcare market a little over a century ago.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It was not, as the progressive creation myths many of us are taught in school suggest, to protect Americans from maniacal doctors or food and drug companies that were trying to kill them. Nor was it to help Americans afford healthcare\u2014prices back then weren\u2019t anywhere near the absurd levels we see today.</p>\n\n<p>The reason government began intervening in healthcare was because some industry insiders and interest groups recognized that they could achieve and protect a level of market dominance practically unseen up to that point if they stopped merely trying to offer customers more value than their competitors and instead used government power to warp the healthcare industry to their benefit.</p>\n\n<p>That began when a physicians\u2019 interest group\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLtB4Jl1dR0&list=PLALopHfWkFlF8FiKMUYeC_u31CvCxYC4X&index=20&t=2195s\">maneuvered</a>\u00a0its way into setting the accreditation standards for American medical schools. That position of influence allowed the group to ban programs that didn\u2019t align with its specific medical philosophy, leading to the forced closure of nearly half the country\u2019s medical schools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This created an artificial shortage of doctors, which kicked off the affordability crisis that has defined American healthcare ever since.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, the problem was still quite limited in the early days. But as other related industries\u2014especially\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-trump-can-lower-drug-prices-without-price-controls\">pharmaceuticals</a>\u2014began falling prey to the same crony dynamic at the heart of the Progressive Era, healthcare quickly began to grow more expensive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, the health insurance industry followed the lead of healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies and lobbied government officials for rules and regulations that benefited insurance companies\u2019 bottom lines.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That effort culminated in a reworking of the tax code under President Truman. The government made employer-provided health insurance tax-deductible while it continued to tax other forms of employee compensation and other means of paying for care. In other words, the government used the tax code to change how Americans paid for healthcare. It didn\u2019t take long for employer-provided insurance plans to become the dominant arrangement and for health insurance to morph away from actual insurance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shortly after that happened, the government significantly ramped up demand for the artificially-constrained supply of medical care with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, leading to an easily-predictable\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive?d7_alias_migrate=1\">explosion</a>\u00a0in the price of healthcare.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And, as fewer and fewer people could afford healthcare at these higher prices, more government assistance was required, which meant more demand, higher prices, more need for government support, and so on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This was not good for everyday Americans, </strong>but it was excellent for healthcare providers and drug companies whose revenues were ballooning as more and more cash poured into the healthcare system.</p>\n\n<p>And it was great for the health \u201cinsurance\u201d companies. All the taxes on competing means of payment effectively acted as a subsidy, putting the industry in a strong position to benefit from the mounting crisis because, in addition to facilitating most of the country\u2019s healthcare spending, they helped these providers grow far beyond the typical bounds of insurance.</p>\n\n<p>In a free market, insurance serves as a means to trade risk. It works well for accidents and calamities that are hard to predict individually but relatively easy to predict in bulk, like car accidents, house fires, and unexpected family deaths. But with the government incentivizing people to buy healthcare through insurance plans, those plans began to grow to cover easily-predictable occurrences like annual physicals.</p>\n\n<p>So, zooming out, industry leaders and interest groups joined forces with government officials to use government interventions to create a healthcare system designed to move as much money as possible to healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and the insurance industry. That is, and has always been, the main motivation behind the federal government\u2019s healthcare policy.</p>\n\n<p>But, as with any scheme like this, the party cannot last forever. It only works as long as money keeps coming in. For an important service like healthcare, which most people don\u2019t consider optional, the threshold is pretty high. But there is still a point where premiums grow too high, fewer employers or individual buyers are willing to buy insurance, and the flow of money into the healthcare system starts to falter.</p>\n\n<p>According to the government\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hib.html\">own census data</a>, that tipping point was reached in the early 2000s. <strong>For the first time since the scam had really kicked off, the number of people with health insurance began to fall each year. The industry\u2014which had apparently assumed the flow of money would never stop increasing\u2014began to panic. </strong></p>\n\n<p>Something had to be done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And that something was Obamacare.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite all the talk of affordability and access used to sell the bill to the public, the Affordable Care Act is best understood\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Overcharged-Americans-Much-Health-Care/dp/1944424768\">as a ploy</a>\u00a0by the healthcare industry and the government to keep the party going.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Obamacare\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ148/PLAW-111publ148.pdf\">required</a>\u00a0all 50 million uninsured Americans to obtain insurance and greatly expanded what these \u201cinsurance\u201d companies covered. Demand for healthcare shot back up, and the vicious cycle\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/The-Economics-of-ObamaCare/Jasinski/p/book/9781032472317\">started back up again</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As any competent economist was saying\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-daily/socialized-healthcare-vs-laws-economics\">before the bill was even passed</a>, ramping demand back up would not make healthcare more \u201caffordable,\u201d it would only raise prices. And that\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive?d7_alias_migrate=1\">exactly what happened</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, as prices rose higher and health \u201cinsurance\u201d moved further and further away from actual insurance, it\u2019s made the American people even more dependent on the government for healthcare, which is how we\u2019ve arrived at our current situation where extra, \u201ctemporary\u201d subsidies rolled out during an official national emergency need to be made permanent to keep everything going.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you want to take the political establishment at their word, the best you can say is that Obamacare kicked the can down the road and made the healthcare affordability crisis worse in exchange for a bit of temporary relief for some uninsured Americans.</p>\n\n<p>But if you view the ACA within the context of the last century of American healthcare policy, <strong>it reversed the faltering demand for healthcare and health insurance, accelerated the racket</strong> moving as much money as possible into the industry, and quickly became a new political third rail that the \u201copposition\u201d party refuses to even consider rolling back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s hard to view that as anything other than a meaningful success.</strong></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T18:05:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 13:05</span>\n",

For now, there is Romanesque rhetoric but Nero-style fiddling going on.</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the FT also argues \u2018Why the world should worry about stablecoins\u2019, concluding that \u201cDollar-based digital currencies offer benefits for the US, <strong>but Britain and the EU are better off resisting them</strong>.\u201d <strong>Really? How</strong>? Is that also fiddling as things get hotter?</p>\n\n<p>The Politico interview also touched on the \u201cTrump Corollary\u201d to the US Monroe Doctrine, where he refused to rule out boots on the ground in Venezuela, or moves vs Colombia or Mexico. That\u2019s as CNN reports the Trump admin is quietly building plans for what would happen if Maduro were ousted \u2013 as if this is in the passive rather than active sense.</p>\n\n<p>In geoeconomics, Trump\u2019s controversial decision to allow Nvidia to sell H200 AI chips to China is seen by Bloomberg as spurred by Huawei\u2019s AI Gains; the Wall Street Journal states those chips will have to undergo an unusual US security review before being exported to China; and the FT claims China will (again) limit access to them anyway, as it aims for its domestic production. <strong><em>That\u2019s </em>what a push for strategic autonomy looks like \u2013 not lots of grand speeches about strategic autonomy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The EU has announced stricter food import controls to reassure EU farmers and address French conditions for supporting the EU-Mercosur deal: will it therefore replace tariffs with non-tariff barriers? <a href=\"https://public-eur.mkt.dynamics.com/api/orgs/285245b1-7c6f-ef11-a66d-000d3a4b6c6a/r/AU5vxSd6c0qi-noU0GUAAAoAAAA?msdynmkt_target=%7B%22TargetUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmoney%252Fcompanies%252Feu-nations-weigh-tariffs-on-china-following-trumps-lead-on-trade-deficits%252Far-AA1RYH0H%253Focid%253DBingNewsSerp%22%2C%22RedirectOptions%22%3A%7B%225%22%3Anull%2C%221%22%3Anull%2C%222%22%3A%7B%22utm_medium%22%3A%22email%22%2C%22utm_term%22%3A%22N%2FA%22%2C%22utm_source%22%3A%22dynamics-rr%22%2C%22utm_content%22%3A%22Email%20351%22%2C%22utm_campaign%22%3A%22SN%3A%20Email%20351%207a79e1%22%7D%7D%7D&msdynmkt_digest=Pgytm06d96gna%2B4e67kk8%2Fdc8FNjfBmTsV5W9rd6rxQ%3D&msdynmkt_secretVersion=7bb221762d0c46939816d3a5592b1359\">It\u2019s also considering further tariffs on China</a>. Meanwhile, EU Industry Commissioner S\u00e9journ\u00e9 admitted: \"Last month, I was supposed to go to Brazil to discuss a rare earth mine. Three days beforehand we were told that the Americans had come, put money on the table, and bought all production until 2030.\" By contrast, China claims to have pulled off a critical mineral production tech revolution in 10 months, leaving it further ahead. And in the UK, a token vote in favor of rejoining the customs union with the EU passed Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>The FT also reports July\u2019s US-Indonesia trade deal is at risk of collapse, with D.C. believing that Jakarta is reneging on terms of agreement. <strong>Watch this space to see how the US reacts when a country doesn\u2019t stick to a deal.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In political economy, France's National Assembly narrowly approved a contentious 2026 social security budget.

Not coincidentally, the UK\u2019s PM Starmer, a former Human Rights lawyer, urged Europe\u2019s leaders to curb (or can we say, \u2018fiddle with\u2019?) the European Court of Human Rights in order to halt the rise of the far right.</p>\n\n<p>In key data, China\u2019s CPI inflation was unchanged y-o-y at 0.7%, but PPI deflation deepened further to -2.2% from -2.1%. Of course, that shows some economic problems, even if the West would kill for 0.7% CPI. <strong>So do reports that major Chinese EV firms are losing money on every vehicle that they sell. </strong>But when the quid pro quo is global domination of supply chains now close the point of no return for other countries\u2019 established industries <em>such that no future recovery is then possible</em>, <strong>it\u2019s arguably still a tune worth squeezing out of all the instruments of economic statecraft\u2026 even if Neo-liberalism burns.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Against <em>that</em> kind of backdrop, the Fed meeting today is just one little note.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T15:20:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 10:20</span>\n",

Somehow, the sentence I'm about to write is even more dispiriting than the one that precedes it: Kyrgios and Sabalenka spent a half an hour on Tuesday promoting this match on Piers Morgan's show.\n\nThe newsworthy portion of the conversation arrived about halfway through, when Morgan turned to the topic of trans participation in sports. \"Martina Navratilova, a former No. 1 like yourself, says it's wrong for the Women's Tennis Association to allow trans women to compete in its events, do you agree with that?\" Morgan asked. Sabalenka replied:\n\nThat's a tricky question. I have nothing to do against [trans people], but I feel like they still got a huge advantage over the woman, and I think it's just not fair to the woman to basically face biologically a man. It's not fair, the woman been working her whole life to reach her limit, and then she has to face a man, which is biologically much stronger, so for me I don't agree with this kind of stuff in sport.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Kyrgios said that Sabalenka had \"hit the nail on the head.\"\n\nThis is all standard fare that you've heard from anti-trans activists hundreds of times by now, but this particular conversation was made more interesting by where it went next. Immediately after agreeing with Kyrgios and Sabalenka, Morgan brought up an incident from earlier this year when Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostyuk implied that Sabalenka has an advantage over her because of her size and potentially \"higher level of testosterone.\"\n\nHere was an interesting moment. Morgan, totally on accident (he asked this question in order to tee up a punchline built around putting Sabalenka's bikini pictures on screen), had plowed the conversation into a queasy and inconvenient truth that anti-trans agitators refuse to grapple with: In the absence of any actual high-level trans athletes attempting to compete, those who most prominently suffer when trans bans are put into place are cis athletes who do not conform to a particular image of femininity. In other words, if anyone currently on the tour is going to end up being subjected to gross speculation and invasive sex testing under a trans ban, it's players who look like Sabalenka.\n\nNone of this, nor the fact that they had just finished talking about how physical advantages can undermine the competitive fairness of their sport, seemed to enter into Sabalaneka's or Kyrgios's heads as they gave their response about Kostyuk:\n\nSabalenka: All I hear here is just excuses. And it's actually quite funny because she's a strong a girl, she probably has more muscles than I do. She looks fit and strong, and I think that's not the case in all of the matches she lost against top players. Kyrgios: We kind of debunked that. Someone like John Isner or Ivo Karlovi\u0107 was a fair bit bigger than Roger Federer, but that doesn't really\u2014 Morgan: Yeah, you're always going to get physical differences between players, obviously\u2014 Sabalenka: I think that's not the key in sports.\n\nThe most important ingredient in maintaining a commitment to anti-trans bigotry is never stopping to think about anything for more than two seconds.",

    "full_content": "It's the most wonderful time of year, and we at Defector are proud to bring back our series discussing some of the most, uh, available holiday movies.\n\nSabrina Imbler: Thanks so much Kelsey and Alex for trudging through this \u201cfilm\u201d with me.\n\nAlex Sujong Laughlin: I am so excited to be here to talk about one man\u2019s sexual tension with Santa.\n\nKelsey McKinney: Hello. I am here to discuss the queer film My Secret Santa, is this the correct place?\n\nSabrina: You are in the right place! Before we dive into the movie, I have to ask. Have either of you ever cross-dressed to commit workplace fraud?\n\nAlex: I really had to sit for a moment and think about it but I\u2019m gonna lean toward no for now.\n\nKelsey: NOT YET! I\u2019m hoping to in the future.\n\nSabrina: 2026 goals! I did not realize when I chose this film that My Secret Santa is essentially a remake of Mrs. Doubtfire except it\u2019s Santa.\n\nKelsey: It also has shades of She\u2019s the Man/Twelfth Night! All the classics of the cross-dressing for employment genre!\n\nSabrina: My Secret Santa opens with our intrepid hero, Taylor Jacobson, getting fired from her job, Fantine-style, which leaves her in dire financial straits. Not only does she need to pay her overdue rent, she also \"needs\" to pay for presumably a very expensive snowboarding school for her daughter Zoey. This was when the movie first fell apart for me. I thought about that dril tweet where someone is like \u201ccan someone help me budget, my family is dying\u201d and it\u2019s like $200 on groceries, $500 on rent, $5,000 on candles. Here, private snowboarding school is candles.\n\nKelsey: One thing I love about movies of this caliber is that you never know what is going to be important. The opening scene of this movie is her very carefully checking decorated cookies for flaws and pulling out the other ones. It\u2019s implied that she\u2019s pretty good at the cookie job and also that she likes it. But guess what? Cookies are not relevant to this movie at all! We never hear about the cookies again! It was all just a job she could lose.\n\nAlex: As the movie went on I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the very first moment in the movie where she picks a Santa cookie out of the lineup and is like, \u201cHe\u2019s depressed!!\u201d That\u2019s called foreshadowing.\n\nKelsey: Also, that Santa cookie looks identical to all the other ones. It\u2019s also called projection.\n\nSabrina: I got where Taylor was coming from, because it seems no one in this small Christmas town has ever seen a therapist, at least one that was not Santa.\n\nKelsey: Don\u2019t be silly, Sabs. You do not need therapy when you have Christmas Spirit.\n\nSabrina: Soooooo true babe. Luckily Taylor has a plan to make some money. She goes to a used record store and tries to sell her collection of vinyl\u2014she only makes $150, which would probably pay for approximately one hour of elite snowboarding school\u2014where she runs into what we are supposed to believe is an alluring eligible bachelor: local hotel heir Matthew Layne.\n\nAlex: It\u2019s moments like these when I fully grasp the width of the chasm between my opinion of a \u201chot man\u201d and Christmas Movie Hot Man. He is fine. The best part about him I think is that he is a huge fan of Screaming Kittens, which turns out to be ... Taylor\u2019s old band?!\n\nKelsey: At this point, the movie has been on for like 15 minutes and there are already so many things happening: old band, potential love interest, snowboarding school, rent problems, fired from job, and also the approach of Christmas, obviously.\n\nAlex: I have this in my notes: \"'You can\u2019t really be a rock star and a mom at the same time' HELL YEAH.\u201d I think I was excited to have the thesis statement spelled out so quickly. I was hoping for a musical performance at some point and I was not disappointed.\n\nSabrina: Matthew asks Taylor out on the traditional adult Christmas date\u2014drinking hot chocolate while leaving room for Jesus\u2014and she cruelly rebuffs him because she cannot be a rock star and a mom and a girlfriend at the same time, obviously.\n\nAlex: Hot chocolate does not exist in the world except for in Christmas movies, but because of this movie I have been craving hot chocolate constantly and I\u2019ve already had it three times.\n\nKelsey: Now, the movie gives us even more plot! The ski resort where Taylor\u2019s daughter has to go to ski school in order to become an Olympic snowboarder(??) even though she is already 16, is a ski resort that is owned by the love interest\u2019s dad. And his dad is mad at him because he already spent so much money crashing his car into a building in Italy(??). So his dad names him the General Manager of the resort, usurping poor Tia Mowry who was in line for the job.\n\nAlex: THRILLING Tia Mowry appearance! This led me down a rabbit hole to confirm that it appears she and Tamara have reconciled in some way so nobody panic.\n\nSabrina: Oh my god, that\u2019s a real Christmas miracle! Twitches lives!! I was pissed off by how this movie treated Tia\u2019s character. She is the only person in this world who got her job without the influence of nepotism, and she seems to be really good at it. Because of this the movie has decided she is an evil careerist mom and therefore the closest this movie comes to a villain.\n\nTaylor learns from her gay brother (more on that later) that the snowboarding tuition is half-off for Sun Peaks employees, so she goes to the hotel to try and get a job. But Tia informs her that the only job they are hiring for is Santa. Alas, Taylor is too beautiful and too female to play Santa!\n\nAlex: It\u2019s at this point that I\u2019m like ... why are you only considering this right now, seemingly two days before this camp starts? If your daughter is this snowboarding savant and you live in this ski town, would this not have come up sooner?? But these movies are not for airtight storytelling. They are the product of someone putting a bunch of nouns and verbs into a hat and covering their eyes as they draw three.\n\nKelsey: I also just do not believe for a second that being Santa at $2000 a week is going to cover half of a snowboarding camp and your rent backlog. Mountain sports are for rich people! And Taylor cannot even pay her rent or get her daughter a new snowboard. Maybe let\u2019s cool it on the snowboarding camp. Or, we as the audience should be given more context about how good Taylor\u2019s daughter is at snowboarding because the way it\u2019s presented in the movie, it seems like she just thinks it\u2019s cool. And unfortunately only rich kids get to do everything they think is cool!\n\nSabrina: Kelsey I was so confused by that. How has her daughter been snowboarding for so long? Has Taylor just been spending 80 percent of her income on snowboarding? Zoey seemed too well-adjusted to be a pro athlete. But fortunately Taylor\u2019s gay brother has a plan: he and his husband will create an elaborate Santa drag disguise for her. This also made no sense financially. The level of detail of the prosthetic Santa mask, the rich velvet of the costume, all of this money could have simply gone to snowboarding school. Or, frankly, to a financial planner for Taylor, to give her the cold hard truth!\n\nAlex: Just to note that I believe Taylor is 100 percent someone who refers to her brother as \u201cmy gay brother\u201d so that is how I\u2019ll be referring to him. Anyway, somehow her gay brother has all the supplies and technology to make professional-level prosthetics for the face and body.\n\nSabrina: When you\u2019re gay they teach you that in gay school, I think.\n\nKelsey: I did really like the Mission: Impossible sequence where they scanned her head with a 3-D scanner and then printed a new face for her as Santa which the gay brother and gay brother-in-law then painted to look realistic. They filled the Santa belly with lentils. Iconique.\n\nAlex: The mask they make is absolutely terrifying. The final product is \u2026 kind of convincing? Through the screen? But I have a hard time believing it wouldn\u2019t feel uncanny valley up close, so that was in the back of my mind the rest of the movie whenever she was in Santa\u2014or rather, Hugh Mann\u2014costume.\n\nSabrina: The mask clearly works on Hotel Heir Matthew and General Manager Tia, because they hire Taylor as Santa. She tells them her name is Hugh \u2026 Mann. This raised many questions for me. How did she not think ahead to come up with a fake name? What on earth does her W2 look like?\n\nKelsey: What kind of passport did she submit!! The Santa job should be cash under the table anyway, in my opinion.\n\nAlex: Mr. Mann!!! It feels like a drag performance at this point. And the gender excitement just keeps going because then she takes a call in the women\u2019s bathroom thinking it\u2019s empty, but of course a toilet flushes and an old lady comes out. The tone is very Ha ha! It\u2019s a man in the women\u2019s bathroom! Isn\u2019t that silly?!\n\nSabrina: Yeah I refuse to engage with or even imagine this movie\u2019s perspective on trans politics. But the next bathroom Taylor finds herself in is a steamy one. She is led by Chief Elf Jimmy to the men\u2019s locker room to change into her Santa fit, where she runs into a nude Matthew Layne. What proceeds is maybe the most homoerotic scene of the movie\u2019s many homoerotic scenes. Midway through dressing, Matthew asks Taylor-as-Hugh to tie his tie for him. I genuinely thought they were going to bone, or something close to it.\n\nAlex: When Matthew Layne is gazing into Hugh Mann\u2019s eyes and saying he just feels like he can talk to him \u2026 wow, it was a truly romantic moment.\n\nKelsey: To me, it is beautiful that the sexual chemistry between Matthew and Taylor exists even when she is dressed in a giant Santa suit. I love love. What I do not love is that one of the clues the movie plants that Hugh Mann is Taylor is a kind of chapstick that has a unicorn head on the top of it that we are supposed to believe Taylor uses all the time.\n\nSabrina: Honestly I felt like the only times Matthew and Taylor had chemistry is when she was in character as Hugh Mann. Maybe it has to do with the way \u201cstraight\u201d men are able to be intimate in a \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d way in these movies that a heterosexual couple simply cannot. But I was genuinely titillated by the Daddy-Son dynamic between them, and I couldn\u2019t help but fantasize about another Christmas movie where the real Santa finds love in a locker room.\n\nKelsey: No, you\u2019re totally right. There was almost no chemistry when Taylor was dressed as herself. I think part of that is because her character description was mainly \u201cuptight\u201d and \u201cscared.\u201d\n\nAlex: And also when she is Hugh Mann, she is also daddy, which is what Matthew desperately needs.\n\nSabrina: Holy shit. Yes. Yes!!!\n\nKelsey: WOW! Freud! It all makes sense. He just wants to get a drink with his dad and be loved by him.\n\nSabrina: I\u2019m reeling.\n\nAlex: I\u2019m gonna be honest, this is the point in the movie where I wrote \u201cit\u2019s giving mulan\u201d and my notes ended because I was hootin and hollerin at the TV. Speeding through the plot though, Hugh becomes the resort\u2019s Santa and is really bad at it at first because she\u2019s too practical, and then she has a heart to heart with Matthew at a bar.\n\nKelsey: My notes at this point say FLAMING CANDY CANES. Because I was very excited by the drink that is brought out to Matthew and Hugh Mann that has crushed candy canes on the side of it and some kind of floating flammable topper shot. No one drinks these because they light Hugh Mann\u2019s beard on fire, but I liked seeing them.\n\nSabrina: After Taylor tries to give a pep talk to her daughter (while dressed as Santa), Zoey tells Santa that all she wants for Christmas is for her mom to get a boyfriend. This changes Taylor\u2019s whole approach to being Santa from being uptight and practical to becoming a kind of therapist to the many children who wish for something less material than presents.\n\nKelsey: More good evidence in my opinion that we should not be risking our life\u2019s savings on snowboarding school!! Your Christmas wish is for your mom to have a boyfriend?\n\nAlex: Also, just a small note on the topic of Taylor\u2019s financial literacy: I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s wearing a Canada Goose coat in one scene?!? Those are like $1000???\n\nSabrina: And I feel like that\u2019s still less expensive than this Santa drag getup! Which, by the way, has already been repaired twice after the fire incident, and another incident when an overzealous child bursts Hugh Mann\u2019s belly leading him to gush lentils like a burst artery. This was a fun bit of body horror for me, imagining a kind of man who is made of lentils. But soon we come to what was, for me, the absolute worst part of the movie. A young girl who stutters comes up to Hugh Mann and says her Christmas wish is to not stutter anymore, and then Hugh Mann tells her that stuttering can be fixed with the power of song, and then they all sing \u201cJingle Bells\u201d together (in my opinion the worst Christmas song!) and the girl doesn\u2019t stutter and her mom tells her she\u2019s proud of her and the moment goes viral on the internet and this is all used as evidence that Matthew has now become good at general managing a hotel.\n\nKelsey: I hated this part, to be honest. Although, it did lead me to googling whether or not singing helps stuttering and apparently it does help. Also the website it goes viral on is called \"HAPPENED.\" We see it on a computer screen.\n\nSabrina: That reminds me of when Tia Mowry is doing investigative journalism on Hugh Mann and looks him up on a search engine called \u201cLook Path\u201d and then again on a website called \u201cJobization.\u201d I had fun imagining what terrible tech billionaires ruled over this world of Christmas.\n\nAlex: I could tell we were on the path toward a zany party scene where both Taylor and Hugh are invited and expected to make appearances, and I was impatient to get there.\n\nSabrina: The party where Hugh and Taylor both have to be there is a good bit of fun. She has to run back and forth to the bathroom to change in and out of Santa drag with the help of her gay brother, who is also really hungry for some reason? Why didn\u2019t he eat before this?\n\nKelsey: I was dying at the hunger subplot. Why are you so hungry? Why do you want your sister-in-law who is clearly in crisis to bring you weird catered food from upstairs! Just wait!\n\nAlex: And this is where we get an explicitly implied gay sex scene in the bathroom because Matthew walks in and hears Taylor and gay brother grunting and banging on walls as they tried to get her fat suit on, and then Hugh walks out and it\u2019s like\u2026\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nSabrina: I was pleasantly surprised by Matthew\u2019s reaction to hearing what could only have been gay sex in the bathroom of his hotel lobby. He reacted like an ally! Or even a man who might be interested in trying some of that himself!\n\nAlex: I have to imagine that Matthew was at least a little bit curious!!! Given everything he\u2019s going through!!!\n\nKelsey: And also when it was revealed to be his man-crush Hugh Mann who was in there making these sounds, he was very professional and kind. Matthew is an ally.\n\nAlex: By this point, Tia has figured out a connection between Hugh and Taylor because she realized that Hugh had filled out his paperwork with her Social Security number, and she\u2019s like \u201ccheckmate to my nemesis.\u201d She wants to be the general manager of the resort and she thinks exposing Hugh will make Matthew look bad and secure the promotion for her. Which is incredibly misguided because when does sabotaging someone over an opportunity you were already passed over for work out in your favor? Also, these people think and talk about general managers so much more than anyone, ever.\n\nSabrina: After Tia accuses Taylor in front of the party, Taylor is feeling cornered. I thought she was going to do a Mission: Impossible unmasking, ripping off her Santa face and spraying the room with lentils, but then a hotel employee runs in asking for Taylor, because her daughter Zoey had a snowboarding accident. This stressed me out so much because presumably Sun Peaks is not offering their seasonal employee Hugh Mann health insurance??\n\nKelsey: God I wish the lentils had made a comeback!\n\nAlex: I do not ski for many reasons but chief among them is the risk of catastrophic injury, and when Zoey is on a stretcher with her neck in a neck brace I thought it was going to be so much worse than what turned out to be a sprained arm?\n\nSabrina: Yeah they really bait-and-switched us! When I saw the neck brace I was prepared for a worst-case scenario, and then like two scenes later she just is wearing a sling.\n\nKelsey: Insane that there was no concern about health insurance when she took a part-time job to pay for snowboarding school! I did really enjoy the scene though where Taylor forgets she is dressed as Santa and is comforting her injured daughter who is \u2026 so confused about why Santa is there.\n\nSabrina: That\u2019s finally when Hugh Mann unmasks to reveal himself as Taylor, leaving everyone shocked, but Matthew overall seemed pretty chill about it, which I appreciated. Taylor was like, I can explain! And Matthew was like, Your daughter is in a neck brace, which is more important than our situationship. I was a little confused why everyone was so mad about Taylor being Santa. Obviously it\u2019s not a good idea to have hired someone to work with children without doing a background check first, and employment fraud is probably bad, probably? But also I feel like there must be gender discrimination in the Santa industry, and would Taylor have been hired if she had been honest about being a woman?\n\nAlex: Yeah, if this happened in real life, in no universe does the heat come down on the beloved resort Santa. This is a local newspaper investigation into the hiring practices of the resort and how there are no background checks done.\n\nSabrina: This is where I have to be honest and say that the first evening I sat down and tried to watch this movie, I paused after 15 minutes to watch my favorite Christmas-adjacent movie of all time, Spotlight. It was a really good decision. And I returned to My Secret Santa when I had a more open, patient heart.\n\nUltimately Taylor and Matthew reconcile at some kind of unveiling with the same \u201cbig crowd\u201d of 20 extras who appear in every single crowd shot. She decides to walk on stage as Matthew is announcing something and then apologizes, and then Matthew finally admits that he was feeling sexual feelings toward Santa. I wish they had been able to have this conversation in private so that Taylor, as the sister of a gay brother, might have been able to shepherd him toward an understanding of his queerness. But no, they had to reconcile in front of a crowd so that everyone could clap when they kissed and then sing a \u201cpunk\u201d rendition of \"Run Rudolph Run\" that I simply do not believe was punk.\n\nKelsey: As a sister of a gay brother, you would think she would try harder! I agree!\n\nAlex: He does admit he misses Hugh, which makes me believe that there\u2019s room for this relationship to evolve with time.\n\nSabrina: That\u2019s right, Taylor, it\u2019s never too late to transition!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe movie closes with everyone at a Christmas party together smiling laughing whatever. Boring! Let Matthew kiss Hugh on his wizened old lips! Do you feel like you learned any lessons from this movie?\n\nAlex: I learned that it is impossible to be a present parent and also be successful at your career so you gotta choose one. Classic!\n\nKelsey: A lesson I learned is to never fill your fake belly with only lentils if it is not double lined. You need the lentils to be secure. What lessons did you learn?\n\nSabrina: I learned the lesson of Mamma Mia, which is that you should always tell your daughter about the band you were in when you were younger because it fosters a genuine and lasting connection between the two of you that can also help transfer intergenerational wisdom about financial planning (in this case from Zoey to Taylor). And I learned to never do winter sports without health insurance.",

Or is this just college football fans, and mostly those from the lower right quadrant of the nation, shrieking in glee at said diaper and its owner?\n\nWe're not exactly sure, to be honest, although it says something about the tone of it all that the metaphorical diaper is a constant. Despite its ongoing consolidation into sprawling gigaconferences, college football has never been a more regional sport than it is now, and a large part of the nation that's still invested in the whole Ponzi scheme likes the fact that everyone involved is pantloading in a frantically public way. As big a deal as Notre Dame football is\u2014and it is a big deal, if not quite as big a deal as it believes itself to be\u2014this is more about the chance to giggle and gawk at an embarrassing public spectacle than it is anything to do with the game itself.\n\nBut here we are anyway, on Day 4 of a two-day story, with Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark chastising Bevacqua for complaining about ACC commissioner Jim Phillips' inertia re: the ACC social media team's frantic promotion for the playoff candidacy of full member Miami instead of part member Notre Dame. That's a lot to follow, a proper pigpile of socially arrested suits moaning and groaning about each other. They are upset because their entire system is a Jenga tower wrapped in money and coated in maple syrup; they are complaining because that's more or less their raison d'etre.\n\nNotre Dame has always been an easy target for such fans and opponents because of the advantages it has blackjacked into being. Those include being an independent in the program's most lucrative sport and a conference member in all the others; having its own network; and the recent discovery that they can be grandfathered into the 2026 playoff simply by being ranked in the top 12 by the nitwit-powered playoff committee. Notre Dame is entitled because they are Notre Dame, but it is more salient in this case that the system has re-entitled them. As a result, Notre Dame when wronged is particularly squeally, and those who don't like them for those privileges (read: the rest of College Football America) will naturally be inclined to soak their feet in the bucket of Notre Dame's tears.\n\nBut if it were just that, we could all move on to some other seasonal gripe\u2014the fact that inflatable front yard Santas are not only a thing but a thing that costs $200, maybe. It isn't just that, though. College football is no longer about either college or football. It's certainly not about the players, who used to be student-athletes but now are working their way toward the drinking-age hell of being employees. College football is about itself, and more specifically about the act of consuming itself\u2014about being shouty about something or someone. We suspect that Bevacqua knows this in his way, just as the committee knew it in their context, and Lane Kiffin knew about it in his uniquely hyper-solipsistic way, and LSU knew it when it fired Brian Kelly, then unfired him so they could avoid paying him, then lost their interest in unfiring him when they found out they'd have to pay him anyway and fired him again. You can see this knowledge, which is cynical and sure and absolutely ice cold, in the way that coaches were being fired weekly for Snickers and giggles all season, and in USC and Michigan complaining that Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti is seeking out hedge fund operators to fuel college sports. Everyone knows their respective advantage and what they can get away with, and everyone is pressing their luck.\n\nIt's all adult-on-adult behavior, and the one thing youth culture has always gotten right is how utterly contemptible adults are when left to their own reflections. Commissioners? Athletic directors? Coaches? Hedge funds? How much closer to the bottom of the latrine are we this year than last?\n\nWhatever that distance, this is what college football wants to be now, and so we must presume what it will continue to be. People even hate the comparatively charming presences of Tulane and James Madison in the playoff as the business' last offering to the 100-some-odd schools left out of the SEC/Big Ten appropriation of the levers of power. Those people will likely be proven right, if annoying, when Tulane gets boatraced (again) by the de-Kiffinized Ole Miss and JMU gets pounded by Oregon. Those adults will complain about the playoff format for five days while the Tulane and JMU coaches flit off to their next jobs, and then everyone will get back to the bidness of bidness.\n\nWith all that as the backdrop, Notre Dame re-galvanizing the industry's Pavlovian hate against itself may actually be brilliant if self-parodic theatre, a reminder that, even in this churning mosh pit of soul-deficient moneygrubbers, there is one thing they can all agree upon. We prefer to think, then, that Pete Bevacqua saw the business tearing itself apart and imposed the power incumbent in his office as Chief Petty Officer Of The U.S.S. Fighting Irish to remind everyone of the one thing they can all agree upon\u2014hating Notre Dame for being so relentlessly, persistently and shamelessly Notre Dame. Bevacqua's sacrifice should be hailed as what it is, a brave act of falling on the grenade to save the rest of the platoon. The only real quibble we have is why anyone would bother to take one for this platoon, even or especially when it all just feels like friendly fire.",

Mayhap, I mused, I was not destined for love in this life, at least not the romantic kind, that full-body luminescence conjured when two hearts meet, mingle, and meld. O, the ecstasy of amplexus, are we fated never to touch?\n\nEnough! I can spare no more space in my heart for a vile temptress. Having escaped with everything but my dignity intact, I literally hopped with my proverbial tail betwixt my legs. I hankered for the comfort of home, that old familiar plastic cube in the laboratory, and knew thither I must go. These clinical strictures, which once felt suffocating, now offered me a sense of comfort, how wrapping yourself in a blanket is sometimes the closest you can come to being held.\n\nAnd so my days became humdrum once more. I splayed my webbed toes against the plastic and watched the others do what we frogs are known to do: sit, stare, and haphazardly hop. I felt no love for the beings whose enormous hands dropped mealworms into my cube, but at least the terms of our arrangement were clear and transactional. We each knew what we were getting from each other. I would not awake with horror to find my legs disappeared in their toothy and cavernous jaws.\n\nI became contented with this banal purgatory, the days multiplying like minced planaria. So when a detestable invertebrate was once again dropped without warning into my plastic box, when I heard its loathsome little wings battering the acrylic walls, I turned around without hesitation and opened my mouth to swallow the minibeast. After weeks of mealworms, I was ready for flavor and prepared for significant bodily harm. O wretched ambrosial bug, come into my mouth!\n\nShinji Sugiura\n\nWhen I opened my eyes to see my meal, horror coursed through the cold blood of my veins. I am no stranger to pain. I had survived the barbed penes of the mason wasp and the pestilential nectar of the bombardier beetle. But now I faced a nemesis I feared I could not vanquish. Time wavered as I realized that I now looked upon the northern giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia. Had I not been so hungry, I would have bowed my head in reverence to such a creature. This is the beast some call the murder hornet.\n\nWhat a predicament I have inflicted upon myself! Shinji Sugiura\n\nVerily, good reader, I had heard the horror stories. How its stinger slices through the dense barrier of a beekeeping suit as if it were nothing more than silk. How it slays four score bees a minute, decapitating each worker head by puny head. How a single prick of its venom can kill a mouse. How might the life of a mouse measure up to that of of a frog? The odds, I reasoned, were not in my favor. I thought I had stared Death in his wizened face before, felt his stale breath waft over my mortal soul, but I know now I had never been in any real danger. The mason wasp and bombardier beetle were mere hurdles, a way to test my thirst for the spice of life. But this, it dawned on me, would be my final test. Was this lonely frog ready to die?\n\nO Death, am I ready for your sweet embrace? Shinji Sugiura\n\nOf course I contemplated spitting out the hornet, wrenching it from my lips with the suctioned pads of my forelimbs. Yet my mouth rudely ignored my mind; my jaws clamped together as the creature thrashed in my throat. I thought of many things in these precious seconds that preceded the pain. I thought of my almost-love, my almost-killer. I thought of my youth in Honshu, whose green fields I remember only in dreams. Was it still my homeland, or had my home become this plastic cube? Had the fluorescent overhead lighting become my new sun, and these large-fingered scientists my pantheon of gods? 'Twould not be so bad to die like this, I reasoned, among the closest thing a frog has got to family. No need to mend a broken heart if it stops beating entirely. And so I waited, hornet in my jaws, thinking of my father\u2014had I ever met him, and did he look like me?\u2014and felt the Dreaded Puncture of my supper's stinger slicing through my flesh. Farewell, brutish world!\n\nCome, Reaper, I am ready for your embrace! Shinji Sugiura\n\nI waited, and waited, and waited, and as I waited this dastardly hornet stung me once more on my lip, and then my throat and face, and finally, my eyeball. This is when I began pleading with Death to come more expeditiously. Come Charon, here is my coin! Let me hop with the shades! Through my stung eye, I looked beyond the walls of my box to see if any of my fellow frogs bore witness to my expiration. But none spared me a second glance. My comrades were each in their boxes, munching on hornets of their own, and looking invariably unperturbed. What was the meaning of this? Were we not all put on Earth to die, put specifically in this laboratory to be murdered by way of hornet?\n\nAnd then I swallowed the hornet and felt fine. A cold sheen seeped from my mucus membrane as I realized that I was, against every expectation, going to live. (This also surprised the scientists.)\n\nFrog who is \"going to be okay.\" Shinji Sugiura\n\nIn that moment I understood the devil with which I had danced. I had almost given up the most precious gift a frog can have, because of what, exactly? Some failed romance? I was a fool to search for happiness in others before I could first find happiness in myself.\n\nI may be a frog alone in the world, but this is not such a tragedy. I have my two strong hindlimbs for hopping, my two dexterous forelimbs for pushing giant, wriggling hornets down my gullet. I have eyes that can see despite being repeatedly stung. I have a mind and a soul, one no more or less significant than any of the other beings around me in this lab. I have a story, which I am not ready to end. I am not ready to croak. Bring it on, life, give me more! Give me more taste, more experiences. Give me the moon and the stars! Give me more joy, more love, even more heartache, I am ready for it all! Whatever the webbed fingers of the heavens may throw at me next, I will open my mouth wide to guzzle the rapture and the pain, to be changed by what will change me. You know what I'm getting at. Another hornet, good sir!",

But some of us have more of what I might call a medieval peasant mindset toward a sport that inherently features a whole lot of randomness, and it is becoming clearer with each victory that the Ducks are blessed by some power greater than \"being good at hockey.\" Call it what you like\u2014mojo, juju, puck luck, duck luck, the favor of the Canaanite goddess Astarte\u2014the Ducks have it.\n\nConsider Tuesday's 4-3 shootout victory in Pittsburgh, a showdown of semi-aquatic birds. The Penguins took 47 shots to Anaheim's 28, had five power plays to the Ducks' one, enjoyed 80 percent of the game's high-danger scoring chances, and generally broke the Deserve To Win O'Meter. Yet it was the Ducks who came away with two points\u2014duck, duck, deuce?\u2014for they enjoy the inscrutable blessings of fate and physics.\n\nIt took a pair of miracles to get there, but that's simply the way the puck bounces when things are going good. The first came at the end of regulation\u2014the very, very end. 19:59.9 of the third period, to be precise, when the Ducks, down a goal, down a man but with their goalie pulled, skated in on a Pens defense that looked fairly prepared for the desperation attempt. But rookie Beckett Sennecke was allowed a shocking amount of room to maneuver on net (play the man, not the puck!) and attempted a short pass across the goalmouth that, had things gone according to Sennecke's plan, would have seen time expire. \"I wasn\u2019t really keeping track of the time,\u201d Sennecke admitted.\n\nBut the pass bounced off the hand of a sprawled Erik Karlsson and in, with 0.1 showing on the clock.\n\n\"It hit my hand and went in. There was no question about it,\u201d Karlsson said. \u201cHow it came to be that way, I don't really know.\" Yes! Join me in freeing yourself from the shackles of causality! This is the NHL in December, where nothing makes sense and nothing really matters. The Pens are an inexplicable 1-7 on games that make it to overtime? Sure, why not. The Ducks are 19-10-1, and have won three straight despite being down to their third and fourth goaltenders? Tell another one.\n\nVille Husso, said third-string netminder, is on a very Ducklike heater, in that he's winning game after game despite not playing a very good goal. He's allowed three or more goals in four of six starts since stepping in for the injured Lukas Dostal and Petr Mrazek, and he's 5-1 in those games. A representative bit of Husso magic came in overtime, when Sidney Crosby along the goal line pushed a lovely pass out to Tommy Novak in the opposite circle for the one-timer. An off-balance Husso reached out with his stick ... and didn't get anywhere near it.\n\nIt's tough to see, even on replays, but Novak's shot hit the post and rode up Husso's stick, and he deposited it in an only slightly less dangerous part of the crease, until it was fortuitously cleared away. I'm not sure Husso really did anything here, let alone earned the \"save of the year\" caption, but all that ultimately matters is straightforward enough to be described to a caveman, and puck no go in.\n\nLeo Carlsson's first-round shootout goal stood up, as Husso added three more stops to go with his 44 saves.\n\nHusso has likened the Ducks' hot start\u2014and we're past a third of the way through the season, so this is more than a fluke\u2014to the Blues' Stanley Cup run he enjoyed from the bench in 2019. \"I feel like there\u2019s a lot of similar stuff happening here. The atmosphere and everything. The rink is buzzing. Fans are excited. Everything is just like clicking.\" Do not underestimate the power of buzzing and clicking. Something weird and fun is happening here.\n\n",

If I liked something, I was going to overdo it.\"</p><p>During the event, Van Dyke recalled meeting Walt Disney in the early 1960s. The pioneering animator died in 1966 at age 65 from lung cancer.</p><p>\"He was a wonderful guy,\" said Van Dyke. \"He just smoked too much!\"</p><p><strong>WATCH: \u2018DICK VAN DYKE SHOW\u2019 STAR NEVER BECAME CLOSE WITH MARY TYLER MOORE</strong></p><p>In 1972, Van Dyke checked into a hospital to address his alcoholism, People reported.</p><p>Van Dyke previously told <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WrAvS9BYJw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the \"Really No Really\" podcast</a> that sharing his struggles with alcohol was important to him because he hoped it would help others.</p><p>\"I knew so many people who couldn\u2019t get out of it,\" he said. \"I was in my 30s, and I didn\u2019t drink. I moved to a neighborhood ... where they had parties every Saturday, and I started to drink with them. Before I knew it, I was hung up on this stuff. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Same with smoking.\"</p><p>Van Dyke noted he only drank \"socially,\" never while working or before going to the set. Still, it affected his life when the cameras stopped rolling.</p><p>\"An alcoholic will go from a happy drunk, eventually into a mean drunk and an unhappy guy,\" he said. \"And I was getting testy, and I just hated it.\"</p><p>Still, the \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" actor admitted that quitting smoking was \"twice as hard.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER</u></strong></a></p><p>\"Much worse than the alcohol,\" he shared on the podcast. \"[It took] forever.\"</p><p>In an essay he wrote for <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/dick-van-dyke-at-100-my-secrets-for-a-long-and-healthy-life-kcr7j5s05\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Times U.K.</a> ahead of his birthday, Van Dyke shared that staying active has been key to keeping himself physically strong and mentally sharp. It also lets him pursue his love of dancing.</p><p>\"I still try to hit the gym three times a week,\" he explained. \"I don\u2019t know why this is something I still want to do, but it is. I\u2019m not a \u2018wake up and go back to bed\u2019 type just yet, unless it\u2019s cold and rainy. If I miss too many gym days, I really can feel it \u2014 a stiffness creeping in here and there. If I let that set in, well, God help me.\"</p><p>\"At the gym,\u00a0I usually do a circuit, going from one machine to the next without a break, in a circle,\" he said. \"I start with the sit-up machine. [My wife] Arlene says I could do 500, but that might be exaggerating. Then I do all the leg machines religiously because my legs are two of my most cherished possessions. And then the upper body.\"</p><p>\"The secret ingredient is the music,\" he continued. \"Most of my humming and singing really happens when I\u2019m going from one machine to another. By \u2018going\u2019 I mean dancing. You heard me \u2014 dancing! And if I\u2019m really feeling it, I\u2019m no quiet warbler; I\u2019m a Broadway belter.\"</p><p>While exercise keeps his body moving, it\u2019s love that keeps his heart young.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

Arlene is half my age, and she makes me feel somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters my age \u2014 which is still saying a lot. Every day she finds a new way to keep me up and moving, bright and hopeful and needed.\"</p><p>\"Boiled down, the things that have kept my life joyful and fulfilling are pretty simple: romance, doing what I love and a whole lot of laughing,\" he continued.</p><p>\"Let me show you what that looks like on the ground, as they say.

Julia Coleman, who represents Carver County in southwest Minneapolis, told Fox News Digital.\u00a0</p><p>\"Governor Tim Walz is in charge of making sure that the taxpayers' dollars are protected.\"</p><p>Minneapolis has been at the center of controversy in recent weeks over a massive fraud scheme dating back to at least 2020 that permeated several departments and several nonprofits ranging from childcare services, to COVID-19 relief, to autism care, and is believed by many to eventually eclipse $1 billion in wasted state and federal taxpayer funds.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/schemes-stacked-upon-schemes-1b-human-services-fraud-fuels-scrutiny-of-minnesotas-somali-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>\u2018SCHEMES STACKED UPON SCHEMES\u2019: $1B PUBLIC BENEFITS FRAUD FUELS SCRUTINY OF MINNESOTA\u2019S SOMALI COMMUNITY</strong></a></p><p>\"He had years to stop this,\" Coleman said about Walz, who has\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-derelict-leadership-to-blame-in-1b-fraud-scandal-with-haunting-reminds-of-watergate-gop-challenger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>faced increasing backlash</u></a> for not taking swift action to investigate the fraud.\u00a0He said the governor \"only seems to care now that it\u2019s getting national attention.\"</p><p>State Rep. Mark Koran, who represents Minnesota\u2019s District 28 in eastern Minnesota, told Fox News Digital the \"scale and scope\" of the fraud is \"almost incomprehensible\" and that the buck stops with Walz.\u00a0</p><p><strong>\"</strong>You have to look at who's been solely in charge of that process, which has been Governor Walz,\" Koran said. \"The executive body controls every agency.

And I think they're actually both.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/expert-reveals-key-factor-led-massive-minnesota-fraud-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>EXPERT REVEALS KEY FACTOR THAT LED TO MASSIVE MINNESOTA FRAUD SCHEME</strong></a></p><p>In addition to facing overall blame due to the governor overseeing all the agencies involved in the fraud, Walz has faced criticism for his specific response to the Feeding Our Future scandal, which involves a\u00a0scheme that prosecutors say exploited a federally funded children\u2019s nutrition program administered by the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, siphoning money meant to provide meals to low-income kids.\u00a0</p><p>It now stands as the nation's largest COVID-19 fraud case.</p><p><strong>\"</strong>Minnesota has an epidemic of fraud, as the rest of the nation is learning,\" GOP state Sen. Michael Kreun told Fox News Digital. \"We've known here in Minnesota for quite some time that we've had a massive fraud problem, and it's turning out that probably Minnesota is the epicenter of fraud in the United States right now, which is really unfortunate. And you know, we've been working on a lot of anti-fraud measures, particularly over the last year. Unfortunately, Governor Walz has been fighting us in those efforts.\"</p><p>Kreun, who represents the 32nd District in Anoka County north of Minneapolis, said that while there are many culprits, Walz \"first and foremost has allowed this fraud to happen.\"</p><p><strong>\"</strong>Attorney General Keith Ellison has also been very negligent in his handling of the fraud,\" Kreun explained. \"Seems like most of our social services programs here in Minnesota were basically set up under kind of the honor system, and there have not been a lot of guardrails. And once the fraudsters realized how to exploit these programs, the administration, the Walz administration, hasn't done really anything to put safeguards in place to prevent the fraud that was developing over a number of years.\"</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Republican</a> legislators plan to take action during the next legislative session to implement more oversight of the troubled agencies, Koran told Fox News Digital that many don\u2019t understand the \"challenge\" they face is that the legislature \"doesn\u2019t have any oversight in the execution and operations of these agencies.\"</p><p><strong>\"</strong>The governor has had sole responsibility since the day he's arrived,\" Koran said. \"He entered into a fraudulent environment. He's enhanced the fraudulent environment, and he's not done a single thing to stop that fraud.\"</p><p>A spokesperson from Walz's office pushed back on the lawmakers, saying in a statement to Fox News Digital that Walz \"views addressing fraud as a top priority.\"</p><p>\"Over the last three years, he has made systematic changes to state government,\" the spokesperson said. \"Detecting fraud is resource intensive and time-consuming \u2014 especially when it comes to the federal Medicaid programs that have a complex interplay between federal, state, and county governments and private insurance companies. It is an issue that many states, both red and blue, have faced.\"</p><p>\"That is why we have created additional checks and balances throughout state government. We have hired investigators, auditors, and law enforcement. The Governor has brought in an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs at the Department of Human Services (DHS) and created a specialized fraud-fighting law enforcement unit at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He has installed new leadership at DHS with a single-minded focus on stopping fraudulent payments. Many of the changes have not been flashy or headline-grabbing, but rather just the hard work of building stronger safeguards throughout state government.\"</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Amada Macias contributed to this report.</i></p>",

What you done to us has been immoral. It\u2019s been evil. It\u2019s been unjust. It\u2019s been downright wrong and the only way to bring salvation to America - you gotta pay us what you owe us,\" Haynes said. \"I've come by to say San Francisco, California, Texas, United States of America, if you want salvation to come to this house, you've got to engage in reparations.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/far-left-firebrand-spends-eye-popping-amount-campaign-cash-luxury-hotels-limo-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>FAR-LEFT FIREBRAND SPENDS EYE-POPPING AMOUNT OF CAMPAIGN CASH ON LUXURY HOTELS, 'TOP-TIER' LIMO SERVICES</strong></a></p><p>The remarks were made at the church of failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris' longtime mentor and pastor, Amos Brown, who has made several controversial comments, including <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voice-leadership-harris-has-repeatedly-praised-her-pastor-who-blamed-america-9-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blaming the United States</a> for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p><p>Haynes' comments received high praise from Brown, who told the congregation, \"What a wonder. What a word. What a challenge.\"\u00a0</p><p>He then told all the members of the San Francisco reparations task force in the crowd to \"implement what our preacher has so eloquently stated in undescribable words. I told you you would receive information. You got all the inspiration you need. Now it's time for implementation.\"</p><p>Haynes was also present at a reparations rally outside the White House in 2023, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AnZb9--JRg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">when he said</a> the United States was \"born in the sin of a hostile, genocidal takeover of Indigenous land and shaped by anti-Black White supremacy. This is a country that spent in the aftermath of emancipation decades plundering Black communities and ensuring that we were economically exploited and excluded. And so how could you talk about redemption without reparation?\"</p><p>\"We've come to cash our check because we've seen the [profit and loss] statement,\" he continued.</p><p>In addition to his activism on reparations, Haynes has a history of controversial statements, including <a href=\"https://x.com/fhunscripted/status/941737101552472067?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">posting a photo</a> of himself and notorious antisemite Louis Farrakhan in 2017, calling him a \"wonderful and great man.\" In 2015, Haynes also lavished praise on Farrakhan, saying he was \"a prophetic leader of our time.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, he attacked conservative activist <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/charlie-kirk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Charlie Kirk</a> after his assassination, accusing him of espousing \"dangerous\" views \"rooted in white supremacy.\"</p><p>He criticized characterizations of Kirk\u2019s killing as an assassination, saying, \"a white Christian gets killed, murdered, not assassinated,\" continuing, \"Martin King got assassinated, Malcom X got assassinated, Medgar Evers got assassinated, don\u2019t compare Kirk to King.\"</p><p>Though he condemned political violence, Douglass proceeded to drill into Kirk, saying, \"What Kirk said was dangerous, what Kirk said was racist, rooted in white supremacy, nasty and hate-filled.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-gop-senator-says-crockett-announcement-exposes-how-radical-dems-are-nationwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TOP GOP SENATOR SAYS CROCKETT ANNOUNCEMENT EXPOSES HOW 'RADICAL' DEMS ARE NATIONWIDE</strong></a></p><p>During the same sermon, he proceeded to call out politicians who said America was better than political violence, because, as he said, \"we ain\u2019t better than this.\"</p><p>\"One of the things that gets me, and we got the politicians in here, I\u2019m going to come for you if you ever say this, if you ever say, \u2018America, we better than this,\u2019 you lying, you lying. We ain\u2019t better than this. America was born in political violence.\"</p><p>He proceeded to list a number of acts of violence, saying, \"America committed political violence during the slave trade, America committed political violence when black bodies hung as strange fruit from old southern trees, America committed political violence against the Irish, against the Italians, before they became white.\"</p><p>\"And you going to say, \u2018We better than this?\u2019\" he continued. \"No, we can\u2019t fix what you won\u2019t face, until you look in the mirror and face this is a violent country, that has done violence to too many people.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/social-media-erupts-after-far-left-firebrand-botches-epstein-claim-insane-accusation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS AFTER FAR-LEFT FIREBRAND BOTCHES EPSTEIN CLAIMS: 'INSANE ACCUSATION'</strong></a></p><p>Haynes did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment by the time of publication.</p><p>Though he did not address his congressional campaign, speaking at <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/jasmine-crockett-says-she-doesnt-need-convert-trump-supporters-her-texas-senate-bid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crockett\u2019s Senate launch event</a> on Monday, Haynes accused Republicans of \"racism\" over a recently passed Texas redistricting bill. He praised Crockett, comparing her to the biblical Esther, saying, \"As dark as it is right now, with Jasmine, the light is about to break out and shine.\"</p><p>Crockett has previously praised Haynes, saying he has been a source of guidance for her.</p><p>In a July 2023 social media statement, Crockett wrote, \"I\u2019ve been blessed to know Rev. Dr. Frederick D. Haynes, III for years, and to have been able to turn to him for guidance wherever, whenever.\"</p><p>\"As a PK, as a North Texan, and as a member of Friendship-West Baptist Church, I couldn\u2019t be prouder to watch Pastor Haynes touch even more lives!\" she added.</p><p>Crockett did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment by the time of publication.</p>",

The department pointed out that, as the name implies, only black men are allowed to become \"Black Men Teach\" fellows.</p><p>\"While Defendants claim that these provisions are to stop discrimination, they require Defendants to blatantly discriminate against teachers based on their race, color, sex and national origin,\" the DOJ complaint reads.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-appointed-judge-strikes-down-anti-dei-measures-from-education-department\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGE STRIKES DOWN ANTI-DEI MEASURES FROM EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</strong></a></p><p>The department also claims that MPS documents show the district is aiming to increase the number of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) staff by 40%.

Researchers used the cultured cells to print about 300 transparent implants with Precise Bio's regenerative platform.\u00a0</p><p>Their system builds a layered structure that looks and behaves like a natural cornea.

Many patients in developed countries wait only a few days for a transplant, while others wait years due to low tissue availability. A single donor cornea that can create hundreds of implants changes that equation.\u00a0</p><p>Professor Michael Mimouni, director of the Cornea Unit in the Department of Ophthalmology at Rambam Eye Institute, led the surgical team. He described the moment as unforgettable because the lab-grown implant restored sight to a real patient for the first time.</p><p>He says, \"What this platform shows and proves is that in the lab, you can expand human cells. Then print them on any layer you need, and that tissue will be sustainable and work. We can hopefully reduce waiting times for all kinds of patients waiting for all kinds of transplants.\"</p><p>The procedure is part of an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial that assesses safety and tolerability in people with corneal endothelial disease. This achievement reflects years of work across research labs, operating rooms and industry. It also shows how coordinated teams can push new treatments from concept to clinical reality.</p><p>The breakthrough will have a permanent home in Rambam's upcoming Helmsley Health Discovery Tower. The new Eye Institute will consolidate care, training and research under one roof. It aims to speed the move from emerging science to real-world treatment for patients across Northern Israel and beyond.</p><p>Precise Bio says its <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/3d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3D printing system</a> could eventually support other tissues like cardiac muscle, liver and kidney cells. That future will require long trials and extensive validation, but the path now looks more achievable.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health/popular-weight-loss-drugs-linked-sudden-vision-loss-research-suggests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>POPULAR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS LINKED TO SUDDEN VISION LOSS, RESEARCH SUGGESTS</strong></a></p><p>If corneal disease affects someone in your family, this work brings new hope. Donor tissue may continue to play a role in many regions, but lab-grown implants offer a way to expand access where shortages hold patients back. The success of this first transplant also suggests a future where regenerative medicine supports many types of tissue repair.</p><p>This milestone also shows how long scientific breakthroughs take to reach real patients. The first 3D printed cornea design appeared in 2018 and only now reached human use.

Every newly opened business is Somali.</p><p>Block by block, under the steady gaze of the 1970s brutalist Riverside towers, now populated mostly by Somalis, the neighborhood is losing its old identity and transforming into something that looks more like Africa than Minnesota, aside from the snow, of course.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/inside-little-mogadishu-minnesotas-somali-community-its-push-belonging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>INSIDE \u2018LITTLE MOGADISHU\u2019: MINNESOTA\u2019S BELEAGUERED SOMALI COMMUNITY UNDER A CLOUD OF FRAUD AND TRUMP ATTACKS</u></strong></a></p><p>This is not new in America. Immigrant groups have long come to our nation and chosen to live in isolation with their own customs. The difference here is that the Somali community in Minnesota is also seeking, and gaining, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">political power</a> \u2014 not just in their neighborhood, but also across the state and even the federal government.</p><p>In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/how-misreading-somali-poverty-led-minnesota-its-largest-welfare-scandal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a massive fraud scandal</a> in which perhaps as much as a billion dollars intended to feed hungry kids was allegedly stolen by organizations with very close ties to the Somali community, local residents are starting to feel mounting frustration.</p><p>One man who agreed to go on video told Fox News Digital, \"I mean, I'm concerned, obviously, because there's no real accounting for any of this, and taxes continue to rise.

Americans hungry for fairness will see that on display night after night.\"</p><p>\"Tony is what everyone wants in an evening-news anchor \u2013 authentic, compassionate, unafraid,\" CBS News President Tom Cibrowski said. \"He connects instantly, whether he\u2019s talking with world leaders or with families navigating difficult news in their own backyards.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/gayle-king-speaks-out-amid-reports-shes-exiting-cbs-mornings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>GAYLE KING SPEAKS OUT AMID REPORTS SHE'S EXITING \u2018CBS MORNINGS\u2019</strong></a></p><p>However, Dokoupil's appointment was not met with celebration among pundits outspoken against Israel.</p><p>\"Pro-Israel guy gets top job from new pro-Israel boss and new pro-Israel owner. Surprise!\" former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, now of Zeteo, reacted to a report that previewed Dokoupil's promotion. MSNBC changed its name officially last month to MS NOW.</p><p>\"Bari Weiss named Tony Dokoupil the new CBS Evening News anchor.

Notably, the Race and Culture Unit was gutted this fall as part of layoffs implemented by David Ellison after taking over CBS News' parent company Paramount.</p><p>The New York Post <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/08/media/cbs-tony-dokoupil-offers-regrets-at-teary-staff-meeting-after-grilling-anti-israel-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>also reported</u></a> that Dokoupil expressed regret to staffers at a meeting, with one network insider describing it, \"There were tears.

I think he handled himself and showed the world and modeled what civil discourse is,\" Redstone said amid the fallout. \"He showed that there was accountability, that there is a system of checks and balances, and frankly, I was very proud of the work that he did.\"</p><p>There has been a revolving door as \"CBS Evening News,\" the perpetual third place newscast behind ABC's \"World News Tonight\" and \"NBC Nightly News,\" has struggled to find an anchor to permanently lead the program since Dan Rather's scandal-plagued exit from the anchor desk in 2005. While Rather manned the desk for more than two decades, none of his successors have lasted longer than six years, including Katie Couric, Scott Pelley, Jeff Glor and Norah O'Donnell, who <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/norah-odonnell-exiting-cbs-evening-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stepped down</a> in January 2025 ahead of Dickerson and DuBois' brief stint.</p>",

I grew up in a Communist country, Czechoslovakia. So I know what it looks like and feels like to live in a totalitarian regime where you cannot speak your mind, or worse, put in prison for political opinions. I\u2019m so proud to be an American, but I\u2019m embarrassed for what Trump is doing to our country,\" Navratilova said to begin the video.</p><p>\"I am p----d off as hell about people capitulating to Trump. Whether it's legal firms, schools, politicians, or companies, we are too big to fail. If we stand together but are divided, we fall. And that's what Trump is counting on. Chaos, fear.

And we all matter. As a tennis player, you're used to fighting. You have to fight for every point, and it kind of gives you that backbone. I will not be quiet. Not speaking out equals resignation, and that's just unacceptable. When you leave a totalitarian regime and you come to a freedom-loving country, of course you have to speak up. Speaking out is the patriotic thing to do. When you see something wrong, don\u2019t be afraid. You can find things to make a difference. Democracy is never finished, but my God, we need to fix it.

    "content": "<p>Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, announced he would not seek re-election after a Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-allows-texas-use-trump-pushed-redrawn-congressional-redistricting-map-favoring-republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decision</a> upheld the redline Republicans had drawn through his district, a decision emblematic of the tough calculus Democrats face in the Lone Star State amid a new slate of congressional districts.\u00a0</p><p>Despite his personal loss, Doggett, 79, believes Democrats have a unique reason for optimism: he thinks Republicans have given themselves a vulnerability in their redistricting efforts by basing their rework on the results of the last election \u2014 and that in doing so they may have spread themselves too thin.\u00a0</p><p>\"My overall view is one of cautious optimism that people recognize that the midterm elections began this summer by Trump when he initiated the new redistricting,\" Doggett told Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think there are several state House seats that have become competitive that may not have been competitive last time,\" he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-turns-up-heat-red-state-republicans-blocking-new-congressional-maps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP TURNS UP THE HEAT ON RED-STATE REPUBLICANS BLOCKING NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAPS</strong></a></p><p>The Supreme Court\u2019s affirmation of the new maps cements new political realities in the Lone Star State designed to squeeze five Democrats out of office, and it puts to bed questions about the lawfulness of the change. Although Doggett\u2019s exit makes a Democratic victory in Texas\u2019 37th Congressional District more unlikely and has forced other Democrats like Rep. Marc Veasy, D-Texas, into similar retirement decisions, questions remain about whether those advantages are short-term gains or if Republicans can reliably expect to benefit in years to come.</p><p>Matthew Green, professor of political science at the Catholic University of America, said the new political landscape \u2014 like all gerrymandering efforts \u2014 is an advantage that will change over time.\u00a0</p><p>\"Gerrymandering can have different effects in differing states over time, but in general, partisan gerrymanders tend to \u2018stack the deck\u2019 towards one party or another,\" Green said. \"Texas is potentially unpredictable; Latinos are increasingly swing voters, so it's not clear what the results might be in 2026 and beyond.\"\u00a0</p><p>Like Green, Doggett also pointed to the Latino vote as a particularly large wild card that Texas Republicans will likely have to reckon with. He believes Republican redistricting efforts have assumed that the Latino community in Texas will continue its right-leaning trend of the last election. Latinos make up roughly 40% of the population in Texas, <a href=\"https://naleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2020-Census-Profiles-TX.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">according to data</a> from the 2020 census.</p><p>\"I see incredible engagement by people across ethnic and racial lines. But given the way the Republicans drew these districts, where they said they were basically packing Hispanics in some districts, I think that this could come back to create a problem for them,\" Doggett said.</p><p>In addition to shifting voting patterns among demographics, Doggett pointed out that Trump's messaging on immigration may not play as forcefully among voters as in 2024.</p><p>\"They are fighting the last war, and we're fighting one now, where many people recognize that Trump's promises on affordability and the like are not working. And so I think the immigration issue is not the kind of hammer that he was able to use last time,\" Doggett said.</p><p>Republican strategists responding to those comments said those vulnerabilities exist everywhere.</p><p>\"That's an interesting way to think about it,\" said a strategist familiar with the thinking of Republican candidates in Texas. \"The same case could be made in California or any other state that's redistricting, right? Like in general, [the advantages] are temporary, no matter what the map is.\"\u00a0</p><p>The source said Republicans \u2014 and Democrats in other states \u2014 are all attempting to push advantages they can find as the margin deciding the balance of power on Capitol Hill has continued to shrink in recent years.</p><p>\"You know, the days of having a House majority by more than 10, those are in the rearview mirror. The map is always going to be small, no matter what the redistricting situation is. So redistricting might help people right now, but it's always a game of inches. So there's always going to be a small margin no matter which party holds the House,\" the strategist said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/red-state-moves-forward-trump-backed-push-new-congressional-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>RED STATE MOVES FORWARD ON TRUMP-BACKED PUSH FOR NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAP</strong></a></p><p>Up until the Supreme Court\u2019s decision put the nail in the coffin, Doggett had been prepared to continue his public service.\u00a0</p><p>It was initially unclear if the new maps passed by the Texas Legislature in August would remain in place. Doggett had already announced his intention to retire but put those plans on hold when a lower court froze the implementation of the new maps, citing concerns that the new maps had gerrymandered along the lines of race in its 160-page <a href=\"https://www.texaspolicyresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gov.uscourts.txwd_.1150387.1437.0_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ruling. </a><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/25a608_7khn.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">In its decision</a> on the matter, the Supreme Court wrote that the lower court had unfairly read race-based motives into the legislature\u2019s deliberations.</p><p>\"The District Court failed to honor the presumption of the legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature,\" the Supreme Court said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-allows-texas-use-trump-pushed-redrawn-congressional-redistricting-map-favoring-republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SCOTUS ALLOWS TEXAS TO USE TRUMP-PUSHED REDRAWN CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING MAP FAVORING REPUBLICANS</strong></a></p><p>Doggett\u2019s departure robs Democrats of a storied incumbent with deep ties to the region. Any alternative candidate the party might put up would likely face a harder time against a Republican opponent.\u00a0</p><p>Doggett, who was the first Democrat to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, last won re-election in 2024 with a 74.2%\u201323.6% victory over Republican candidate Jenny Garcia Sharon.</p><p>\"I am most appreciative for the opportunity to have represented our community in public office for most of the last 50 years \u2014 appreciative for the support and encouragement of so many neighbors as well as people from McAllen to San Antonio, from San Marcos to La Grange,\" Doggett wrote in a press release announcing his retirement.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Navy is warning that the United States must treat shipbuilding and weapons production with the urgency of a country preparing for conflict, with Navy Secretary John Phelan declaring that the sea service \"cannot afford to stay comfortable\" as it confronts submarine delays, supply-chain failures and a shipyard system he says is stuck in another era.</p><p>Phelan delivered the blunt message as he launched the service\u2019s new Rapid Capabilities Office \u2014 an organization he says will slash development timelines, hold programs accountable and inject commercial technology into the fleet far faster than the Pentagon\u2019s traditional acquisition system allows.\u00a0</p><p>\"We\u2019re shifting from process to performance,\" Phelan told an audience of defense companies, investors and Navy officials Tuesday in Washington. \"Programs are treated like entitlements. That ends now.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-expedite-nuclear-powered-subs-australia-sit-near-chinas-doorstep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>US TO EXPEDITE NUCLEAR-POWERED SUBS TO AUSTRALIA THAT WILL SIT NEAR CHINA\u2019S DOORSTEP</u></strong></a></p><p>His remarks come as the Navy faces years of criticism from Congress and outside analysts over submarine production delays, chronic maintenance bottlenecks and missed shipbuilding targets \u2014 problems service leaders warn now carry real strategic consequences. China, meanwhile, is racing ahead with heavily automated, AI-enabled shipyards that have allowed Beijing to expand its fleet far faster than the U.S.</p><p>Phelan urged shipyards and program offices to \"act like we\u2019re at war\" when it comes to production and readiness.</p><p>He argued that the Navy's existing acquisition model, in which major programs spend a decade navigating paperwork before reaching the fleet, is no longer viable.\u00a0</p><p>\"Modern weapons systems take 10 years or more to design. You\u2019d never accept that in private markets, and neither will we,\" he said. \"Our adversaries are not slowing down. We must evolve faster.\"\u00a0</p><p>His call for a wartime footing comes as <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>Beijing rapidly modernizes its navy</u></a> and pours AI-driven automation into its shipyards.\u00a0</p><p>Chinese state shipbuilders have spent the past decade building \"smart\" production lines that use machine learning to optimize welding, cut design cycles and predict bottlenecks in real time \u2014 advantages the U.S. industrial base has struggled to match.\u00a0</p><p>The Trump administration has been laser-focused on reversing that trend. China now has more than 230 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States, according to the Office of Naval Intelligence \u2014 a gap officials say underscores how urgently America must overhaul its acquisition system.</p><p>Analysts say China\u2019s ability to push new hulls into the water at a pace that dwarfs American production reflects its aggressive use of AI-assisted hull design, robotic welding and digital-twin modeling. With China experimenting with unmanned and autonomous vessels and accelerating its shipyard output, U.S. officials say the Navy can no longer afford slow decision cycles or yearslong contract delays.</p><p>After his speech, Phelan met with a small group of reporters alongside Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, a software and data company known for its work with U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, to explain one of the most concrete steps the Navy is taking to accelerate production: an AI-powered logistics and manufacturing platform known as <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/innovation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>Ship OS</u></a>. The Navy has awarded a $448 million investment to stand up the system and push AI-enabled tools across public and private shipyards.</p><p>Ship OS is being deployed first across the submarine industrial base \u2014 the most complex and backlogged segment of U.S. shipbuilding \u2014 before expanding to carriers and other platforms. But the effort faces the same challenge that has plagued previous Navy modernization attempts: whether shipyards, suppliers and the service itself can adopt new digital tools quickly enough to produce measurable gains.</p><p>Phelan said some shipyards still rely on processes that \"haven\u2019t changed since the 1980s,\" despite the complexity of modern submarines, which require millions of labor hours and thousands of bespoke parts. Ship OS, he argued, can spot breakdowns months before they halt production lines.\u00a0</p><p>\"Rather than hearing about a problem that day that will stop us, we will know 60, 90, 120, 180 days in advance,\" he said.</p><p>Karp said Ship OS unifies the data scattered across planning, maintenance and inventory systems that often don\u2019t speak to one another. Early tests, he said, have cut planning tasks that previously took 160 hours down to minutes and reduced material-review backlogs from weeks to under an hour.\u00a0</p><p>Asked whether the tool could help recover the Navy\u2019s slipping timeline on the Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine \u2014 now more than a year behind \u2014 Phelan said the system is already identifying opportunities to claw back time.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you want to move from one boat a year to two, the only way to do it is to understand in real time what\u2019s holding you up and what has to be fixed first,\" he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/china-military-reaches-war-footing-new-missile-silos-advanced-ai-warfare-systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CHINA MILITARY REACHES 'WAR FOOTING' WITH NEW MISSILE SILOS AND ADVANCED AI WARFARE SYSTEMS</u></strong></a></p><p>Beyond parts and schedules, Karp said the submarine industrial base is constrained by a shortage of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/manufacturing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>highly specialized labor</u></a> \u2014 a challenge software alone cannot solve.\u00a0</p><p>Submarine welding is so technically demanding that \"it takes more time to teach a welder how to weld on a nuclear submarine than a doctor,\" he said.</p><p>He argued that tools like Ship OS can help close that gap by capturing the knowledge of the Navy\u2019s most experienced craftsmen and making it usable by less-seasoned workers. The system, Karp said, is already enabling workers \"who would otherwise have the ability to do non-complicated welding\" to perform tasks that previously required elite specialists.</p><p>Former congressman and current Palantir head of defense Mike Gallagher said early pilots revealed how much inefficiency had been baked into daily operations. He pointed to repair yards where even routine decisions about what parts to buy were handled manually with whiteboards and scattered spreadsheets.\u00a0</p><p>\"It was entirely manual,\" Gallagher said. \"Now the same process is done in under an hour \u2014 and they\u2019re projecting more than 2,500 planning days a year saved.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/war-department-refocuses-ai-hypersonics-directed-energy-major-strategy-overhaul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>WAR DEPARTMENT REFOCUSES ON AI, HYPERSONICS AND DIRECTED ENERGY IN MAJOR STRATEGY OVERHAUL</u></strong></a></p><p>The Navy has not yet released data showing how widely those gains can be replicated across the industrial base, and similar past initiatives have struggled once programs scale beyond initial test sites.</p><p>The Ship OS initiative also marks a shift in how the Navy intends to hold contractors accountable. Unlike many Pentagon software deals, the effort is structured around measurable results, not billable hours. The Navy says Palantir will receive the full value of the contract only if the system produces documented gains in productivity and output.</p><p>\"You're forcing us to absorb risk,\" Karp said to Phelan. \"We get paid as we perform.\"\u00a0</p><p>Phelan said that approach will become the model for how the service evaluates new systems. \"We will tell you quickly what works and what doesn\u2019t,\" he said. \"If technology doesn\u2019t deliver, we will say so fast. And if it does perform, we will scale it just as fast.\"</p><p>\"The character of warfare is changing,\" Phelan said. \"We cannot afford to stay comfortable.\"</p>",

Take the History Seminar 506:401,\" says a graphic posted on the Rutgers University history department's Instagram page. One seminar, simply called Communism, will be taught by Mark Bray.</p><p>Bray was at the center of controversy in October, when the Rutgers Turning Point USA chapter started a petition to oust him from his position. The professor is also the author of \"Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook,\" which calls for \"<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/antifa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">militant anti-fascism</a>.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/rutgers-chancellor-launches-safety-review-academic-freedom-task-force-amid-dr-antifa-uproar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>RUTGERS CHANCELLOR LAUNCHES SAFETY REVIEW, \u2018ACADEMIC FREEDOM\u2019 TASK FORCE AMID \u2018DR ANTIFA\u2019 UPROAR</strong></a></p><p>Bray wrote in the book that \"at the very least 50 percent of author proceeds will go to the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund which is administered by more than three hundred antifa from eighteen countries,\" sparking accusations that he helped fund Antifa, which is now designated by the United States government as a domestic terror organization.</p><p>As the petition grew and his ties to Antifa were reported on a large scale, Bray said he was doxxed and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/columbia-professors-rally-behind-antifa-aligned-rutgers-professor-mark-bray\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fled with his wife to Spain</a>. \"Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook,\" presents doxxing as an acceptable method to fight fascism.</p><p>History seminars at Rutgers boast small class sizes \u2014 a maximum of 15 students \u2014 and require a substantial research paper in order to obtain three course credits.</p><p>\"Each semester the History department offers dozens of different seminars covering a wide array of chronological periods and geographical areas,\" the Rutgers history department's <a href=\"https://history.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/courses/history-seminar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">webpage says</a>. \"Some seminars focus on a particular war, cultural movement, or social group, while others focus on an entire century, nation, or broad transnational themes such as biography or global health. Faculty select their seminar topics based on their expertise as research historians.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/campus-radicals\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE CAMPUS RADICALS COAST TO COAST</strong></a></p><p>Bray is also scheduled to teach a March 6, 2025, seminar on \"Fascism and Nazism,\" according to <a href=\"https://rcha.rutgers.edu/high-school-teachers-institute/2025-2026-seminar-schedule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">another webpage</a>.</p><p>\"This Seminar will explore the history, politics, and ideology of fascism and Nazism,\" the description says. \"We will analyze the evolution of the regimes of Mussolini and Hitler, the ideas that propelled their populist authoritarianism, and the lamentably lasting impact of their destructive examples on white supremacist movements for generations to come.\"</p><p>As of October, Bray was teaching online from overseas.</p><p>Neither Rutgers nor Bray responded to a request for comment.</p>",

Nobody will read it<p>2. don't read your slides to the audience. The audience can read<p>3. don't talk with your back to the audience<p>4. make your font as big as practical<p>5. 3 bullet points is ideal<p>6. add a picture now and then<p>7. don't bother with a copyright notice on every slide. It gets really old. Besides, you want people to steal your presentation!<p>8. avoid typing in code as part of the presentation, most of the time it won't work and it's boring watching somebody type<p>9. render the presentation as a pdf file, so any device can display it<p>10. email a copy of your presentation to the conference coordinator beforehand, put a copy on your laptop, and phone, and on a usb stick in your pocket. Arriving at the show without your presentation can be very embarrassing!<p>11. the anxiety goes away<p>12. don't worry about it. You're not running for President! Just have some fun with it</p>\n",

For example, anyone can deploy and run a Debian-based <a\nhref=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres\">PostgreSQL container</a> \non a Fedora&#160;Linux host. <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/\">Distrobox</a> is a project that is designed to\nbring the cross-distribution compatibility to the desktop and allow users to\nmix-and-match Linux distributions without fussing with dual-booting, virtual\nmachines, or multiple computers. It is an ideal way to install\nadditional software on image-based systems, such as Fedora's <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/\">Atomic Desktops</a>\nor <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1046228/\">Bazzite</a>, and also\nprovides a convenient way to move a development environment or\nfavorite applications to a new system.</p>\n\n<p>Distrobox creator Luca Di Maio <a\nhref=\"https://fedoramagazine.org/run-distrobox-on-fedora-linux/\">was\ninspired</a> by the <a href=\"https://containertoolbx.org/doc/\">Toolbx</a>\nproject (formerly Container Toolbox) for Fedora. Generally, the idea with Linux\ncontainers is to run processes in their own environment to isolate them as much\nas possible from the host without having to resort to virtual machines\nwith their additional overhead. It is possible, though, to set up a container to give it privileged\naccess to the system with little to no isolation. This is typically referred to\nas a <a\nhref=\"https://www.baeldung.com/linux/privileged-container-capabilities#privileged-containers\">privileged\ncontainer</a>.\nIt is possible to set up privileged containers manually, but it requires the\nuser to know a great deal about working with containers and some fairly involved\nsetup. The original goal for Toolbx was to let users run a privileged container\n\"toolbox\" on image-based systems that could be used for system administration\nand troubleshooting without having to include administration utilities in the\nimage itself.</p>\n\n<p>Toolbx has a somewhat limited scope: it works best with specific container images and was primarily developed to provide a software toolbox for\nimage-based Fedora editions like <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/\">CoreOS</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/\">Silverblue</a>. Toolbx is also\nlimited to the <a href=\"https://podman.io/\">Podman</a> container manager, which\nis not ideal for those who prefer to use <a\nhref=\"https://www.docker.com/get-started/\">Docker</a>. Di Maio wanted to have\nbroader compatibility with other Linux distributions as host operating systems\nas well as the ability to use a wide range of container images. He published the\nfirst release, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.0.0\">Distrobox&#160;1.0.0</a>,\nin December&#160;2021, under the GPLv3.</p>\n\n<p>The Distrobox project is, as its homepage notes, \"<q>a fancy\nwrapper</q>\" that works with Docker and Podman, with di Maio's own minimal\ncontainer manager, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/lilipod?tab=readme-ov-file#lilipod\">Lilipod</a>,\nas a fallback if the others are not present. Distrobox is written in POSIX\nshell, so that it is as portable as possible. The <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#aims\">project's\nprimary goal</a> is to allow the use of any Linux distribution containers on any\nLinux distribution host running one of the supported container managers. It also\nhas a goal of entering a container as quickly as possible, \"<q>every millisecond\nadds up if you use the container as your default environment for your\nterminal</q>\".</p>\n\n<p>Di&#160;Maio notes in the project's README that isolation and\nsandboxing of applications are non-goals: \"<q>on the contrary it aims\nto tightly integrate the container with the host</q>\". This means that\ncontainers run by Distrobox have access to the user's home directory, external\nstorage, USB devices, audio devices, and more. The idea of a sandboxed\nmode for Distrobox <a href=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28\">was\ndiscussed</a> but di&#160;Maio ultimately <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28#issuecomment-2408529939\">decided\nagainst</a> implementing one and has <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/pull/1806#issuecomment-3219301182\">opted\nnot to take patches</a> attempting to add isolation features: \"<q>the focus of\ndistrobox is not isolation, security or stuff, but integration and transparency\nwith the host</q>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\n\n<p>Distrobox is packaged for most popular Linux distributions, and the project\nhas a <a href=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#host-distros\">compatibility\ntable of host distributions</a> for those it has been tested on. The table \nhas notes with additional instructions if necessary. There is a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#containers-distros\">table of guest\ndistributions</a> as well that lists the container images that have been successfully\ntested with Distrobox. If a distribution is not mentioned in the host or guest\ntable it does not mean that Distrobox will not work; it simply indicates that\nthe combinations have not been tested. Users will also need one of the supported\ncontainer managers installed as well.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of how and why one might use Distrobox: the <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/#signal\">Signal</a> project only provides <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/download/linux/\">packages for Debian-based\ndistributions</a>, so there are no official packages for Arch, Fedora, openSUSE,\nor other non-Debian systems. There is a Flatpak available, but\nit is not maintained by the Signal project itself. It is possible to \ncompile Signal from source, but it is far easier to create a Debian Distrobox and\ninstall the official Signal package there:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox create -i debian:trixie -n signal -H ~/distrobox/signal\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox enter signal\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first command tells <tt>distrobox</tt> to create a new\ncontainer using the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> image with its home directory set to\n<tt>~/distrobox/signal</tt>, and to name it \"signal\". If the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> container image is not already present on the\nsystem, Distrobox will ask if you want to download it. Note that\nDistrobox uses the system's settings for short-name container\nlookup; it is also possible to pass the full registry path to\n<tt>distrobox</tt> if one prefers. The second command tells it to\nopen a shell inside the container (or <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-enter/\">enter</a> the container) so\none can work within its environment.</p>\n\n<p>All of that will probably look quite\nfamiliar to folks who work with Linux containers regularly, but\nDistrobox is doing quite a bit more behind the scenes. The\n\"<tt>--dry-run</tt>\" (or <span class=\"nobreak\">just \"<tt>-d</tt>\"</span>) option will print out the\ncommand that \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox create</tt></span>\" is\npassing to the container manager for inspection, without taking any\nactions. It's worth eyeballing the output to see what goes into\nsetting up a container that's well-integrated with the host system. In\nthe case of the example command here, there are more than 50 options\npassed to <tt>podman</tt>, including 17 volume mounts. That is a lot\nof container magic that the user is not required to fuss with or know\nabout, unless they want to.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things it does is to set up passwordless <tt>sudo</tt>\ninside the container, so one can immediately install packages in the container and so\nforth. Note that, by default, Distrobox executes the user's login\nshell when entering a container, but <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/useful_tips/#use-a-different-shell-than-the-host\">this\ncan be changed</a> if one wants to use (say) the Fish shell on the\nhost system but GNU Bash inside a Distrobox container.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of setting a home directory is not to provide isolation from the\nuser's home directory, but to avoid clutter. If no home directory is specified,\nthe guest container will <span class=\"nobreak\">use <tt>~/</tt></span>; that may be undesirable if one wants\nto maintain a separate set of configuration files or project directories in a\nDistrobox. Applications and processes in the Distrobox will still be able to\naccess files under the user's normal home directory. For example, if\nDistrobox container is set up with its home as\n<tt>/home/user/distrobox/signal</tt> then that will be set as\n<tt>$HOME</tt> for applications within the container. However, the\napplications can still access files in <tt>/home/user</tt>,\n<tt>/home/user/Documents</tt>, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>The <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-create/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;create</tt></a>\nman page provides a number of useful examples to help getting\nstarted. The \"<tt>distrobox&#160;create&#160;-C</tt>\" command will provide a\ncurrent list of images that are considered compatible with Distrobox. If a\ncontainer image is not listed as compatible, that does not mean it won't work,\njust that it has not been tested and confirmed to work.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, Distroboxes can be destroyed as well as created: \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox rm\n<em>name</em></tt></span>\" will remove a container. That does <em>not</em>,\nhowever, remove the container image from the system. If the goal is to\ncompletely purge the container image as well, then it's necessary to use the\ncontainer manager to do so, e.g. \"<tt>podman&#160;rmi&#160;<em>imagename</em></tt>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Exporting applications and moving containers</h4>\n\n<p>Since Distrobox is often used to run desktop applications, it does not make\nsense to have to enter the Distrobox container each time one wants to run Signal or some\nother application. The project provides a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-export/\">distrobox-export</a> command that sets\nup a <tt>.desktop</tt> file to launch the command directly from one's\ndesktop. For example, this will create a launcher for the Signal desktop client:\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox-export --app signal-desktop\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that the command should be run from within the container\ncreated by Distrobox, not on the host. Assuming that\nthe user is running a desktop environment like GNOME, KDE, or Xfce, an entry for\nSignal should show up in whatever menu or launcher is being used. Now it's not\nnecessary to use \"<tt>distrobox&#160;enter</tt>\" at all to run Signal, it can be\nrun like any other desktop application that is installed on the\nhost. Even though Distrobox prioritizes speed in starting containers,\nthere is usually a small but noticeable lag when launching an application from\na container that hasn't started yet.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, one might want to use a Distrobox container as their\nprimary command-line environment. Some terminal emulators, such as <a\nhref=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis#ptyxis-your-container-oriented-terminal-for-gnome\">Ptyxis</a>,\noffer integration with Distrobox and other container tools; a user can\nset Ptyxis to open new terminal windows in the container\nautomatically. This is particularly handy on image-based systems where\none cannot install software directly on the host using APT or DNF. I\nset Ptyxis to use a Fedora container by default and do my work in the\ncontainer and install additional software therein. To distinguish\nbetween working in the host terminal and in my default container, I\nset the color palette to \"Borland\" from the <a\nhref=\"https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/\">Gogh</a> set of color schemes\nfor terminals. The old-school look is appealing, and I don't get it\nconfused with the black-on-green theme for regular terminals.</p>\n\n<p>The \"<a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-assemble/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt></a>\"\ncommand can automate the creation of one or more Distroboxes. It takes\nan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">INI file</a> with\nspecifications on how to create a new container or multiple\ncontainers. For example, this is a simple <tt>distrobox.ini</tt> that\nwould create a container using a Fedora Rawhide image with several\npackages that I use regularly. The <tt>pull=true</tt> option tells\n<tt>distrobox</tt> to go ahead and pull the container image if it is\nnot available on the system.</p>\n\n<pre>\n    [rawhide]\n    additional_packages=\"emacs emacs-pgtk aerc tmux git lolcat bat\"\n    image=fedora:rawhide\n    pull=true\n    home=/home/jzb/distrobox/rawhide\n</pre>\n\n<p>Jorge Castro has written a <a\nhref=\"https://www.ypsidanger.com/declaring-your-own-personal-distroboxes/\">good\nblog post</a> on using \"<tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt>\" that is\nworth reading for anyone using Distrobox.</p>\n\n<p>The project is not on a time-based schedule, so releases are\nsomewhat sporadic. There is also no roadmap to follow for future\nreleases. Generally, Distrobox seems mostly feature complete, so\nnew versions seem to be mostly about bug fixes or catching up to\nchanges in Linux distributions and container tooling. The most recent\nfeature release was <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.0\">version&#160;1.8.2.0</a>\non October&#160;28 which included Bash completion enhancements, added\nsupport for new guest distributions, and included quite a few\ndocumentation changes as well as bug fixes. With that release,\ndi&#160;Maio also announced the addition of Alessio Biancalana as a\nmaintainer, and Biancalana has headed up the recent minor\nreleases. The most recent is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.2\">1.8.2.2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project does not, unfortunately, have a mailing list or even a web forum:\nthe documentation points users to a <a\nhref=\"https://matrix.to/#/%23distrobox:matrix.org\">Matrix room</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://t.me/distrobox_chat_new\">Telegram group</a> instead. Users\ninterested in making contributions or reporting bugs should check <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\"><tt>CONTRIBUTING.md</tt></a>\nfor guidance.</p>\n\n<p>I've found Distrobox to be enormously useful for providing an easy and quick\nway to run multiple distributions on a single system. Distrobox is probably one\nof my most-used applications after Firefox and Emacs. Multiple versions of Alpine Linux,\nCentOS&#160;Stream, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and others are just a few\nkeystrokes away any time I need them.</p>\n\n</p>",

The idea of a sandboxed\nmode for Distrobox <a href=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28\">was\ndiscussed</a> but di&#160;Maio ultimately <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28#issuecomment-2408529939\">decided\nagainst</a> implementing one and has <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/pull/1806#issuecomment-3219301182\">opted\nnot to take patches</a> attempting to add isolation features: \"<q>the focus of\ndistrobox is not isolation, security or stuff, but integration and transparency\nwith the host</q>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\n\n<p>Distrobox is packaged for most popular Linux distributions, and the project\nhas a <a href=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#host-distros\">compatibility\ntable of host distributions</a> for those it has been tested on. The table \nhas notes with additional instructions if necessary. There is a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#containers-distros\">table of guest\ndistributions</a> as well that lists the container images that have been successfully\ntested with Distrobox. If a distribution is not mentioned in the host or guest\ntable it does not mean that Distrobox will not work; it simply indicates that\nthe combinations have not been tested. Users will also need one of the supported\ncontainer managers installed as well.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of how and why one might use Distrobox: the <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/#signal\">Signal</a> project only provides <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/download/linux/\">packages for Debian-based\ndistributions</a>, so there are no official packages for Arch, Fedora, openSUSE,\nor other non-Debian systems. There is a Flatpak available, but\nit is not maintained by the Signal project itself. It is possible to \ncompile Signal from source, but it is far easier to create a Debian Distrobox and\ninstall the official Signal package there:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox create -i debian:trixie -n signal -H ~/distrobox/signal\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox enter signal\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first command tells <tt>distrobox</tt> to create a new\ncontainer using the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> image with its home directory set to\n<tt>~/distrobox/signal</tt>, and to name it \"signal\". If the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> container image is not already present on the\nsystem, Distrobox will ask if you want to download it. Note that\nDistrobox uses the system's settings for short-name container\nlookup; it is also possible to pass the full registry path to\n<tt>distrobox</tt> if one prefers. The second command tells it to\nopen a shell inside the container (or <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-enter/\">enter</a> the container) so\none can work within its environment.</p>\n\n<p>All of that will probably look quite\nfamiliar to folks who work with Linux containers regularly, but\nDistrobox is doing quite a bit more behind the scenes. The\n\"<tt>--dry-run</tt>\" (or <span class=\"nobreak\">just \"<tt>-d</tt>\"</span>) option will print out the\ncommand that \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox create</tt></span>\" is\npassing to the container manager for inspection, without taking any\nactions. It's worth eyeballing the output to see what goes into\nsetting up a container that's well-integrated with the host system. In\nthe case of the example command here, there are more than 50 options\npassed to <tt>podman</tt>, including 17 volume mounts. That is a lot\nof container magic that the user is not required to fuss with or know\nabout, unless they want to.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things it does is to set up passwordless <tt>sudo</tt>\ninside the container, so one can immediately install packages in the container and so\nforth. Note that, by default, Distrobox executes the user's login\nshell when entering a container, but <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/useful_tips/#use-a-different-shell-than-the-host\">this\ncan be changed</a> if one wants to use (say) the Fish shell on the\nhost system but GNU Bash inside a Distrobox container.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of setting a home directory is not to provide isolation from the\nuser's home directory, but to avoid clutter. If no home directory is specified,\nthe guest container will <span class=\"nobreak\">use <tt>~/</tt></span>; that may be undesirable if one wants\nto maintain a separate set of configuration files or project directories in a\nDistrobox. Applications and processes in the Distrobox will still be able to\naccess files under the user's normal home directory. For example, if\nDistrobox container is set up with its home as\n<tt>/home/user/distrobox/signal</tt> then that will be set as\n<tt>$HOME</tt> for applications within the container. However, the\napplications can still access files in <tt>/home/user</tt>,\n<tt>/home/user/Documents</tt>, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>The <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-create/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;create</tt></a>\nman page provides a number of useful examples to help getting\nstarted. The \"<tt>distrobox&#160;create&#160;-C</tt>\" command will provide a\ncurrent list of images that are considered compatible with Distrobox. If a\ncontainer image is not listed as compatible, that does not mean it won't work,\njust that it has not been tested and confirmed to work.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, Distroboxes can be destroyed as well as created: \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox rm\n<em>name</em></tt></span>\" will remove a container. That does <em>not</em>,\nhowever, remove the container image from the system. If the goal is to\ncompletely purge the container image as well, then it's necessary to use the\ncontainer manager to do so, e.g. \"<tt>podman&#160;rmi&#160;<em>imagename</em></tt>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Exporting applications and moving containers</h4>\n\n<p>Since Distrobox is often used to run desktop applications, it does not make\nsense to have to enter the Distrobox container each time one wants to run Signal or some\nother application. The project provides a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-export/\">distrobox-export</a> command that sets\nup a <tt>.desktop</tt> file to launch the command directly from one's\ndesktop. For example, this will create a launcher for the Signal desktop client:\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox-export --app signal-desktop\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that the command should be run from within the container\ncreated by Distrobox, not on the host. Assuming that\nthe user is running a desktop environment like GNOME, KDE, or Xfce, an entry for\nSignal should show up in whatever menu or launcher is being used. Now it's not\nnecessary to use \"<tt>distrobox&#160;enter</tt>\" at all to run Signal, it can be\nrun like any other desktop application that is installed on the\nhost. Even though Distrobox prioritizes speed in starting containers,\nthere is usually a small but noticeable lag when launching an application from\na container that hasn't started yet.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, one might want to use a Distrobox container as their\nprimary command-line environment. Some terminal emulators, such as <a\nhref=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis#ptyxis-your-container-oriented-terminal-for-gnome\">Ptyxis</a>,\noffer integration with Distrobox and other container tools; a user can\nset Ptyxis to open new terminal windows in the container\nautomatically. This is particularly handy on image-based systems where\none cannot install software directly on the host using APT or DNF. I\nset Ptyxis to use a Fedora container by default and do my work in the\ncontainer and install additional software therein. To distinguish\nbetween working in the host terminal and in my default container, I\nset the color palette to \"Borland\" from the <a\nhref=\"https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/\">Gogh</a> set of color schemes\nfor terminals. The old-school look is appealing, and I don't get it\nconfused with the black-on-green theme for regular terminals.</p>\n\n<p>The \"<a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-assemble/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt></a>\"\ncommand can automate the creation of one or more Distroboxes. It takes\nan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">INI file</a> with\nspecifications on how to create a new container or multiple\ncontainers. For example, this is a simple <tt>distrobox.ini</tt> that\nwould create a container using a Fedora Rawhide image with several\npackages that I use regularly. The <tt>pull=true</tt> option tells\n<tt>distrobox</tt> to go ahead and pull the container image if it is\nnot available on the system.</p>\n\n<pre>\n    [rawhide]\n    additional_packages=\"emacs emacs-pgtk aerc tmux git lolcat bat\"\n    image=fedora:rawhide\n    pull=true\n    home=/home/jzb/distrobox/rawhide\n</pre>\n\n<p>Jorge Castro has written a <a\nhref=\"https://www.ypsidanger.com/declaring-your-own-personal-distroboxes/\">good\nblog post</a> on using \"<tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt>\" that is\nworth reading for anyone using Distrobox.</p>\n\n<p>The project is not on a time-based schedule, so releases are\nsomewhat sporadic. There is also no roadmap to follow for future\nreleases. Generally, Distrobox seems mostly feature complete, so\nnew versions seem to be mostly about bug fixes or catching up to\nchanges in Linux distributions and container tooling. The most recent\nfeature release was <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.0\">version&#160;1.8.2.0</a>\non October&#160;28 which included Bash completion enhancements, added\nsupport for new guest distributions, and included quite a few\ndocumentation changes as well as bug fixes. With that release,\ndi&#160;Maio also announced the addition of Alessio Biancalana as a\nmaintainer, and Biancalana has headed up the recent minor\nreleases. The most recent is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.2\">1.8.2.2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project does not, unfortunately, have a mailing list or even a web forum:\nthe documentation points users to a <a\nhref=\"https://matrix.to/#/%23distrobox:matrix.org\">Matrix room</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://t.me/distrobox_chat_new\">Telegram group</a> instead. Users\ninterested in making contributions or reporting bugs should check <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\"><tt>CONTRIBUTING.md</tt></a>\nfor guidance.</p>\n\n<p>I've found Distrobox to be enormously useful for providing an easy and quick\nway to run multiple distributions on a single system. Distrobox is probably one\nof my most-used applications after Firefox and Emacs. Multiple versions of Alpine Linux,\nCentOS&#160;Stream, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and others are just a few\nkeystrokes away any time I need them.</p>\n\n</p>",

    "content": "First, let me clarify that I think the CFP selections were ultimately as fair as they can be. If they had omitted either Bama or Miami, those teams would have just as big a gripe as Notre Dame, if not more so.\n\nThat said, I think fans are underestimating how big a role the broadcast partners play in shaping the entire landscape of college football. The networks are the ones paying the hundreds of millions of dollars for broadcast rights and therefore ultimately determine the outcome of things like conference realignment decisions. Likewise, they have a huge role in things like bowl selection as well. After all, the vast majority of the bowls have their broadcast rights with ESPN. So, whenever there is discretion in team selection as opposed to an auto-bid, the network has some influence based on the match-ups they prefer to air.\n\nGiven this reality, it sure looks like ESPN put their thumb on the scale and attempted to influence the CFP committee to take Bama and Miami over Notre Dame.\n\nFirst, consider that ESPN (and their parent company Disney/Warner Bros/Discovery which also owns ABC and TNT) has the broadcast rights for both the ACC (Miami) and the SEC (Bama), and ESPN is the network that also has the broadcast rights for the CFP. Notre Dame however has their broadcast rights with a competitor, NBC, who has no role in airing the CFP.\n\nThen consider the sequence of events. For weeks, Notre Dame was ranked ahead of both Bama and Miami, not only in the CFP poll, but in the AP poll, the coaches poll, and all of the computer rankings. They ALL had Notre Dame ranked first among that trio. But the CFP poll changed their rankings over the final two weeks. First, after Bama barely survived against Auburn on the same day that Notre Dame beat Stanford by more than 4 TDs, the CFP put Bama ahead of Notre Dame. Then, a week later, they put Miami ahead even though neither team played a game.\n\nAnd consider that ESPN specifically conducted a campaign to boost Miami's chances by repeatedly airing the Miami vs. Notre Dame game in a 24-hour marathon on the ACC Network on the Thursday and Friday before the final selections were made Saturday night.\n\nGranted, we'll never know for sure how much influence ESPN actually had in getting the committee to change their mind, but it's not exactly a \"conspiracy theory\" to suggest that they were clearly trying to get their broadcast partners into the tournament that they'd be airing.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of comments about ratings, but it's about promoting the teams that are their broadcast partners.\n\nAsk yourself why College Gameday was at the SEC Championship instead of the #1 vs. #2 game between Ohio State and Indiana. The Big Ten game got higher TV ratings, but that game was on Fox. So, they went to Atlanta and promoted their own game.",

    "content": "Not sure if there is a better place to post this. Just watched this movie for the first time actually and was immediately hooked by the concept and world building. Theres some cool parallels to draw with our world, and commentary to be made about capitalism and wealth inequality.\n\nEveryone in their world stops aging at 25 and uses their lifespan as currency. The poor struggle to even stay alive while the rich gamble and waste away decades. At the same time, people are still vulnerable to random acts of violence, so violence and robbery becomes rampant.\n\nThe movie starts off pretty strong and has a lot of positives I think, but it starts to fall apart later on. Lots of interesting concepts get brought up (a wealthy man at the beginning talks about being old enough to crave death, the poor do everything as quick as possible to make the most of time, and there are \"timekeeper\" cops to enforce rigid structure to the society).\n\nBut the movie never fully explains more from there, and then turns generic. Amanda Seyfrieds character is a rich man's daughter who almost immediately falls in love with the protagonist and joins his fight against the system. They fight the system by randomly robbing banks and distributing time.\n\nCillian Murphy also plays the main Timekeeper cop, but is oddly overzealous about enforcing a bizarrely shitty system. Hes shown to have an insane amount of loyalty to the rigid class structure *despite being born and raised in the ghetto*. He \"made it out\" somehow, but then devotes his life to making sure others don't, and then dies from it because he was still pretty damn poor as a cop.\n\nOverall still an interesting watch but just wish we got a lot more. Background on the system and more explanations would have been way better than a generic love story and cookie cutter standoff.\n\nIts been a while since this came out, but anyone else think similar?\n\n\n",

That's something, she claimed, that \"China wasn't doing under the last administration because they had no respect for President [Joe] Biden or for the country at the time.\"</p> <p>That echoed what Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlwh8i70q-c\">said</a> during Monday's announcement of the bailout, when he claimed that \"we inherited a total mess from the Biden administration,\" which \"came in and ruined everything.\"</p> <p>Regardless of your views on how the Biden administration handled the economy, inflation, or any number of other issues\u2014or how you feel about Trump continuing to heap blame on Biden more than a year after defeating him in the election\u2014this specific claim stretches credulity. More than that, it reflects a broader problem with Trump's trade policies, which tie farmers' fates to the occupant of the White House. Shouldn't farmers be able to depend on global export markets without waiting for the American president and his Chinese counterpart to strike a deal?</p> <p>Let's start with the facts on the soybean trade.</p> <p>Since 2017, America has exported more than 22 million metric tons of soybeans to China in <a href=\"https://x.com/ericadyork/status/1998397186111848897\">every year except two</a>. Those years? The first was 2018, when China cut off purchases of American soybeans in response to Trump's tariffs targeting American imports of Chinese goods. The second was this year, when China did the same thing in response to another set of <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/14/the-trump-administration-finally-admits-that-tariffs-raise-prices/\">tariffs</a> imposed by the Trump administration.</p> <p>In short, it is plainly untrue that China was not buying American soybeans during the Biden administration. During those four years, America consistently exported more than 26 million metric tons of soybeans to China.</p> <figure class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8360421\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8360421\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/SoybeanExports.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"531\" data-credit=\"Source: Erica York, Tax Foundation (https://x.com/ericadyork/status/1998397186111848897)\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SoybeanExports.jpg 889w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SoybeanExports-300x266.jpg 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SoybeanExports-768x680.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption>Source: Erica York, Tax Foundation (https://x.com/ericadyork/status/1998397186111848897)</figcaption></figure> <p>In comparison, the deal that Trump recently struck with Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/china-buys-us-soybeans-trump-trade-agreement.html\">calls</a> for China to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of soybeans annually. Yes, that means the deal Trump has hailed as \"<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5580745-trump-china-soybeans/\">tremendous</a>\" would result in American farmers selling less than half as many soybeans as they did during the Biden years.</p> <p>And even that total is unlikely to materialize. Both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/china-buys-us-soybeans-trump-trade-agreement.html\">recently tempered</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/09/trump-trade-rep-changes-china-soybean-purchase-timeline-cites-discrepancy.html\">those expectations</a>, with both saying that the purchases will be completed by the end of February.</p> <p>Try as they might, there is simply no way for the Trump administration to dodge the unavoidable conclusion here: The president's trade war has had significant and damaging consequences for American farmers (and <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/04/american-manufacturing-needs-relief-from-trumps-tariffs/\">manufacturers</a> and <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/28/trumps-1-1-billion-tax-hike-on-toys-and-games/\">consumers</a>), just like it did during his first term. If Trump really wanted to aid farmers, he would ditch the tariffs rather than offering false excuses and a taxpayer-funded bailout.</p> <p>In a broader way, the soybean situation ought to raise some troubling questions about the White House's view of the world and the role of free trade. Trump believes that foreign countries, most especially China, are taking advantage of the United States because we buy more stuff from them than they buy from us\u2014<a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/08/trumps-tariffs-fail-their-own-test/\">that's the \"trade deficit\"</a> that the president and his allies talk about so much. The remedy to this perceived problem, Trump believes, is higher tariffs on foreign goods.</p> <p>As the soybean saga makes clear, tariffs do not exist in a vacuum\u2014and raising barriers to imports <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/blog/import-tariffs-affect-exports/\">can also affect America's exports</a> in a bunch of ways. One <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w26611\">study</a> conducted in the wake of Trump's 2018 tariff increases found that a quarter of American exporters were subject to retaliatory tariff increases. Bigger exporters were more likely to be harmed\u2014and American agriculture is a huge, export-heavy industry. It makes perfect sense that farmers are hurting again now.</p> <p>It turns out that trade isn't really something that happens between countries, but rather between people (who might happen to be in different countries). Trump's conception of trade requires centralization\u2014deals between leaders who decide how much of which products will flow from one place to another.</p> <p>But trade works best when it is decentralized. That is, when farmers in America and factories in China can meet demand in the other country without needing political officials to order or condone the transactions. The best thing that political leaders can do is get out of the way.\u00a0Unfortunately, Trump is doing the exact opposite.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/trump-says-china-didnt-buy-soybeans-while-biden-was-president-heres-what-the-data-show/\">Trump Says China Didn&#039;t Buy Soybeans While Biden Was President.

    "content": "<p>From Friday's order by Judge William Ray (N.D. Ga.) in <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.312352/gov.uscourts.gand.312352.77.0.pdf\"><em>Boston v. Williams</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Plaintiffs, acting through their attorney Loletha Denise Hale (\"Attorney Hale\"), have filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's granting of summary judgment to the Defendant on the Plaintiffs' Complaint against him. The basis for the Court's granting summary judgment was that the Plaintiffs, through the inaction of their attorney, did not display the due diligence required under Georgia law to serve the Defendant with the Complaint within the applicable statute of limitations&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply appealing that ruling, which the Plaintiffs have every right to do, Plaintiffs now asks the Court to reconsider it on the basis of their previous argument that the Court is biased against them due to the Court's alleged bias against their lawyer, Attorney Hale. Their claim in that regard is centered on comments that the Court made at the oral argument on the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. Thus, a little review of the case history is in order.</p>\n<p>The Plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. And, in preparing for oral argument on the Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court read that brief, wherein Attorney Hale wrote (and cited case authority for the proposition) that the issue as to whether the Plaintiffs exercised due diligence in their efforts to serve the Defendant with process was a question of fact for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p>This argument was interesting and very strange. In the Presiding Judge's 35 years [by \"Presiding Judge,\" the judge presumably means himself -EV] as a member of the State Bar of Georgia, 23 which have been as a judge at the State and Federal level, it had always been his understanding that the issue of diligence in service efforts was one for the Court, not for a jury. But, as the Plaintiffs cited case precedent for this proposition, the Presiding Judge read the cited authority to see if the Plaintiffs might be right (and whether the Presiding Judge might be wrong).</p>\n<p>Upon reading the case, it was clear that it was the Plaintiffs (or rather, Attorney Hale) who were wrong. As the Defendant pointed out in his Reply Brief, an overwhelming number of the cases cited throughout the Plaintiffs' Brief in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment either were completely fabricated/hallucinated or did not stand for the proposition for which they were cited. In other words, they were fake.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360424\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>At the ensuing oral argument, Attorney Hale's explanation for the situation was just as bad: she admitted that the original brief she filed included many misrepresentations, but she contended her only mistake was filing the wrong brief. Attorney Hale represented to the Court that the original brief was drafted by her daughter (who does not appear to be an attorney) using AI. Attorney Hale contended that her daughter was helping her, as Attorney Hale was indisposed due to health issues of a friend. Attorney Hale contended that she had prepared another, real brief without false or fraudulent cases, but that she mistakenly filed with the Court the one that her daughter drafted for her that contained the AI hallucinations.</p>\n<p>This explanation was concerning to the Court. Not only had Attorney Hale filed a brief which was rife with misstatements of the law, but also she was admitting that she had her non-attorney daughter draft it for her. The Presiding Judge certainly did express his belief that her actions may have violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Additionally, at that hearing the Presiding Judge also articulated that he was particularly surprised that Attorney Hale would submit such a grievously fraudulent pleading given a previous occasion where Attorney Hale, then as a plaintiff in a case, had provided testimony in a jury trial before the same Presiding Judge that she later admitted was misleading and/or untrue.</p>\n<p>The argument on the merits of the Motion for Summary Judgment fared no better for the Plaintiffs, as it was clear that the Court likely would grant the Defendant's motion, although the Court reserved ruling. The Court also issued a show cause notice on September 8th of a possible Rule 11 violation by Attorney Hale and scheduled a hearing thereon to occur on September 29, 2025. Coincidentally (or not), the Plaintiffs thereafter filed a Motion to Recuse the Presiding Judge. The Court denied that motion in an order dated September 23, 2025.</p>\n<p>The Rule 11 Show Cause hearing wasn't particularly illuminating in explaining how the bad brief with fraudulent case cites came about, as Attorney Hale presented no evidence, such as having her daughter testify about the drafting of the brief. She also declined to make much of an argument in her defense, claiming she would rest on the record. Her basic position and tone were that the Presiding Judge was being unfair and that this was much ado about nothing.</p>\n<p>The Court issued an order on October 28, 2025, finding that Attorney Hale had, indeed, committed a Rule 11 violation. The Court exercised its discretion not to levy a fine against Attorney Hale, but did sanction her by requiring her to notify [existing] clients of the violation and also requiring her to file a notice of the violation in any case in which she appeared as counsel in the Northern District of Georgia for the next 5 years. [The Court later granted summary judgment.] &hellip;</p>\n<p>The Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Granting Summary Judgment is largely a repackaging of the arguments which the Plaintiffs previously have made that the Presiding Judge should have recused himself and why the Defendant wasn't entitled to summary judgment on the service issue. What is new, however, it that the Plaintiffs point to a recent complaint lodged against Attorney Hale by the State Bar of Georgia regarding her filing of the AI infected brief with the Court. The Plaintiffs claim that the Presiding Judge filed a bar complaint against Attorney Hale, which allegedly further supports their position that the Presiding Judge should not have decided the merits of the Motion for Summary Judgment&hellip;.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, perhaps it would have been more advisable for the Court not to have sent the Rule 11 Order to the State Bar until after the forthcoming appeal in this case is decided. But, at the time that the Court sent the order to the State Bar, it had already issued summary judgment to the Defendant, there were no pending matters in this case, and the case had been terminated in the Court's records.</p>\n<p>In the Court's view, the actions of Attorney Hale of filing a brief loaded with hallucinated cases and incorrect statements of the law (in addition to having a non-attorney draft the brief) in an effort to convince the Court to rule in favor of the Plaintiffs on the Motion for Summary Judgment warranted investigation by the State Bar. Honesty of attorneys appearing before the Federal and State courts of Georgia is not a trivial matter.</p>\n<p>The Court was also mindful of Rule 8.3(a) of the Code of Professional Conduct applicable to lawyers in this state, which states that \"[a] lawyer having knowledge that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, should inform the appropriate professional authority.\" Given that appeals can take anywhere from 6 months to a year or longer to get a ruling, giving notice to the State Bar of this issue when the Presiding Judge did seem appropriate.</p>\n<p>This Court denies the Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration and Motion to Vacate Judgment. It contains the \"same old - same old\" allegations, supplemented only by the additional fact that the Court forwarded its Order on the Rule 11 violations to the State Bar, an act that the Presiding Judge believed he was obligated by ethical considerations to do.</p>\n<p>In closing, it's not lost on the Court that the filing of this current motion drips with irony, as the Plaintiffs are arguing that the Presiding Judge cannot be fair (or that at least the situation presents an appearance of a conflict of interest). Yet, the Plaintiffs seek another ruling from the Presiding Judge, which is seemingly acceptable\u2014as long as it's in their favor. They can't have it both ways.</p>\n<p>In any event, the best course going forward is for this matter to end in the District Court and for the Plaintiffs to take their grievances to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. If the Circuit Court agrees with the Plaintiffs and disagrees with this Court's judgment, either in how it handled this matter procedurally or in how it resolved the Motion for Summary Judgment, that is ok. This Court has no interest in this case, other than it should be decided fairly pursuant to the substantive law and consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/10/judges-having-referred-lawyer-to-state-bar-for-alleged-ai-hallucinations-doesnt-require-judge-to-recuse/\">Judge&#039;s Having Referred Lawyer to State Bar for Alleged AI Hallucinations Doesn&#039;t Require Judge to Recuse</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Peter E. Harrell &amp; Jennifer Hillman (Lawfare) had an interesting post yesterday, \"<a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/unexpected-questions-in-learning-resources-v.-trump\">Unexpected Questions in Learning Resources v. Trump</a>,\" with the subtitle \"Are IEEPA tariffs permitted as either a lesser form of an embargo or the equivalent of a license fee? In short: no.\" An excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first unexpected issue that merited extensive discussion [at the oral argument in the tariff case] is one of the most intuitively appealing arguments in favor of the government's case: IEEPA clearly authorizes a president to embargo or block all trade, and presidents have used IEEPA with little challenge to impose trade embargoes against countries such as <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-560?toc=1\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">Iran</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-510?toc=1\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">North Korea</a>. If IEEPA authorizes embargoes, shouldn't the statute include the seemingly lesser power to tariff? Several justices were interested in whether, if IEEPA allowed embargoes but not tariffs, there would be\u2014as Justice Brett Kavanaugh put it\u2014an \"odd donut hole in the statute.\" &hellip;</p>\n<p>This argument has a certain intuitive appeal. However, it is wrong as a matter of both text and history. As Gutman said when he was pressed on the issue, the lack of a tariff power in IEEPA is \"not a donut hole\" but, rather, reflects that tariffs are \"a different kind of pastry.\"</p>\n<p>First, as a matter of history, Congress has often delegated an embargo power to the president without delegating a subsidiary tariff power. In 1794, for example, Congress delegated to President Washington\u00a0<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4939935\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">a broad power to impose or remove an embargo</a>\u00a0on U.S. trade during the five months that Congress planned to be out of session. This law empowered the president to block or allow effectively all U.S. trade, but it did not empower him to change statutory tariff rates. When Congress initially passed IEEPA's predecessor statute, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/40/STATUTE-40-Pg411.pdf\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">Trading with the Enemy Act</a>\u00a0(TWEA), in late 1917\u2014several months after America's entry into World War I\u2014it both included an expansive prohibition on trade and financial transactions with enemy nationals and authorized the president to suspend certain prohibitions and/or issue licenses authorizing American companies to engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited. But TWEA did not authorize President Wilson to set new tariff rates on trade with Germany or any of its allies.</p>\n<p>In recent decades, Congress has enacted additional sanctions and other embargoes on countries such as\u00a0<a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/5706/download?inline\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">Cuba</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/5691/download?inline\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">Iran</a>\u00a0but did not empower the president to raise tariffs on those countries. In 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Biden used IEEPA to impose myriad sanctions on Russia, including to embargo imports of various products, such as Russian oil. But it was Congress that in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7108\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">April 2022 voted to repeal Russia's most-favored-nation</a>\u00a0trading status and to authorize the president to raise tariff rates on Russia. This suggests that neither Congress nor the president viewed IEEPA as providing the authority to raise tariffs without congressional action.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360411\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Second, as a matter of textual analysis, there is little support for the government's argument that IEEPA includes a power to tariff as a derivative of an embargo power. In\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1287/375365/20250919182906186_24-1287ts_Govt_IEEPATariffs_final.pdf\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">its briefings to the Court</a>, the government cited several dictionary definitions of \"regulate,\" but none of those definitions included words such as \"tariff,\" \"tax,\" or \"duty.\" As the justices drew out at oral argument, the government can identify no other statute in which the power to regulate something\u2014such as the power to regulate pollution or to regulate securities trades\u2014has included the power to tax it, unless the statute explicitly authorized a tax or a fee. And as Justice Barrett noted at oral argument, in IEEPA the power to regulate occurs alongside a set of other powers\u2014such as to \"direct\" and to \"prohibit\"\u2014that have discrete meanings, suggesting that \"regulate,\" too, should be read to have a discrete meaning rather than being an open-ended authority for the president to do whatever he sees fit upon invoking IEEPA. This is also consistent with Congress's desire to give the president direct control over stopping trade if a national emergency necessitates such action, whereas the imposition of tariffs cedes that control to U.S. importers, who can decide whether to continue importing and pay the tariffs or not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There's much more there on that, and on what \"licenses\" means in IEEPA; read the <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/unexpected-questions-in-learning-resources-v.-trump\">whole thing</a> if you're interested. My Hoover colleague Philip Zelikow, who cosigned an amicus brief in the case, adds a complementary perspective:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Embargoes are about blocking trade, not taxing it. Licenses are about whether to grant permissions to trade, not whether or how to tax it. Fees are only incidental to the grant of permission.</p>\n<p>These are measures that originate in actions the U.S. takes against its enemies (or the analog in designated firms and persons). The legal authority to block trade historically overlapped with wartime measures and war powers.</p>\n<p>Laws governing commerce with countries with whom we have normal trade relations are in a fundamentally different category. The President could treat a country as an enemy and block trade with it. But he cannot tax normal commerce on his own authority, or the emergency authorities granted in IEEPA&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Harrell &amp; Hillman's last argument, the one about whether the tariffs can be defended as \"regulatory\" rather than \"revenue-raising,\" is also well stated. [I] also don't think there is such a creature as a \"regulatory\" tariff, a tax that becomes lawful, without congressional authorization, if paired with that adjective. But if someone did believe in that, Harrell &amp; Hillman explain why it can't be distinguished from the taxes that raise revenue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/10/tariffs-embargoes-and-license-fees/\">Tariffs, Embargoes, and License Fees</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

Instead of Chinese firms spending their capital on products from Nvidia, AMD, or allied companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, they'd likely invest in China's chip manufacturers. As previously </span><a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/09/the-gain-ai-act-looks-more-like-protectionism-than-national-security/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">covered by</span></a> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reason</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, export-driven growth has been a cornerstone of the U.S. semiconductor industry's success, even as American manufacturing capacity has fallen.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal government taking a 25 percent cut of Nvidia's sales reeks of crony capitalism and extends the use of failed tactics, like export controls, to promote sector growth. It could also be unconstitutional. Conditioning foreign sales of advanced chips on a 25 percent profit-sharing agreement would seem to </span><a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C5-1/ALDE_00013596/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contradict the Export Clause</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which plainly states that \"No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the Trump administration has made a habit of determining when and with whom private firms can conduct business. While the president claims this policy will \"support American Jobs, strengthen U.S. Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers,\" it's more likely that this method of picking winners and losers will create a cascading effect of negative consequences beyond this administration.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/trump-will-let-nvidia-sell-chips-to-china-but-the-feds-will-get-25-percent-of-the-profits/\">Trump Will Let Nvidia Sell Chips to China\u2014but the Feds Will Get 25 Percent of the Profits</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

An additional sign states, \"The Holy Family is safe in The Sanctuary of our Church&hellip;If You see I.C.E. Please Call LUCE At 617-370-5023.\" The priest has defied calls from both Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Archdiocese of Boston to remove the signs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rev. Stephen Josoma of St. Susanna Parish </span><a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/12/05/catholic-religon-immigration-protest\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">told</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> WBUR that the scene is meant to focus the Christmas story on the plight of immigrants, citing conversations with refugee families living in fear of deportation after coming to the U.S. from countries such as Honduras, Guatemala, and Afghanistan. \"These are folks who carry a lot of scars with them. Some of them are physical scars, but most are emotional,\" he told WBUR. \"They've seen their folks killed in front of them.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"You feed the hungry, you take care of the homeless, you clothe the naked, you take care of people and their needs,\" Josoma </span><a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/03/metro/dedham-church-nativity-ice-protest/#:~:text=The%20priest%20at%20a%20Catholic,is%20clear%20about%20%20112\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">told</span></a> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Boston Globe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. \"[ICE raids] are the complete antithesis of that on so many levels.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The scene has drawn criticism from both church and state. Terry Donilon, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Boston, said in a </span><a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/12/ice-director-demands-mass-church-remove-ice-was-here-nativity-scene.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MassLive.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0that the \"divisive political messaging\" should be removed, while pointing to </span><a href=\"https://www.usccb.org/news/2025/us-bishops-issue-special-message-immigration-plenary-assembly-baltimore\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">statements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that call for the humane treatment of immigrants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, both ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have condemned the church's speech. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons called for the removal of the Nativity scene in a </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ice-director-boston-archdiocese-demand-ice-here-nativity-removed-from-mass-church\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to Fox News, saying, \"The actions of the activist reverend, Stephen Josoma, are absolutely abhorrent and add to a dangerous narrative responsible for a more than 1,150% increase in assaults on ICE officers.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, </span><a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/12/ice-director-demands-mass-church-remove-ice-was-here-nativity-scene.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">told</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MassLive.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, \"Not only is this 'nativity' scene offensive to Christians, but it is also depicting something that\u2014despite what Rev. Josoma says\u2014NEVER happens. ICE does not separate families&hellip;.Get a grip and seek help.\"</span></p>\n<p>Despite McLaughlin's insistence, the agency has, in fact, separated immigrant families. In October, a case of a 13-year-old Massachusetts boy from Brazil made headlines after he was <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/20/13-year-old-boy-arrested-by-ice-still-waiting-for-a-bond-hearing-more-than-11-days-later/\">detained</a> by ICE rather than being released to his mother following his arrest by the Everett Police Department. The boy was subsequently transported to a Virginia detention center over 500 miles away without his family's or his attorney's knowledge. More cases have come to light, including a 6-year-old boy in Queens who was detained by ICE and separated from his Chinese father. And a recent <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-detentions-immigrant-kids-family-separations\">report</a> from\u00a0<em>ProPublica\u00a0</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">found that ICE has sent about 600 immigrant children to detention this year\u2014a number higher than the previous four years combined\u2014suggesting more families have also been separated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regardless of any disagreement that ICE or the DHS may have with Josoma over his church's Nativity scene\u2014should he choose to keep it\u2014this kind of speech is firmly </span><a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1-6/ALDE_00000040/#:~:text=Supreme%20Court%20cases%20recognizing%20protections,507%2C%20523%20(2022)%20.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">protected</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> under the First Amendment.

Any decision to remove the scene should be left up to the church.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite all the pushback, Josoma and about 10 other St. Susanna parishioners gathered on Monday to defend the display, </span><a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/12/dedham-priest-defends-ice-was-here-nativity-scene-after-political-pushback.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">according</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MassLive.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

In cities around the world, free or cheap parking leads to a familiar scene: drivers endlessly circling the block, waiting to happen upon someone leaving. Urban planners call it \"cruising for parking.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In congested areas, drivers looking for a spot account for nearly </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1884829988/reasonmagazinea-20/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of traffic. In Los Angeles' Westwood Village, for example, drivers </span><a href=\"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2011/04/30/donald-shoup/let-prices-do-planning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">circled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the equivalent of 950,000 extra miles and burned through 47,000 gallons of gasoline in a year, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> looking for a place to park.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wasted time, wasted gas, clogged streets, air pollution\u2014these are the hidden costs of underpricing the curb, as UCLA economist Donald Shoup argued in his 800-page, 2005 classic tome, </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1884829988/reasonmagazinea-20/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The High Cost of Free Parking</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In theory, the fix is simple. As Shoup argues, cities should price curb space based on supply and demand and then reinvest the revenue in infrastructure improvements. The price of a spot should be targeted so that one or two spots remain open on every city block.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, city planners often require that developers add </span><a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parking spaces when erecting new buildings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Those mandates eat up space, </span><a href=\"https://la.streetsblog.org/2014/10/17/new-ca-database-shows-how-much-parking-costs-and-how-little-its-used\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> construction costs, and make housing more expensive, without ever addressing the root problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guatemala City doesn't mandate new parking, nor does it price its streets. This tragedy of the commons, however, created an entrepreneurial opportunity.</span></p>\n<h1><b>Imposing Order</b></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking in Guatemala City is organized chaos. There are no meters, no apps, and no permits, and yet every day, cars line the curb, attendants whistle and wave, drivers hand over cash, and finding a place to put your vehicle is mostly hassle-free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking attendants known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (roughly translated as \"those who take care of cars\") impose order on the streets by assigning prices to unclaimed public parking spots.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are everywhere in Guatemala City\u2014lingering on street corners, waving rags to signal open spots, or counting cash. They blend into the urban fabric.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their job is to unofficially \"manage\" parking by staking out spaces with buckets, cones, or bottles, and then charging drivers to park in them. Most </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work long hours\u2014eight to 12 hours a day, five to six days a week\u2014and treat their turf as an asset. Some even run small-scale operations with shift rotations and a payroll.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their property rights are informal. Some inherited a stretch of curb from a relative; others are invited by nearby shop owners who want someone to deter theft. A few simply arrived one day and homesteaded a spot.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A woman I met named Mar\u00eda inherited her turf when her mother died. Another </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> named Miguel told me his parking business grew by accident. \"It's not like I set out to do this,\" he said. \"One day someone asked, 'Can I park here?' and I said, 'Sure, why not?' They asked, 'How much?' and I told them, 'Whatever you want to pay.' That's how it all began.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel's business took off. He hired a team of assistants to cover nearby blocks in shifts, and they hand over a share of their earnings.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The industry developed a structure. There are generally two main shifts: a daytime crew that serves workers and students from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m., and a nighttime crew with a clientele consisting mostly of restaurant and bar owners, which runs until around 1:30 a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prices vary depending on location and shift. It's more expensive to park in a busy nightlife district than in a quiet residential one. Parking at night might cost double. During peak hours or special events, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adjust rates on the spot, a form of the \"dynamic pricing\" advocated by Shoup.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also collaborate. They respect each other's boundaries, share information, and occasionally mediate disputes. \"We all help each other,\" said a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \"If someone's sick, another takes the street for the day.\"</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earn about $6.50 a day, which is less than the median income in Guatemala City, but it's enough to get by and stay off the streets.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I interviewed Tony, he was constantly being greeted by neighborhood shop owners, clients, and delivery drivers. Everyone seemed to know him.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Familiarity builds trust. Some </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often hold on to customers' keys, moving their cars when a garage needs to open or a delivery truck needs space.

Under a bill being prepared by French National Assembly member Jean-Philippe Tanguy, these brothels would operate as sex-worker-run cooperatives.</p> <p>Marine Le Pen, the former National Rally president and current National Assembly member who has run for president three times, also supports the brothel initiative, Tanguy said.</p>  <p>Tanguy told<em> Le Monde</em> that he got interested in the issue after working with a group that helps sex workers and meeting women who were leading very tough lives and women who were very proud of their work. He said he's come to believe that the current legal framework, in which paying for sex is illegal, does not actually make life better or safer for sex workers, since it drives the industry underground\u2014where violence still takes place, but people ignore it. He called the system \"the height of bourgeois hypocrisy.\"</p> <p>It was only in 2016 that France made paying for sex acts a crime. But the country officially ended its legal brothel system back in 1946. (Prostitution still remained technically legal, but many activities related to it were criminalized.)</p> <p>Interestingly, the woman who advocated for the brothel closures\u2014Marthe Richard, a former spy and sex worker whom the law was named after\u2014later seemed to regret it, saying that prostitution couldn't be eradicated and brothels were a \"lesser evil,\" <a href=\"https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/front-national/le-rassemblement-national-prepare-une-proposition-de-loi-pour-rouvrir-les-maisons-closes-sous-un-autre-nom_AN-202512080689.html\">according to</a> the French radio and TV network BFM.</p> <p>A move to decriminalize clients and allow sex workers to work together would be a step in the right direction for sex worker rights and safety. But any plan that allows this <em>exclusively</em> in brothels would still perpetuate many of the harms of criminalization.</p> <p>\"Brothels yes very well, but it must be an OPTION, not an obligation,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/PlusLibQ/status/1998319117191803248\">suggested</a> French commentator Edouard Hesse on X, urging Tanguy to listen to sex workers. \"We need to decriminalize this activity, protect rights, fight against coercion.\"</p> <p>Forging an alliance between the far-right party and sex worker rights advocates could prove difficult, no matter the particulars. Parisian sex worker Myl\u00e8ne Juste, a spokesperson for the group STRASS, told <em>Le Monde</em> there was no way they were going to ally with the National Rally, a nationalist and populist party that wants to drastically reduce French immigration.</p> <p>But National Rally politicians aren't the only ones who want to revise France's prostitution laws. Philippe Juvin, a Republican member of the National Assembly who last year introduced a bill aimed at securing sex worker rights, said this is also an issue he intends to revisit.</p> <p>Juvin complained to <em>Le Monde</em> about the current situation, in which both social stigma and the law prohibit sex workers from working safely and normally. He cited Belgium\u2014where <a href=\"https://reason.com/2022/03/23/belgium-decriminalizes-prostitution/\">sex work was decriminalized</a> in 2022 and <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/05/20/belgium-protects-sex-work-employees-right-to-refuse-customers-sex-acts/\">further moved to secure sex worker rights</a> and autonomy last year\u2014as a good model to follow.</p> <hr /> <h1>More Sex &amp; Tech News</h1> <p><strong>Families want to revisit Tim Ballard/Net Nanny convictions</strong>: Disgraced sex-trafficking \"rescue\" guru Tim Ballard, founder of the vigilante group Operation Underground Railroad, helped Washington state conduct \"Operation Net Nanny\" stings that \"landed hundreds in prison and put hundreds more on lifetime sex offender registries,\" <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/net-nanny-washington-state-police-stings/\">notes</a> <em>The Appeal.</em> When Ballard was accused of sexual misconduct and trafficking himself, \"the families of the men Operation Net Nanny sent to prison began asking why no one was willing to take a second look at their loved ones' convictions.\"</p> <p><strong>President Donald Trump wants to put a stop to state laws regulating artificial intelligence.</strong> \"A draft executive order that circulated last month directed the U.S. attorney general to sue states to overturn A.I. laws,\" <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/us/politics/trump-executive-order-ai-laws.html\">reports</a> <em>The New York Times</em>. \"Federal regulators were also directed to withhold broadband grants and other funding to states with A.I. laws.\" On Monday, the president posted to Truth Social:</p> <p><iframe class=\"truthsocial-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" src=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115684148454828379/embed\" width=\"600\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><script src=\"https://truthsocial.com/embed.js\" async=\"async\"></script></p> <p>But it's hard to see how an executive order banning states from passing AI laws would be constitutional.

    "full_content": "Their team lost.\n\nEight teen football players from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were arrested on theft charges in Florida after being caught in a brazen \"conspiracy\" to steal thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise from a Dick's Sporting Goods. The juvenile suspects had traveled to Polk County, Florida, to participate in the Prolifix Nationals tournament at the time of their apprehensions.\n\n\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) said in a press release that the incident occurred just hours before the teens were scheduled to participate in the championship game. They were handcuffed instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 10:55 am on December 6, a store manager at the Dick's Sporting Goods in Davenport contacted the sheriff's office \"after observing multiple juveniles concealing merchandise.\" PCSO deputies arrived on scene and detained all eight football players.According to authorities, the suspects split into two groups to carry out the conspiracy. Marcus Hudgens, 15, made a purchase near the front of the store and then approached his teammates, who were walking around inside. Hudgens opened his Dick's Sporting Goods bag, and the other suspects placed merchandise inside it.Daimon Johnson, 15, Mark Bryan, 15, and Ibn Mahdee Abdul Haqq, 14, then exited the store with the bag full of stolen merchandise. They were arrested upon exit. Abdul-Haqq allegedly had stolen merchandise concealed inside a black backpack, while Bryan was in possession of the bag from the store that consisted of more than $2,000 worth of stolen goods. The other five suspects were detained inside the store. This included Hudgens, Elijah Myers, 14, Tymir Speller, 15, Tymir Smith, 14, and Jacob Scott, 15. Authorities discovered a beanie hidden inside Speller's pants when he was detained, according to the press release.Photo Polk County Sheriff's OfficeThe eight teens were identified as members of the United Thoroughbreds, a youth football team located in Philadelphia. The total value of stolen merchandise totaled $2,296.07.\"These juveniles were not from Polk County, they came here from Philly for a football tournament, and instead of representing their team with pride, they chose to steal - they are Thoroughbred thieves,\" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who shamed the players in a press conference. \"Let this be clear: it doesn't matter if you're from here or visiting, if you break the law in Polk County, you will be arrested and held accountable.\"The team's coach, Raekwon Bynes, 29, responded to the store and confirmed to authorities that the teens were staying in Davenport for the championship game, the sheriff's office said. The eight suspects had no prior criminal histories and declined to provide statements to authorities. The players were transported to the Juvenile Assessment Center, and each was charged with retail theft and conspiracy to commit retail theft.Sheriff Judd congratulated the opposing team for defeating the Thoroughbreds in the championship game, stating that the Coco Tigers didn't just win but \"ran over them.\" The Thoroughbreds lost the game 26-6.",
