The Indonesian buyer lines up a Chinese AI startup as the end user: Indosat agreed to purchase the servers only after securing a major client facilitated by Aivres: Shanghai-based AI startup INF Tech. Negotiations also included representatives from Fudan University, where INF\u2019s founder, Qi Yuan, directs an AI institute. The Chinese startup intends to use the chips for finance and medical AI: By October, the servers had arrived in Indonesia and were being set up. INF plans to use the computing power to train AI models for financial analytics and scientific research, including drug-discovery applications.\n\nAccording to attorneys familiar with export-control rules, as long as the Chinese company isn't directly using the chips to help China with military intelligence or weapons of mass destruction, the arrangement doesn't violate any laws set by the Trump administration.\n\nNvidia has responded to The Information, telling the outlet in a written statement: \"We haven\u2019t seen any substantiation or received tips of \u2018phantom data centers\u2019 constructed to deceive us and our [server manufacturing] partners, then deconstructed, smuggled and reconstructed somewhere else. While such smuggling seems farfetched, we pursue any tip we receive.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the company has developed a software feature to track the location of its chips - which could help the company combat chip smuggling, Reuters reported Wednesday. If this feature becomes live, it could 'severely cripple' the use of smuggled chips in China.",

These materials are vital for defense technologies, electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, aerospace components, and advanced electronics, positioning Round Top as the foundation of USAR\u2019s fully integrated \u201cmine-to-magnet\u201d supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>That supply chain also includes:</p>\n\n<ul><li>\n\t<p>a 310,000 sq. ft. magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma, expected to become the largest metal-and-alloy-making and strip-casting facility outside China, and</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>a processing and separation laboratory in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, supporting domestic mineral refinement and separation.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><p>CEO Barbara Humpton said the accelerated production schedule reflects the company\u2019s growing technical edge and its commitment to strengthen U.S. supply chains amid rising global demand for permanent magnets and heightened geopolitical risk. She called the new timeline an \u201cexciting milestone\u201d made possible by the team\u2019s process engineering, scientific capabilities, and operational ingenuity.</p>\n\n<p>The revised schedule stems from strong solvent-extraction piloting. USAR plans to launch its Hydromet demonstration facility in Colorado in early 2026, where five extraction circuits will run continuously for 2,000\u20134,000 hours to generate final commercial design data. These circuits will isolate high-value heavy rare earths\u2014especially dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb), essential for high-strength magnets\u2014while also producing other strategic minerals such as hafnium and zirconium.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.16.41.jpg?itok=sdMmSYOX\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.16.41.jpg?itok=sdMmSYOX\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"63bd668a-79fe-4fc1-93ec-2d4d0f9776d0\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"306\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.16.41.jpg?itok=sdMmSYOX\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>This parallel-processing approach is projected to save tens of millions of dollars and enable completion of a definitive feasibility study by early 2027. With those milestones accelerated, USAR anticipates entering commercial production in 2028, creating earlier cash flow opportunities while bolstering a secure domestic supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>The news also intersects with rising political emphasis on reshoring strategic minerals. During the Trump administration, rare earth supply security became a national priority amid escalating trade tensions with China, which dominates global processing. Trump issued executive actions directing agencies to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign minerals, opened pathways for funding domestic mining projects, and prioritized rare earths in defense procurement. Continued focus on critical mineral independence in a second Trump term will likely further support companies like USAR as they work to build a fully <em><strong>domestic</strong></em> mine-to-magnet ecosystem.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T14:30:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 09:30</span>\n",

It is not realistic to expect the FOMC to box itself in too much by signaling a very strong bias toward a pause in January because if the labor market is still actively softening at that point, a cut might be appropriate.

A full preview is available in the Newsquawk Research Suite. Overnight attention has centred on trade developments, with CNBC noting that China has resumed purchases of US soybeans, though it remains behind the targets outlined in the Trump trade deal.

Further for the EUR, on Tuesday, the French National Assembly approved the social security budget in a narrow vote, passing by just 13 votes \u2014 a close outcome in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. Notably, all of President Macron\u2019s Renaissance lawmakers backed the bill, while Les R\u00e9publicains showed a more divided stance.

From a yield perspective, rates are higher across the curve, with the belly leading. Focus overnight has been on trade developments, with CNBC reporting that China is buying US soybeans again, but is reportedly falling short of the goal set by the Trump trade agreement. Turning to the Fed, the FT reported that President Trump will begin the final round of Fed Chair interviews \u2013 but senior officials still expect the White House NEC Director Hassett as the frontrunner.

Bunds Mar\u201926 is currently trading towards the lower end of a 127.05 to 127.49 range, with the trough marking a contract low. Earlier, there was some commentary via ECB\u2019s Villeroy and Simkus, where the former focused on the French economy, whilst the latter suggested that the policy rate does not need to be lowered further \u2013 a move also concurred by market pricing, which sees rates steady through 2026.

So the S&P 500 (-0.09%) posted a modest decline, and futures for the index (-0.01%) remain flat this morning. However, the bond selloff continued in several places, with 10yr Treasury yields (+2.4bps) drifting up to a three-month high as investors kept dialling back their expectations for rate cuts next year. In fact in Australia overnight, their 10yr yield (+3.7bps) has just hit its highest level since late-2023, so that momentum has shown few signs of letting up. To be fair it wasn\u2019t all bad news, with the Franco-German 10yr spread closing at its tightest since August, shortly before lawmakers went on to back the social security budget. But as investors have pivoted to expect rate hikes next year for many countries, sovereign bonds have struggled across the board.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to the Fed\u2019s decision tonight, it\u2019s widely expected that they\u2019ll deliver another 25bp rate cut, which would be the third consecutive rate cut since the September meeting. At their last meeting in late-October, Chair Powell had said that a December cut was \u201cnot a foregone conclusion \u2013 far from it.\u201d But since then, the subsequent jobs report for September showed a further uptick in the unemployment rate, to 4.4%, which strengthened the dovish arguments and led markets to price back in another cut for today. So futures are pricing in a 90% chance of a cut as we go to press.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\nBeyond the immediate policy decision, our US economists also expect there to be dissents in both a hawkish and dovish direction. So to forge a consensus behind a rate cut today, they anticipate the statement and press conference will signal that the hurdle is relatively high for another cut in early 2026. Remember as well that we\u2019ll also get the latest Summary of Economic Projections, containing the dot plot for where officials expect rates to move in the years ahead. Our economists think the median dots will stay unchanged, consistent with one further 25bp cut in each of 2026 and 2027. See their full preview here for more details.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Beyond today however, there\u2019s been mounting speculation more broadly that central banks are increasingly finished with their rate cutting cycles. Indeed, those moves got further support after the latest batch of US data, which showed that job openings rose to a 5-month high of 7.670m in October (vs. 7.117m expected). So that pushed back against fears of a deteriorating labour market and helped push front-end Treasury yields higher. Admittedly, there were some less positive details, and the quits rate of those voluntarily leaving their job fell to a 5-year low of 1.8%. But overall, investors were reassured by the rise in openings, with the amount of Fed cuts priced by December 2026 down by -5.7bps to 72bps. And in turn, the 2yr Treasury yield (+3.8bps) moved up to 3.61%, whilst the 10yr yield (+2.4bps) rose to 4.19%.</p>\n\n<p>Staying on the Fed, the FT reported yesterday that Trump would soon conduct a final round of interviews with the candidates for Fed Chair. The article said that officials thought NEC Director Kevin Hassett was still \u201cin pole position\u201d, and Trump separately said to reporters on Air Force One that \u201cI have a pretty good idea of who I want\u201d. Interestingly though, the article floated that there had been discussion about Hassett serving a shorter term, potentially by moving into Powell\u2019s seat on the Board of Governors, which expires in January 2028. So that would leave the option of nominating a different Fed Chair later in Trump\u2019s term. We did hear from Hassett as well yesterday, who said there was \u201cplenty of room\u201d for more cuts, although markets didn\u2019t have too much reaction given that was in line with his previous comments for more easing. However, the FT report saw Hassett\u2019s odds of becoming chair move a bit lower on Polymarket, and they currently stand at 71% as we go to press this morning.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, equities didn\u2019t see too much of a reaction to all this, with the S&P 500 (-0.09%) posting a marginal decline, whilst the NASDAQ (+0.13%) and small-cap Russell 2000 (+0.21%) both moved higher. In terms of the outperformers, the Magnificent 7 (+0.26%) did see a stronger gain, but traditional blue chip stocks underperformed amid higher rates, leaving the Dow Jones down -0.38%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan (-4.66%) was the third-worst performer in the S&P 500 after warning of higher-than-expected costs.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Over in Europe, the spotlight was on France yesterday, where lawmakers backed the social security budget with a narrow 247-234 margin in the final vote. However, achieving this majority came at the cost of a higher underlying deficit for 2026 because of the pension reform suspension and increased health spending. Nevertheless, the signs of progress were met positively by markets, and the Franco-German 10yr spread reached its tightest since late-August yesterday, at 71bps. However, the political fragmentation is still clear, and attention will now turn to the State budget, which is due to be approved no later than December 23 and where agreement remains distant.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in Europe, sovereign bonds rallied across the board, with yields on 10yr bunds (-1.2bps), OATs (-2.8bps) and BTPs (-1.8bps) all falling back. However, for equities it was more mixed, with the STOXX 600 (-0.10%) narrowly losing ground. That came amidst an outperformance in Germany, with the DAX up +0.49% after Bloomberg reported that lawmakers were set to approve \u20ac52bn in defence orders next week. The news saw defence stocks outperform, with the STOXX Aerospace & Defense Index up +0.79%, whilst Rheinmetall was up +3.56%.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Overnight in Asia, we\u2019ve seen losses across the major equity indices before the Fed\u2019s decision. Chinese equities have struggled, with the CSI 300 (-0.88%) and the Shanghai Comp (-0.76%) posting declines, but we\u2019ve also seen losses for the KOSPI (-0.27%) and the Nikkei (-0.44%) as well. Staying on China, the latest data overnight has shown that CPI inflation moved up to +0.7% in November, an increase from +0.2% in October. The move was in line with consensus, but also marks the fastest pace since February 2024. However, PPI inflation remained in deflationary territory for a 38th consecutive month, coming in at -2.2% (vs. -2.0% expected).\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To the day ahead, the biggest event will be the FOMC\u2019s decision and Chair Powell\u2019s press conference. Other central bank events will be the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision, and we\u2019ll also hear from ECB President Lagarde.\u00a0 In terms of economic releases, we\u2019ll see the US Q3 employment cost index, and Italy\u2019s industrial production for October.

We can have multiple overlapping stories--Jungian psychology, general theory of relativity, Keynesian economics, and so on--but we need a story that explains key elements of our experience and what we observe and \"know,\" with\u00a0<em>know</em>\u00a0in quotes to indicate that\u00a0<strong>the story we embrace defines what we\u00a0<em>know</em>\u00a0and what we can\u00a0<em>know</em>.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Given this need for a story, we can only relinquish a story that's failing to account for what we observe if we have a\u00a0<em>better story</em>\u00a0available:</strong>\u00a0and by \"better\" I mean one that more accurately accounts for what we observe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This substitution of a new story for an existing story that no longer\u00a0<em>makes sense</em>\u00a0(i.e. offers constructive predictions) of the world is easily confused with another human trait:</strong>\u00a0the power of\u00a0<em>the Powers That Be</em>\u00a0rest on a foundational story, and replacing this story removes the source of their power. Replacing the story that empowers them discredits their claim to superiority, effectively stripping away their entitlement to authority and their overweening delusions of grandiosity that come with entering the ranks of\u00a0<em>the Powers That Be</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This desire to maintain the status quo story as part of maintaining their authority and power is the core dynamic described by Thomas Kuhn in his classic\u00a0<a href=\"https://amzn.to/4a1Ntqw\">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a></strong>: the Old Guard who embraced the story that the universe revolves around the Earth resists accepting the new story that the Earth is an inconsequential minor planet that orbits the sun in a local system which is in motion in much larger structures even as all the observational data undermines their story and supports the new story.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fast-forward to the present and we have multiple Old Guards clinging to ideological stories that no longer track what we observe.</strong>\u00a0Yet like all previous Old Guards,\u00a0<em>the Powers That Be</em>\u00a0are loathe to accept a new story that strips away their claim to authority and all the perquisites of power they currently enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We live in a world torn between the artifices needed to make \"the Earth is the center of the Universe\" somewhat plausible even as that story crumbles into incoherence and the formation of a new story that actually tracks reality.</strong>\u00a0In terms of a metaphor, consider a glossy \"lifestyle\" publication that simultaneously touts a new chocolate cake recipe that is simply out of this world and a new diet to slim down in a healthier way than taking meds with horrible side effects that must be taken for life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No wonder the world seems deranged--it is deranged by the immense strength of an Old Guard clinging onto power\u00a0<em>by any means available</em>\u00a0even as the world around them spins into incoherence.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Economic incoherence:</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/cartoon-profit_0.jpg?itok=UNPArq9I\" data-link-option=\"0\"

In some cities, buyers must now have more than $200,000 to afford the median-priced home.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cNationally, over 75 percent of U.S. homes on the market are unaffordable to the typical household,\u201d</strong></em> Bankrate said.</p>\n\n<p>Typical households must make at least $33,000 more to afford median-priced homes.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the 34 largest American metros analyzed by Bankrate, only about a dozen have more than 30 percent of properties that a typical household can afford, the company said. This affects even markets long considered to be affordable, such as San Antonio, Charlotte, and Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>San Francisco had the highest income requirement, with prospective buyers having to make $353,500 annually to purchase a typical home</strong>. This was followed by Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City, and Seattle, all of which require more than $200,000 in income.</p>\n\n<p>Detroit was the cheapest metro area, requiring only an income of $66,700 to buy a home. This was followed by Pittsburgh and Louisville, both of which required less than $80,000.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cAnyone earning the median U.S. income will find themselves priced out of three out of every four U.S. homes on the market,\u201d Bankrate said.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\u201cA big reason why: there simply aren\u2019t enough homes up for sale right now. Homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the pandemic have been staying put, and builders haven\u2019t kept up with demand since the Great Recession.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cAt the same time, home prices soared during the pandemic, followed by the steepest rise in mortgage rates in about two decades. With wages struggling to keep up, housing affordability has reached historically low levels in recent years.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p>The average sales price of homes sold in the United States jumped from $371,100 in the second quarter of 2020 to $512,800 in the same period this year, an increase of more than 38 percent over a five-year period, according to <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=CpFW\">data</a> from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.19 percent for the week ending Dec. 4, according to <a href=\"https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms\">data</a> from Freddie Mac. This is more than double the 2.71 percent rate roughly five years ago.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amid high housing costs, inventory growth is slowing down,</strong> real estate brokerage Redfin said in a Dec. 4 <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/press-releases/redfin-reports-inventory-growth-loses-steam-as-would-be-sellers-react-to-lackluster-homebuying-demand/\">statement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Total housing supply is losing steam, and new home listings are stalling, the brokerage said.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe pool of buyers is small partly because we\u2019re entering the slow season for real estate, but it\u2019s also because houses are expensive, rates are elevated, and people are feeling cautious about their pocketbooks,\u201d said Carlos Castillo, a Redfin Premier agent in Los Angeles.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cHouse hunters may be able to find a deal because there are more sellers than buyers, but I\u2019m advising buyers to be strategic.

The description of the system being a \"new\" defense capability is interesting, however.</p>\n\n<p>\"The tragedy occurred during training, and we extend our condolences to the family and loved ones,\" the statement added, emphasizing that it was not combat related.</p>\n\n<p>The British soldier may have been observing active combat from a distance, as <em>Financial Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dddb71e-a472-4bb0-a844-07c87e8ea6ff\">suggests</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>An MoD spokesperson said the death <strong>was not believed to have been caused by hostile fire</strong>, and the soldier had been injured \u201cwhilst observing Ukrainian forces test a new defensive capability, away from the front lines\u201d. The serviceman, whose name has not been released, died on Tuesday morning. His family has been informed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While there have over the years of the Ukraine war been reports of British security contractors and volunteers dying while fighting Russia, <strong>this marks a rare - and possibly first - known death of an <em>active </em>UK service member in the country</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As <em>The Guardian</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/member-uk-armed-forces-killed-accident-ukraine-mod\">observes</a>, \"A Ukrainian memorial produced by the Kyiv war museum has <strong>counted that 40 Britons have died defending Ukraine</strong>, a higher number than previously thought. <strong>None are known to have been serving in the British military at the time of their death</strong>.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to more from FT:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In July, UK Defence Secretary John Healey told parliament that UK personnel were in Ukraine to scout new security arrangements to support Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. He said planning included <strong>\"reconnaissance in Ukraine, led by UK personnel\"</strong>.\u00a0 </em></p>\n\n<p><em>The circumstances of the accident remain unclear, including what was being tested and how the soldier came to be fatally injured. Ukrainian forces have been trialling a range of new defensive technologies \u2014 from counter-drone systems to new long-range missiles \u2014 as they continue to adapt to evolving battlefield threats.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Britain all the way back closer to the start of the war in 2022 became among the first Western countries to begin hosting Ukrainian troop training programs on its soil.

This is a censorship-by-proxy strategy. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from 2020 to 2022, and Europe today, have authorized government-funded NGOs to demand censorship of social media platforms in an attempt to deceive the public.</p>\n\n<p>As such, <strong>the European Commission is spreading disinformation in order to demand censorship, and is openly engaged in a deception campaign aimed at confusing the people of Europe and the United States about what it is doing.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many Americans may rightly wonder why they should care about what the European government is doing. President Donald Trump shut down much of the US censorship industrial complex, including by the DHS.</p>\n\n<p>The reason we should care is that <strong>the goal of the European Commission, like that of the governments of Britain, Brazil, and Australia, is to censor the American people. </strong>As Public was the first to report in October, a pro-censorship activist think tank, the Stanford Cyberpolicy Center, hosted a gathering of global censorship officials to censor American social media platforms and American citizens. The Stanford Cyberpolicy Center was home to the fake \u201cresearchers\u201d who oversaw the DHS censorship-by-proxy effort from 2020 to 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Moreover, the EU is now in direct violation of the NATO Treaty, under which the US is militarily obligated to defend Europe.</strong> The NATO Treaty requires member states to have free speech and free and fair elections. France and Germany are actively and illegally preventing political candidates from running for office for ideological reasons, namely their opposition to mass migration. And the Romanian high court, with the support of the European Commission, nullified election results under the thin and unproven pretext of Russian interference, after a nationalist and populist presidential candidate won.</p>\n\n<p>The X fine comes in the wake of a renewed push for governments to break encryption and read private text messages, known as \u201cChat Control.\u201d The ostensible goal of this is to combat child abuse, and yet there is little evidence that such a system is needed. The heads of Signal and Telegram have strongly opposed the effort as a violation of privacy and a backdoor that others could exploit.</p>\n\n<p>And l<strong>ast month, the European Commission launched a \u201cDemocracy Shield\u201d program consisting of more funding for NGOs and \u201cfact checkers\u201d to \u201censure swift reactions to large-scale and potentially transnational information operations.</strong> An independent European Network of Fact-Checkers will be set up to boost fact-checking capacity in all EU official languages\u2026\u201d In the past, activist NGOs have demanded that social media companies censor content based on fact-checks, including false ones.</p>\n\n<p>The European Digital Services Act (DSA) rests upon a model of censorship by proxy. The proxies are NGOs, law enforcement organizations, and industry groups designated \u201cTrusted Flaggers.\u201d Noted Lorc\u00e1n Price of the Alliance Defending Freedom in his testimony to Congress in September of year, \u201cWhen a Trusted Flagger speaks, the service provider must listen and prioritize the review of the flagged content before that of its regular users. The service provider must review the flagged content to determine whether it violates the law of an EU member state or the EU itself. If so, the service provider must remove or disable access to the content.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Notably, the European Commission announced its X fine on the same day that the Trump administration released its new security strategy, which reads, \u201cWe will oppose elite-driven, anti-democratic restrictions on core liberties in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world, especially among our allies.\u201d The document implicitly threatens US commitment to military security for Europe. \u201cIt is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The European Constitution states that \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Why then is it now seeking to deny those rights?</p>\n\n<p><em>Please <a href=\"https://x.com/shellenberger/status/1997081936758820877\">subscribe now</a> to support Public's defense of free speech, read the full article, and watch the full video!</em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T10:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 05:00</span>\n",

He walked closer to Manfred until their noses almost touched, and told the commissioner that if Manfred wanted to talk salary cap, he could \u201cget the fuck out of our clubhouse.\u201d\n\nA couple months later, at the Minnesota Lynx\u2019s end-of-season press conference, Napheesa Collier had some words for her league\u2019s commissioner, too. The WNBA is in the thick of labor talks these days: The league and players\u2019 union recently agreed to extend their collective bargaining negotiating period through January. Collier\u2019s sport is undergoing its own economic transformation. Amid a women\u2019s basketball boom, WNBA team prices have skyrocketed, and the league\u2019s new media rights deal is valued at a figure six times the old one. Today\u2019s labor fight pits players who feel they\u2019ve driven this growth against the owners who feel they\u2019re owed for years of losses. In Collier\u2019s telling, commissioner Cathy Engelbert is a poor steward for the moment, a leader who takes the WNBA\u2019s talent for granted. \u201cThe league believes it succeeds despite its players, not because of them,\u201d Collier said, adding later that \u201cthe best players in the world\u201d had \u201cthe worst leadership in the world.\u201d The measure she took was public and not so lurid a confrontation as Harper\u2019s\u2014no baseball bats involved. But the basic idea was the same: to establish whose clubhouse it really is.\n\nFor an emblem of player-commissioner relations in the NFL today, the New York Times reporter Ken Belson writes, look to the \u201cRoger Goodell Bro Hug.\u201d Every spring, the newest first-round picks bound across the NFL draft stage and wrap their arms around the commissioner. Sometimes they lift him off his feet. A hug Goodell shared with Baltimore Ravens draftee Malaki Starks this past April lasted 21 seconds. Speaking to Belson, an agent laments the annual show of affection for management, though he can\u2019t help but admire the bleak triumph it signals: \u201cYou have to give kudos to the NFL for making it that way.\u201d\n\nBelson\u2019s new book, Every Day Is Sunday: How Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, and Roger Goodell Turned the NFL into a Cultural & Economic Juggernaut, is a sobering account of how the NFL made the world this way, its way, totally in its image. Today, the football fan wakes to kickoffs in London and Berlin; she dozes off to the drawl of Cris Collinsworth, whose network pays $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Night Football. In 2024, NFL games accounted for 72 of the 100 highest-rated broadcasts on American TV. The year before, without the election and Olympics to account for, that number was 93.\n\nNFL revenues have more than tripled since Belson began covering the league's inner workings in 2013. Since then, the NFL has glided through obstacles: damning concussion research, increased attention on players arrested for domestic violence, high-profile player protests, tawdry owner scandals, the rise of streaming services, and overtures from private equity. In the book\u2019s acknowledgements, Belson recalls his Times editor\u2019s early mandate to cover the NFL \u201cas a really, really big business.\u201d Off the field were the real stories. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not at whatever folks consider to be the \u2018big game\u2019 of the week.\u201d\n\nThe Goodell presented in Every Day Is Sunday might be flattered by that kind of attention. At a 2010 meeting, he presented owners with a then-unthinkable financial target, to grow league revenue from $8 billion to $25 billion by 2027. In doing so, Goodell set his sights far beyond the little Sports Tuesday section on B8. \u201cRoger doesn\u2019t view the other leagues as competition,\u201d an NFL staffer tells Belson. \u201cHe wants to be mentioned with Disney and the Vatican, these massive institutions.\u201d Now in his 20th season as commissioner, Goodell has won his bosses gobs of money with what Belson paints as both political savvy and quiet ambition. The $25 billion vision will indeed come to pass in a couple of years, but the prophet won\u2019t be satisfied. When a friend emailed him the stat about 93 of 100 broadcasts, Goodell replied, \u201cWe have a couple of more spots to fill!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a story to read in the book\u2019s negative space: If Goodell, Kraft, and Jones have built the NFL as we know it now, it\u2019s been built almost entirely on ownership\u2019s terms. When they are drawn at all, the lines between labor and management are quickly smudged by a slick league PR apparatus. Rarely these days are the lines drawn by the sport\u2019s most prominent players. (Per the book\u2019s index, Magary, Drew is mentioned once, the same number of times as Mahomes, Patrick.)\n\nGoodell became commissioner in 2006, months after the NFL signed a CBA granting players 52 percent of league revenue after deductions. Owners quickly soured on the split. (\u201cA mean mother,\u201d Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called it.) In 2008, they exercised an opt-out clause to shorten the deal by a year. The 2011 lockout that followed marked the start of a prolonged\u2014and maybe still active\u2014period of backlash. For enduring labor\u2019s brief edge, the billionaires were owed reparations. As then-Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson put it at a 2010 owners meeting, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stick together and take back our league.\u201d That phrase, \u201cour league,\u201d confirms a suspicion voiced in the book by Jeff Saturday, a lead NFLPA player rep at the time: \u201cI feel like at times Jerry [Richardson] felt like the owners had created this thing as opposed to the other way around.\u201d The eventual 2011 deal reduced players' share of league revenue to 47 percent. Saturday and Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, christened the end of the lockout with a hug.\n\nRob Carr/Getty Images\n\nEvery Day Is Sunday brought to mind John Helyar\u2019s 1994 classic Lords of the Realm, a dishy history of labor wins in baseball. (Come back! It\u2019s interesting! I swear!) Helyar finds an easy hero in the union boss Marvin Miller, whose gift for \u201cconsciousness-raising\u201d made the MLBPA the gold standard. Miller turned \u201ccompliant peons to budding rebels\u201d with a message so simple and eternal that today a raw milk-drinking, de-blooded, re-blooded red-ass superstar slugger getting Wobbly just scans as basic gene expression. \u201cYou are the game,\u201d Miller told the players. \u201cWithout you there is no game.\u201d That spirit won MLB players free agency, better pensions, and the right to salary arbitration. Bit by bit, they clawed power away from \u201cthe Lords.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, these two books tell opposite stories, but it might be truer to call them different parts of the same story. In Belson\u2019s sequel\u2014spoiler!\u2014the Lords strike back. A chapter on the 2017 player protests is both instructive and nauseating as a peek into the NFL's corporate machinery. After players knelt during the national anthem in protest of police brutality, Goodell arranged a meeting between players and owners. One of the players was Anquan Boldin, whose goals here were not particularly lofty. Before the meeting, he told Goodell he wanted the owners to join the players in calling for legislative reform. \u201cIf an owner or the commissioner goes into a meeting with me, the conversation changes from a photo op to talking about true issues,\u201d he said.\n\nBoldin repeated this wish to owners in the meeting, a recording of which was sent to Belson:\n\nLater in the meeting, Boldin was more direct. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018players are being militant,\u2019 we\u2019re looked at as villains,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can have owners come and say, nationally, that no, they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re Americans, they care about the cities they\u2019re in, they care about these issues, we care about these issues, we\u2019re behind them, we\u2019re gonna educate ourselves about these issues, and we\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re gonna push forward. That changes us as a nation.\u201d\n\nAny genuine desires Boldin and the players voiced in that meeting would re-emerge from a Park Avenue boardroom as the Inspire Change initiative. Everyone was allowed to write \u201cEnd Racism\u201d on their cleats. Tension bubbled up again the next year, when owners pushed to officially mandate standing for the anthem. But that story ends tidily, with Kraft recruiting Jay-Z to produce the Super Bowl halftime show. It ends also with an amendment to the NFL game operations manual: \u201cAll teams and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and anthem.\u201d Earlier this year, the \u201cEnd Racism\u201d messaging was quietly scrapped.\n\nInterviewed for Ben Lindbergh\u2019s Lords of the Realm retrospective at The Ringer in 2019, Helyar noted a recent \u201ccreep toward owners\u201d in baseball. Belson\u2019s book warns that labor peace only means it\u2019s time to get back on defense. That can be hard in sports, where the labor force is trained to take things one game at a time. Owners like to leverage the brevity of most athletic careers to paint the real fight as one among labor, imagined between stars and scrubs. In an Atlanta Braves investor call this past June, Manfred copped to the clubhouse tour strategy: \u201cI usually try to avoid the high-earning guy at this point and find a younger player and say, \u2018Look, if you\u2019re one of the 10 percent, it\u2019s a great deal. But if you\u2019re the other 90, it ain\u2019t so good.\u2019\u201d Collier, an MVP candidate who co-founded the offseason league Unrivaled, has been charged with having a conflict of interest that would make her less sensitive to (or even the beneficiary of) a WNBA lockout.\n\nWhy do Kraft, Jones, and Goodell win so much? One trait they share is a stubborn belief in their own permanence. If Jones should ever die, visitors to the Dallas Cowboys' stadium may see him live on in hologram form; AI Jerry pops up at the end of the \u201cOwners Experience Tour.\u201d Kraft and Jones both star in multi-part docu-hagiographies, available to stream. Even in their eighties, neither owner speaks much of succession, and friends of Goodell\u2019s say they have never heard him mention retirement either. Every day is Sunday, and it will be forever.\n\nMiller asked players to think on exactly these terms, to remember that their cause transcends any one life or contract. \u201cThis could be my last year in baseball, and if the strike lasts the entire season and I\u2019ve played my last game, well, it will be painful,\u201d Giants player rep Willie Mays tells his fellow reps in a union meeting in Lords of the Realm, during the 1972 strike. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t hang together, everything we\u2019ve worked for will be lost.\u201d There\u2019s another means of immortality, not the hologram or the docuseries, just the simple vow to keep an eye out for someone else so they can one day do the same. When he signed a record contract with the New York Yankees in 2019, ace Gerrit Cole thanked Curt Flood and Miller, labor heroes he\u2019d first learned about from a veteran teammate in Pittsburgh. Of particular concern to Collier, she said in her press conference, were the underpaid stars coming up in the league, the ones four or five years younger. Harper has already signed the last big contract he will ever sign. We\u2019ll all die one day, but there\u2019s still some part to play, some piece of the fight to wage. You can hug it out, or you can pick up a bat.",

    "full_content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2013 Ukrainian officials were expected to hand their latest peace proposals to United States negotiators Wednesday, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who also said Ukraine would be ready for elections within three months if partners can guarantee a safe vote during wartime and if its electoral law can be altered.\n\nZelenskyy was responding to comments by U.S. President Donald Trump in which he questioned Ukraine\u00b4s democracy and suggested the Ukrainian leader was using the war as an excuse not to hold an election.\n\nZelenskyy told reporters late Tuesday that he is \u201cready\u201d for an election but would need help from the U.S. and possibly Europe to ensure security for a vote to happen. He suggested that Ukraine could be ready to hold balloting in 60 to 90 days if that proviso is met.\n\n\u201cTo hold elections, two issues must be addressed: primarily, security \u2013 how to conduct them, how to do it under strikes, under missile attacks; and a question regarding our military \u2013 how they would vote,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\n\u201cAnd the second issue is the legislative framework required to ensure the legitimacy of elections,\u201d he said.\n\nPreviously, Zelenskyy had pointed out that a ballot can\u2019t legally take place while martial law imposed due to Russia\u2019s invasion nearly four years ago is in place. He has also asked how a vote could happen when civilian areas of Ukraine are being bombarded by Russia and almost 20% of the country is under Russian occupation.\n\nZelenskyy said he has asked lawmakers from his party in Parliament to draw up legislative proposals that would allow elections while Ukraine is under martial law.\n\nUkrainians have on the whole supported Zelenskyy\u2019s arguments, and there has been no clamor in Ukraine for an election. Under the Ukrainian law that is in force, Zelenskyy\u00b4s rule is legitimate.\n\nBut with Trump pressing hard for a deal between Kyiv and Moscow, Zelenskyy is walking a tightrope between defending Ukrainian interests and showing the American president that he is willing to make some compromises.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly complained that Zelenskyy can\u2019t legitimately negotiate a peace settlement because his five-year term in office that began in 2019 has expired.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an important time to hold an election. They\u2019re using war not to hold an election,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Politico, echoing Moscow\u2019s stance.\n\nA new U.S. national security strategy released last Friday made it clear that Trump wants to improve America\u00b4s relationship with Moscow and \u201creestablish strategic stability with Russia.\u201d\n\nThe document also portrays European allies as weak.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday praised Trump\u2019s role in the Ukraine peace effort, saying in a speech at the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia\u2019s Parliament, that Moscow appreciates his \u201ccommitment to dialogue.\u201d Trump, Lavrov said, is \u201cthe only Western leader\u201d who shows \u201can understanding of the reasons that made war in Ukraine inevitable.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s decisions are likely to be pivotal for Ukraine, Washington\u2019s peace efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nTrump\u2019s initial peace proposal was heavily slanted toward Russia\u2019s demands. To counter that, Zelenskyy has turned to his European supporters.\n\nIn recent days, Zelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nZelenskyy said three documents were being discussed with American and European partners \u2013 a 20-point framework document that is constantly changing, a document on security guarantees, and a document about Ukraine\u2019s recovery.\n\nEurope\u2019s support is uneven, however, and that has meant a drop-off in military aid since the Trump administration this year cut off supplies to Kyiv unless they were paid for by other NATO countries.\n\nForeign military help for Ukraine fell sharply over the summer, and that trend continued through September and October, a German body that tracks international help for Ukraine said Wednesday.\n\nAverage annual aid, mostly provided by the U.S. and Europe, was around 41.6 euros billion ($48.4 billion) between 2022-2024. But so far this year Ukraine has received just 32.5 billion euros ($37.8 billion), the Kiel Institute said.\n\n\u201cIf this slower pace continues in the remaining months (of the year), 2025 will become the year with the lowest level of new aid allocations\u201d since the war began, it said.\n\nThis year, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have substantially increased their help for Ukraine, while Germany nearly tripled its average monthly allocations and France and the U.K. both more than doubled their contributions, according to the Kiel Institute.\n\nOn the other hand, it said, Spain recorded no new military aid for Kyiv in 2025 while Italy reduced its low contributions by 15% compared with 2022-2024.",

The first teaser trailer, released this week, showcases some key moments of Bolsonaro\u2019s career, such as his tenure as a Brazilian lawmaker, his marriage to former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro the 2018 failed assassination attempt against him during that year\u2019s presidential campaign, and his recovery.\n\nThe trailer features a cinematic cover of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Survivor, which the singer\u2019s team reportedly claims was used without due authorization.\n\nAnderson Nick, a Brazilian man identified by CNN Brasil as the person in charge of the Brazilian branch of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s charitable foundation BeyGOOD, announced through Instagram that \u201clegal measures\u201d were already being carried to have the trailer taken down as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThank you to everyone who sent me DMs saying that the song \u2018Survivor\u2019 was used in the trailer for the movie about the unmentionable, ineligible, coup-plotting convict,\u201d Nick reportedly wrote on an Instagram story.\n\n\u201cObviously, the song was used without permission, and legal measures are already being taken to have it removed from the air as soon as possible. Thank you,\u201d he concluded.\n\nJail Bolsonaro served as President of Brazil between 2019 and 2022, narrowly losing against current radical socialist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in that year\u2019s election.\n\nThe 70 year-old former President is presently serving a 27 years and 3 months prison sentence on dubious \u201ccharges of \u201ccrimes against democracy.\u201d Bolsonaro was also imposed a 35 year ban from running for office \u2014 as a result, he will only be allowed to run again at the age of 105.\n\nBrazil\u2019s top court, the Supreme Tribunal Federal (STF) has repeatedly rejected granting humanitarian house arrest benefits to Bolsonaro, who in addition to being recently diagnosed with skin cancer, suffers from multiple health conditions, of which the most severe are a direct consequence of the severe internal organ damage caused by the 2018 failed assassination attempt.",

Yet, here was a woman who did everything possible to give her children a competitive advantage, and she was paraded around and made an example of.\"\u00a0</p><p>While Eldridge made it clear that it doesn't make her decisions \"any less wrong,\" it's about perception.</p><p>\"From a public relations standpoint, once the initial dust settled, the average American could relate to her actions,\" he said. \"Granted, they couldn't afford a half-million-dollar bribe like she did, but the desire for our children to do better than we did is a common thread in American society.

On Monday, Paramount launched a $108 billion hostile takeover bid for the entire company, including its cable assets like CNN.</p><p>\"I think there is a very small contingent who wants Paramount... most do not,\" one CNN staffer told <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox News Digital</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/paramount-launches-hostile-takeover-bid-warner-bros-discovery-says-offer-superior-netflix-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>PARAMOUNT LAUNCHES HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID OF WARNER BROS DISCOVERY, SAYS OFFER IS \u2018SUPERIOR\u2019 TO NETFLIX DEAL</u></strong></a></p><p>Leading up to the corporate drama that has unfolded in recent days, CNN's rank and file were not exactly leaping for joy about the prospects of Ellison becoming their new boss.</p><p>\"I don\u2019t think most like it because they fear him meddling,\" the CNN staffer said of Ellison.</p><p>A second CNN staffer noted the \"grim\" mood within the newsroom regarding Ellison.</p><p>\"They see CBS as a complete and utter s--- show, which it was before this to be honest,\" the CNN staffer told Fox News Digital, while conceding \"our organization is also in chaos and crisis.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/trump-warns-netflix-warner-bros-discovery-deal-could-problem-says-hell-involved-decision\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP WARNS NETFLIX-WARNER BROS DISCOVERY DEAL COULD BE A PROBLEM, SAYS HE'LL BE \u2018INVOLVED\u2019 IN DECISION</strong></a></p><p>In August, Ellison took over Paramount as part of its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The deal was plagued by politics as Paramount settled President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump</a>'s election interference lawsuit against the company over CBS News' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kamala Harris</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Liberal critics accused Paramount of \"bending the knee\" to Trump in order for his FCC to approve the merger. They also expressed outrage over <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-cancels-the-late-show-stephen-colbert-end-program-may-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CBS' cancellation</a> of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" which will stop airing after May 2026. The network insisted it was purely a financial decision, though critics believe it was also tied to the FCC-approved merger.\u00a0</p><p>CBS News, the perpetual third place broadcaster behind ABC News and NBC News' weekday programming, has undergone some major changes in Ellison's first few months as its owner, from implementing a brutal round of layoffs, tapping Bari Weiss as the network's editor-in-chief, to pushing out \"CBS Evening News\" anchors John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois. Weiss is reportedly eying \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil to take the chair.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/senate-gears-up-intense-antitrust-hearing-wake-netflix-warner-bros-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>SENATE GEARS UP FOR 'INTENSE' ANTITRUST HEARING IN WAKE OF NETFLIX, WARNER BROS DEAL</u></strong></a></p><p>CNN staffers fear that the editorial reshaping of CBS News by Ellison and Weiss would impact their own newsroom if Paramount buys Warner Bros. Discovery. They also worry about a potential \"bloodbath\" among leadership if CBS News and CNN were to merge.\u00a0</p><p>\"They like editorial independence, and I think the reports of what CBS has gone through suggests that may not be the case where there to be a Paramount takeover,\" the first CNN staffer said.</p><p>During a CNBC interview on Monday, Ellison was asked whether he would combine CNN and CBS News' newsgathering operations. He dodged the question, speaking instead about the broader goal he has for news, which is getting into the \"trust\" and \"truth business\" that \"speaks to the 70% of Americans in the middle,\" a sentiment previously echoed by Weiss.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bari-weiss-reportedly-stunned-60-minutes-crew-asking-why-country-thinks-theyre-biased-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>BARI WEISS REPORTEDLY 'STUNNED' '60 MINUTES' CREW BY ASKING WHY THE COUNTRY THINKS THEY'RE 'BIASED': REPORT</strong></a></p><p>However, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-netflix-warner-bros-battle-ellisons-a86fe15c?st=6zkB6m&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">reported</a> that Ellison had told Trump officials that he'd make sweeping changes to CNN if he became its owner, and that Trump has been vocal about wanting CNN to have new ownership that will make programming changes.</p><p>\"I think everyone wants to be fair,\" the CNN staffer said. \"I don't think [CNN colleagues] see Ellison as trying to target the political middle. I think they think he is kowtowing to Trump.\"</p><p>Trump himself has so far had a more agnostic approach to the bidding war despite his reported coziness with Ellison and his billionaire father Larry Ellison. Last week, he praised Netflix as a \"great company\" and called its CEO Ted Sarandos a \"fantastic man\" but expressed concern about its market share. On Monday, he refrained from saying he supported Paramount's bid despite it being partially financed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner's private equity firm Affinity Partners, something Trump told reporters he hadn't discussed with Kushner about.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-unloads-cbs-60-minutes-over-marjorie-taylor-greenes-interview-demands-apology-rips-ownership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blasted Paramount</a> over the \"60 Minutes\" interview featuring ally-turned-foe Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., writing on Truth Social that the new ownership is \"NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP.\"</p><p>CNN has repeatedly been orphaned by corporate parents for years, from Time Warner in the 90s, to AOL in the early 2000s, to AT&amp;T in 2018, leading to its 2022 spinoff of Warner Bros. Discovery, led by CEO David Zaslav.</p><p>\"I remember when AT&amp;T was seen as horrific. Looking back, it\u2019s the best owner we\u2019ve had in a decade,\" the second CNN staffer said. \"They left us alone. That\u2019s all any news organization wants. They plowed money into us. And yeah, Zaslav dumped CNN+\u00a0on like the second day or whatever. But AT&amp;T put in 600 million bucks.\"</p><p>Not everyone at CNN is hitting the panic button on Ellison. The second staffer told Fox News Digital that they'll be \"open-minded\" if he takes over. The staffer also called Weiss \"very thoughtful and very confident,\" which could be a \"very good combo.\"</p><p>\"I hope I'll be pleasantly surprised,\" they said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-snags-abc-reporter-who-apologized-remarks-about-charlie-kirk-shooters-touching-messages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CBS SNAGS ABC REPORTER WHO APOLOGIZED FOR REMARKS ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK'S ALLEGED SHOOTER'S 'TOUCHING' MESSAGES</strong></a></p><p>A third CNN staffer suggested that Paramount buying the network would be the better outcome versus being spun off if Netflix buys Warner Bros. and being \"totally chopped to pieces and whittled to the bone private equity style.\"</p><p>Regardless, the agony of CNN's unknown future is only fueling anxiety in the newsroom.</p><p>\"Most people have no idea what will happen... The uncertainty is the worst of all,\" the first CNN staffer said.</p><p>Representatives for CNN and Warner Bros. Discovery did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. A spokesperson for Paramount declined to comment.\u00a0</p>",

    "content": "<p>As he's done so many times, Buffalo Bills MVP quarterback <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/josh-allen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Josh Allen</a> scrambled outside the pocket on a snowy Highmark Stadium turf, surveying the field through flurries while defenders were crashing down on him.\u00a0</p><p>It was a 14-3 game in favor of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-burrow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joe Burrow</a> and the Cincinnati Bengals, a game in which the Bills needed to win to keep their AFC East division hopes alive, while maintaining a strong playoff case. So, as Allen does, he finds a way to get the job done despite the circumstances.\u00a0</p><p>Somehow, some way, he noticed his trusty receiver, Khalil Shakir, dashing around the end zone on fourth-and-4 from the Cincinnati 11-yard line. But anyone in Western New York, and watching at home, wouldn't have batted an eye if Allen didn't throw a pass to the No. 10 jersey he saw streaking through Bengals secondary personnel \u2013 why risk a turnover?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON </strong></a><a href=\"http://FOXNEWS.COM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>Not Allen, though. With a rifle for an arm and confidence that always seemed to be bigger than the moment itself, he threw a seed to Shakir, hitting him between the numbers for a much-needed Bills touchdown in the second quarter.\u00a0</p><p>Surprised? Shakir isn't at this point of his career.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think he\u2019s done it so much that I am just used to it,\" Shakir smiled as he told Fox News Digital about his fourth touchdown of the season, while also highlighting his partnership with Kelley Blue Book.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/super-bowl-lix-star-quarterbacks-struggle-crucial-point-2025-season\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SUPER BOWL LIX STAR QUARTERBACKS STRUGGLE AT CRUCIAL POINT OF 2025 SEASON</strong></a></p><p>Whether it's his arm, legs, or preferably both, it seems Allen is making these highlight-reel plays each week for the Bills. After all, winning MVP means going above and beyond, and Allen has been the epitome of that for this franchise since he was taken in the first round in 2018.\u00a0</p><p>Shakir couldn't be more confident saying his quarterback is the best player in the NFL, but Allen will even tell you winning MVP, and a hopeful <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/super-bowl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Super Bowl</a> for his Bills, requires everyone to do their part.\u00a0</p><p>Shakir, who signed a four-year extension with the Bills in February, understands his role. Always expect the ball, even if you have multiple defenders around in snowy conditions while you're slipping and sliding on the turf.\u00a0</p><p>\"In those scramble-play moments, being a skill player on the field just to make yourself available for him as much as you can,\" Shakir explained. \"He\u2019s the best player in the entire league and has the ability to make these insane plays literally whenever he wants to. Knowing that he trusts us to make those catches, I think gives him comfort in making that type of throw.\"</p><p>Shakir was a fifth-round pick by the Bills out of Boise State in 2022, and last year saw his best production with 821 yards on 76 receptions (100 targets). He proved to be a reliable target for Allen, building that trust factor after tallying 611 yards on 39 grabs in 2023.</p><p>Trust is the only way plays like that on Sunday against the Bengals can work, and it\u2019s something Shakir takes pride in.</p><p>\"I had a shallow route and then tried to run to the sideline and it got blocked off, so I just started running up the field.

He was reinstated with the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, which eliminated the automatic disqualification for marrying a Catholic.</p><p>Andrew <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/prince-andrew\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stepped back as a working royal</a> in 2019 after his disastrous BBC interview explaining his friendship with Epstein, who died that year in jail while facing sex-trafficking charges involving minors. Before she died in 2022, the queen stripped her son of his military titles and patronages.</p><p>Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Virginia Giuffre, an American woman who alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with the royal three times. The settlement, made for an undisclosed sum, included no admission of liability.</p><p>Giuffre, who died in April, alleged in previous legal filings that Epstein arranged for her to meet Andrew at age 17. Emails leaked in recent months also suggested Andrew was <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jeffrey-epstein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in contact with Epstein</a> after claiming to have severed ties.</p><p>Andrew, 65, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>After months of political debate, Congress passed \u2014 and President Donald Trump signed \u2014 legislation compelling the Justice Department to release all files related to Epstein before Christmas, The Associated Press reported.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS</u></strong></a></p><p>This could renew scrutiny of Andrew\u2019s past ties to Epstein and cast a darker shadow over the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/british-royals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">House of Windsor</a>. Experts warned that new claims or allegations could still emerge, and a swift parliamentary move would send a message of accountability.</p><p>\"Removal from the line of succession would require complex legislation and consent from the Commonwealth realms, making it highly unlikely,\" Chard said. \"However, could public pressure force the symbolic removal of Andrew from the line of succession? Andrew could be removed if found guilty of misconduct.\"</p><p>\"King Charles has already asserted the royal prerogative as far as he can for now,\" Fordwich explained. \"He\u2019s used royal warrants and administrative changes to remove Andrew\u2019s titles and official roles, rebranding him simply as Mr. Andrew. He\u2019s also ousting him from Royal Lodge.\"</p><p>\"The existing legal framework of hereditary succession \u2014 as a blood descendant of Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 must be altered by Parliament and all Commonwealth realms,\" Fordwich noted. \"Andrew could also voluntarily abdicate his claim, but that\u2019s highly unlikely.\"</p><p>Fordwich added that there is a deliberate separation between hereditary right and court favor to prevent any one faction from wielding excessive power.</p><p>\"The system is designed so that a monarch can\u2019t simply erase on a whim any relatives from the line of succession for either personal or political reasons,\" said Fordwich. \"Historically, this has always been viewed as a rather sensible safeguard, ensuring constitutional stability.\"</p><p>Andrew\u2019s daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, still hold their titles as granddaughters of a sovereign. According to royal experts, the princesses are welcomed by the king to help support the monarchy with royal duties.</p><p>The former Duke of York is expected to move to a property on the king\u2019s Sandringham estate. He will also receive private financial support from his brother, 77, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/illness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">who continues cancer treatment</a>.</p><p>Historian Andrew Lownie, who recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote a biography of Andrew</a>, believes there are grounds to further investigate possible past misconduct while the prince held public office.</p><p><strong>WATCH: PRINCE ANDREW, JEFFREY EPSTEIN HAD MONEY AND SEX IN COMMON: AUTHOR</strong></p><p>\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the end of it, I think there are many more disclosures to come,\" Lownie warned the BBC.</p>",

NY Post Design\n\n\u201cSwitching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department\u2019s official correspondence,\u201d Rubio wrote in an \u201caction request,\u201d obtained by Reuters and the New York Times.\n\nTimes New Roman has long been a classic letterhead in books, featuring narrower and more formally shaped letters relative to Calibri.\n\nThe State Department used Times New Roman as its official font starting in 2004, when it shifted away from Courier New, a typeface frequently used in screenplays with its monospaced letters.\n\nRubio reportedly dinged the Blinken-era switch to Calibri as \u201cwasteful\u201d and woke in his Dec. 9 cable to personnel.\n\n\u201cTo restore decorum and professionalism to the Department\u2019s written work products and abolish yet another wasteful DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility] program, the Department is returning to Times New Roman as its standard typeface,\u201d Rubio reportedly wrote.\n\n\u201cThis formatting standard aligns with the President\u2019s One Voice for America\u2019s Foreign Relations directive, underscoring the Department\u2019s responsibility to present a unified, professional voice in all communications.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the Blinken-era switch to Calibri, the State Department had pointed to studies suggesting the wider typeface was more readable for people with visual disabilities \u2014 a conclusion that has split experts.\n\nDuring President Trump\u2019s second term, his team has sought to scrap Biden-era diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies within the government and encourage the private sector to do the same.",

Duke and UNT are in the CFP. The entire G5 debate is turned on its head, with the conversation about why a 3 loss Duke team is in over JMU. \n\n* Florida\u2019s fanbase is melting down over firing Napier, missing on Kiffen, and settling for \u201cG5 Golesh.\u201d\n\n\nWhat about your team?

Featured pricing is subject to change.\n\nWe\u2019re drawn to this lip look.\n\nSofia Richie Grainge recently shared her latest lip combo on TikTok, immediately catching our attention (and racking up over two million views). The designer and model often opts for a 90s-inspired brown lip liner, paired with a gloss or stain for a sultry, on-trend look that\u2019s easy to wear.\n\nSo, it was fairly unsurprising when she began by lining her pout with the cult-favorite Makeup For Ever Artist Color Pencil, also a go-to for Hailey Bieber, Jennifer Lopez, Sabrina Carpenter, Suni Lee and many other stars.\n\nThe pinky-brown, soft contrast lip is a staple both on the red carpet and off. (Though the creamy, long-wear pencil can also be used on eyes or brows, making it a versatile makeup bag hero.)\n\nMakeup For Ever\n\nThe brand confirmed that Richie Grainge is using Anywhere Caffeine, a warm, caramel nude shade also adored by Bieber.\n\nThe multi-purpose pencil also comes in several gorgeous nudes and browns, from Lee\u2019s favorite Whatever Walnut to Endless Cacao. (We even found a giftable kit with five mini favorites.)\n\nRichie Grainge uses hers to fill in the outer parts of her lips, before applying Summer Fridays Dream Lip Oil in one of the soft pink mauve shades.\n\nSummer Fridays\n\nSummer Fridays is a staple line for the star, who has posted several times using the brand\u2019s Lip Butter Balm (practically every editor also has it in their bag).\n\nRichie Grainge\u2019s recent TikTok shared a nude lip combo we love. TikTok/SofiaRichie\n\nThe vitamin E-packed Dream Lip Oil offers the same lip-loving moisture, with nine plant-based oils, but has more shine and tint. (This combo is so pretty for everyday, but also a match with a smoky eye.)\n\nShoppers give the lip oil rave reviews, with one on Amazon sharing, \u201cThe bottle is so pretty, and the color is fresh and vibrant. The lip oil leaves your lips hydrated with a beautiful tint. I bought this for my tween, and she loves it!\u201d\n\nWhy Trust Page Six Style Shopping\n\nThis article was written by Erica Radol, Page Six Commerce Reporter. From identifying the top anti-aging skincare secrets the stars trust to pinpointing the season\u2019s next big fashion trends to finding a great deal on all of the above, Erica has a knack for reporting on \u2013 and even testing \u2013 Hollywood\u2019s bestselling fashion and beauty products.

Roxanna Valenzuela/Instagram\n\nAnd amid it all, the former mayor tells us\u2026 he\u2019s in love!\n\nIt recently came to light that the lefty pol began an affair with South Tucson mayor Roxanna Valenzuela while he was still seeing now ex, political strategist Nomiki Konst, who he\u2019d been dating for nearly a year.\n\nBut now a source tells us that de Blasio and Valenzuela first met for a business lunch in September \u2014 more than a month before he split from Konst \u2014 and the pair went back to his apartment to have sex.\n\n8 They met up two days later to volunteer at a soup kitchen. Roxanna Valenzuela/Instagram\n\n8 De Blasio was dating political strategist Nomiki Kost at the time. Stefan Jeremiah\n\nJust two days later Valenzuela took him to volunteer at a soup kitchen and once again, tins of split pea soup weren\u2019t the only cans Hizzoner got his hands on, says a source.\n\nMeanwhile, the former mayor was still seeing progressive activist and former \u201cYoung Turks\u201d correspondent Konst.\n\nA source tells us de Blasio \u2014 who ran the city from 2014 to 2021 \u2014 came clean to her about the steamy dalliance while they were on a vacation in Greece just days after the saucy soup kitchen tryst when she was in the midst of a round of IVF for egg freezing. (She and de Blasio weren\u2019t planning to have kids, we\u2019re told).\n\nA source close to Konst tells us the pair attempted to get their relationship back on track.\n\n8 The pair had been together for ten months. Instagram/@nomikikonst\n\n8 We hear the former mayor fessed up to the affair while they were on vacation in Greece. Instagram/@nomikikonst\n\nBut on November 4, we\u2019re told that Konst \u201clearned he was still talking to Roxanna and [Roxanna] was coming to NYC [to see him] while they were walking into Zohran Mamdani\u2019s election night victory party.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re told press cameras were snapping away as Konst processed the devastating news.\n\nNow de Blasio tells Page Six that he \u201cfell in love\u201d with Valenzuela.\n\n\u201cI wish Nomiki well and I\u2019m sorry for how our relationship ended,\u201d he told us. \u201cI fell in love with someone else and I should have told her sooner. I\u2019m now in a wonderful relationship with Roxanna Valenzuela that we will continue to nurture and keep private.\u201d\n\n8 The final straw came during Zohran Mamdani\u2019s election night party. Instagram/@nomikikonst\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to comment on the more sordid details of their initial meeting, de Blasio told us, \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\n\nThere was no response to request for comment from Valenzuela or Konst.\n\nDe Blasio, 64, and Valenzuela, 41, were snapped posing together over the weekend in Arizona at a swearing-in ceremony for newly elected Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva.\n\nBut we hear Konst, 41, has also moved on.\n\nA spy tells us they spotted the political commentator at the Hellenic Initiative Gala at Cipriani Wall Street this weekend, posing for pics with a hunky Staten Island firefighter named Keith Tavella.\n\n8 De Blasio was spotted with Valenzuela in Arizona this weekend and tells us he is \u201cin love.\u201d Roxanna Valenzuela/Instagram\n\n\u201cIt seems like an upgrade,\u201d said a source of the new man, who they noted seemed much younger than de Blasio.\n\nDe Blasio has two children with Chirlane McCray, who formerly identified as a lesbian. The pair separated in 2023 and do not intend to divorce.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s messy love life has made headlines since he and McCray split.\n\n8 Konst appears to have moved on with fireman Keith Tavella. Instagram/nomikikonst\n\nHe was spotted making out at Empire Rooftop Bar with a mystery woman for three hours in September 2023, and was seen a few months later taking a married woman, Kristy Stark, on a romantic stroll through Manhattan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about my wife holding hands with Bill de Blasio,\u201d that married woman\u2019s befuddled husband, Owen Stark, told The Post at the time.\n\nStark later said she and her husband were \u201cin the process of getting a divorce,\u201d which also came as a surprise to her husband.",

We\u2019re to a point in our lives where we just wanna do songs that we love, and then see what happens, I guess, later.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the rumors continued as Stefani failed to post any photos of Shelton to her social media for most of the summer and fall.\n\n7 The couple have been battling split rumors for months now. Gwen Stefani/Instagram\n\n7 They have been married since 2021. Gwen Stefani/Instagram\n\n7 Stefani made sure her wedding ring was on full display at a recent red carpet event. CCNYC-OWF / BACKGRID\n\nHowever, over Thanksgiving, the \u201cJust a Girl\u201d singer shared a loved-up pic of the two of them before making sure her wedding ring was in full view during a solo red carpet outing.\n\nStefani also confirmed that there was no trouble in paradise when she revealed their holiday plans.\n\n\u201cBlake and I, we just bounce back and forth between Oklahoma constantly. This December, we\u2019re going back there, and then we\u2019re going to bounce back to [Los Angeles],\u201d she said on the Dec. 4 episode of the \u201cToday\u201d show.",

You can give up pencils,\" <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/09/trump-affordability-pennsylvania/\">said</a> President Donald Trump at a speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, that was supposed to help alleviate people's worries about affordability and help Republicans figure out salient messaging ahead of the midterms.</p>\n<p>What a fascinating tack to take.</p>\n<p>\"You always need steel. You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter,\" he continued. \"Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls. So, we're doing things right. We're running this country right well.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that,\" said Trump. \"But they use the word affordability.<i>\u00a0</i>And that's the only word they say. Affordability. And that's their only word. They say, 'Affordability.' And everyone says, 'Oh, that must mean Trump has high prices.' No. Our prices are coming down tremendously from the highest prices in the history of our country.\"</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, this is true: Inflation reached its <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/economy/cpi-inflation-june/index.html\">year-over-year high</a> in June 2022, during Joe Biden's presidency, when it broke 9 percent. It has since been tamed. But the Trump economy is rather, uh, bad. And it's unforced errors all the way down: Tariffs aren't necessary or wise or especially conservative (though <a href=\"https://x.com/carney/status/1998560873879843014?s=20\">he's worked on rebranding them</a> as such). The economic hardship imposed wipes out any revenue gains, and then some. \"The Trump tariffs amount to an average\u00a0<span class=\"glossary-term\"><a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/tax/\">tax</a><cite class=\"glossary-term-summary\"></cite></span> increase per US household of $1,100 in 2025 and $1,400 in 2026,\" <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/\">report</a> Tax Foundation's Erica York and Alex Durante. They continue, \"The Trump tariffs are the largest US tax increase as a percent of GDP (0.47 percent for 2025) since 1993.\" Many companies will choose not to do business in the U.S., and many U.S. businesses that relied on foreign imports will have to change their methods or simply shoulder higher costs that will inevitably be passed on to consumers. Some will just close up shop.</p>\n<p>Trump, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/12/09/trump-affordability-pennsylvania/\">in his Pennsylvania speech</a>, displays approximately zero self-awareness and shares no admissions of guilt: \"I mean, the only thing that is really going up big, it's called the stock market and your 401(k).\" But people aren't fools. They see the rise in grocery prices reflected in their household budgets; the fact that it's harder to get goods to arrive on time; the fact that large manufacturers are now running into real supply chain issues (after a summer and fall of stockpiling that made it so most consumers didn't feel the tariff effects until somewhat recently). Is the rhetorical approach of \"you can just give up things you want\" actually a winner? Trump seems to think so. Color me skeptical.</p>\n<p><strong>Social media surveillance for visa-free visitors:\u00a0</strong>U.S. Customs and Border Protection is <a href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-22461.pdf\">going to start</a> \"adding social media as a mandatory data element\" that they consider <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/us-plans-to-mandate-social-media-checks-for-visa-free-visitors?srnd=homepage-americas\">when screening people</a> entering the country under the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of places like Australia, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. to enter visa-free.</p>\n<p>This raises questions. Can you just pretend you don't have social media accounts? What exactly would they find disqualifying? Also, is this really the highest and best use of these agents' time? Attempting to very tightly control who enters this country would make sense if we had some sort of massive wave of radicalism and extremist violence fomented by people from these places who are entering via the Visa Waiver Program\u2014but we don't. We don't even have much of an issue with these passport holders overstaying their visas. Like so many things the Trump administration does, it's a solution in search of a problem.</p>\n<p>The new screening \"would apply to travelers from about 40 countries who can stay in the US for up to 90 days without a visa and are screened before travel under an electronic system known as ESTA,\" <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/us-plans-to-mandate-social-media-checks-for-visa-free-visitors?srnd=homepage-americas\">reports</a>\u00a0<em>Bloomberg.\u00a0</em>It's \"the latest in a series of measures from the Trump administration aimed at restricting entry,\" including \"<a class=\"media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/trump-to-expand-travel-ban-to-around-30-countries-after-shooting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-component=\"link\">a planned travel ban</a> for around 30 countries announced this month following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington.\" But the suspect in that shooting, keen observers might note, was not visiting from Germany or Australia; he was \"an Afghan national who worked with US forces and the CIA in Afghanistan before arriving in the US in 2021.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Scenes from New York:\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">the rapid rise of &quot;private members clubs&quot; in new york is a useful phenomena to watch. these clubs aren&#39;t &quot;private&quot; in any real sense, they simply exist to enforce norms (don&#39;t overhear people, don&#39;t photograph people, no fighting) that were enforced societally but are no longer <a href=\"https://t.co/rga8oHKfrb\">https://t.co/rga8oHKfrb</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Will Manidis (@WillManidis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillManidis/status/1995881329926262929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>QUICK HITS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>At long last, the <em>Reason</em> Webathon has concluded.

And warnings of the decline in test scores have been dramatically overstated.\" I have to lodge my disagreement with Cowen here: Maybe the concerns are more minor for children whose parents set controls and limits, but I'm very worried about attention-span bifurcation, in which some number of children have their attention spans safeguarded from a very young age in some form and other children have iPad <em>Cocomelon</em>-ed(or worse) <em>Clockwork Orange-</em>d into their eyeballs from the age of 12 months onward, thus hindering them from developing any semblance of focus.</li>\n<li>\"Over the past decade, a growing number of adolescents [in the Netherlands] have applied for assisted death for relief from irremediable psychiatric suffering from conditions such as eating disorders and anxiety,\" <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/09/science/medically-assisted-dying-laws.html\">reports</a>\u00a0<em>The New York Times.\u00a0</em>The Dutch government's decision to allow assisted suicide for minors is rather controversial, and \"public concern over a few high-profile cases of teens who received assisted deaths prompted the country's regulator to consider a moratorium on approvals for children applying on the basis of psychiatric suffering.\"</li>\n<li>\"Last month, <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/11/14/12th-grade-girls-are-less-likely-than-boys-to-say-they-want-to-get-married-someday/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pew Research Center compared</a> data from 1993 and 2023, finding 12th-grade boys are more likely than 12th-grade girls to say they want to get married someday, a flip from three decades ago,\" <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/09/men-women-marriage/\">writes</a> Emily Jashinsky for <em>The Washington Post. </em>\"Boys' plans for marriage have barely budged since 1993, dropping to 74 percent from 76 percent.

If 6 in 10 girls still say they want to get married, what's going on with the two who changed their minds since 1993? A January paper summarized by the <a href=\"https://aibm.org/research/will-college-educated-women-find-someone-to-marry/\">American Institute for Boys and Men found</a>: 'Historical data show that when men's educational and economic outcomes decline, it is women without a college degree who experience the sharpest declines in marriage rates.'

    "content": "<p>From yesterday's decision by Texas Court of Appeals Justice Katy Boatman in <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/texas/fourteenth-court-of-appeals/2025-14-24-00828-cv.pdf?ts=1765287560\"><em>Daly v. Lehle</em></a>, joined by Justices Chad Bridges and Maritza Ant\u00fa:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This appeal matches pickleball against tennis&hellip;. Defendant served as chairwoman of the courts for the Coles Crossing community, looking after the interests of local tennis players and ensuring that the community's tennis courts were well-maintained. Defendant gave monthly reports at the Coles Crossing homeowners' association board meetings.</p>\n<p>Coles Crossing residents suggested the community install pickleball courts, so the HOA board set up an exploratory pickleball committee with members representing mixed interests: Plaintiff (team pickleball) was committee head and Defendant (team tennis) was one of several committee members. Things quickly soured, as the parties disagreed about the extent to which the tennis courts should be modified so they could double as pickleball courts.</p>\n<p>During this time, Defendant also permitted a local tennis professional to use the courts to teach tennis lessons to children from the community. According to Defendant, she \"received calls from at least four parents of clinic participants relaying serious concerns that an anonymous adult man was using his personal cell phone to take pictures of their young children doing drills on the tennis courts.\" Two HOA board members explained to Defendant that Plaintiff was taking the photographs to document HOA rules violations\u2014namely, allowing a tennis professional to use multiple courts simultaneously. Plaintiff said he also relayed the reason for his photographs to Defendant.</p>\n<p>Three months later, Defendant opened her monthly tennis report at the HOA board meeting by lobbing an accusation: she, \"as a former teacher,\" had a \"duty to report instances of sexual exploitation of minor children through photographs and videography.\" Defendant accused Plaintiff \"of taking photographs of children for inappropriate purposes\" and \"implied that [he] was a pervert, pedophile, or sexual predator.\" Multiple community members complained to the HOA board about Defendant's statements&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Plaintiff sued, and the court held the case could go forward:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360328\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>The TCPA [Texas Citizens Participation Act] aims to protect citizens who associate, petition, or speak on matters of public concern from retaliatory lawsuits that seek to intimidate or silence them. That protection comes in the form of a \"special motion to dismiss\" any suit that \"appears to stifle the defendant's exercise of those rights.\"</p>\n<p>The burden in a TCPA motion to dismiss volleys back and forth between the parties. First, the movant must demonstrate that the TCPA applies and show by a preponderance of the evidence that the legal action is based on or in response to the movant's exercise of the rights to associate, speak freely, or petition. If the movant clears this burden, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to establish by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of its claim. Finally, if the nonmovant satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts back to the movant to establish as a matter of law any valid affirmative defenses. Ultimately, a TCPA motion to dismiss is not the forum for deciding the winner; it simply decides whether the nonmovant has enough evidence to move to the next round&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Because the TCPA applies to Plaintiff's claims, the ball is in Plaintiff's court to provide prima facie evidence to support his defamation claim&hellip;. Plaintiff must show (1) publication of a false statement of fact to a third party, (2) that was defamatory concerning the plaintiff, (3) with the requisite degree of fault, and (4) damages, in some cases&hellip;.</p>\n<p>[1] Plaintiff must first provide clear and specific evidence that the statement was made and was a statement of fact, which depends on its verifiability and the entire context in which it was made&hellip;. Plaintiff makes this shot &hellip;, at least at the TCPA stage. Plaintiff stated in his declaration that Defendant \"accused [him] of taking photographs of children for inappropriate purposes and implied that [he] was a pervert, pedophile or sexual predator.\" Rather than dealing with these concerns privately, she decided to take them to the court of public opinion: an HOA board meeting that was open to the public and had \"a large audience.\"</p>\n<p>Other evidence also gives the advantage to Plaintiff's claims. The declaration from HOA board president Derek Hooper stated that the challenged statements were made at a board meeting attended by approximately 35-40 people&hellip;. Hooper said he \"understood that [Defendant] was accusing [Plaintiff] of being a pervert, pedophile, or sexual predator because of her previous complaints about [Plaintiff].\" The declaration from HOA board secretary Sarah Green also stated that she \"understood that [Defendant] was publicly accusing [Plaintiff] of being a pervert, pedophile or sexual predator.\" &hellip;</p>\n<p>Defendant tries to sideline Plaintiff's affidavits by saying they present nothing more than conclusory statements. A conclusory statement is one that expresses a factual inference without providing underlying facts to support that conclusion. But here, the statements in the declarations go beyond mere conclusions and provide sufficient underlying facts to show when, where, and what was said as necessary to support Plaintiff's defamation claim.</p>\n<p>[2.] Plaintiff must next present evidence showing that Defendant's statements were reasonably capable of defamatory meaning, which we examine from the perspective of an ordinary person in light of the surrounding circumstances. Defamation per se refers to statements that are so obviously harmful that general damages may be presumed. \"Accusing someone of a crime, of having a foul or loathsome disease, or of engaging in serious sexual misconduct are examples of defamation per se.\"</p>\n<p>Here, the evidence shows that Defendant said Plaintiff was taking photographs of children for \"inappropriate purposes\" and implied that he was a \"pervert, pedophile or sexual predator.\" An ordinary person would understand these statements to accuse Plaintiff of serious sexual misconduct; therefore, they constitute defamation per se and general damages may be presumed.</p>\n<p>Defendant argues that her comments do not qualify as an actionable false statement of fact or a statement implying any undisclosed facts, but that argument is out of bounds. Courts across Texas have held that similar statements are verifiable statements of fact that keep a defamation claim in play&hellip;.</p>\n<p>[3.] Defendant asserts that Plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure, meaning he must serve up evidence of actual malice to maintain his defamation claim. A three-part test determines whether a defamation claimant is a limited-purpose public figure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the controversy at issue must be public both in the sense that people are discussing it and people other than the immediate participants in the controversy are likely to feel the impact of its resolution;</li>\n<li>the plaintiff must have more than a trivial or tangential role in the controversy; and</li>\n<li>the alleged defamation must be germane to the plaintiff's participation in the controversy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These requirements are satisfied here. The tennis versus pickleball debate was a matter of public controversy in the Coles Crossing community, the net effect of which would affect community members' ability to play at their local courts. Plaintiff was a major player in the controversy, as head of the exploratory pickleball committee. Finally, the alleged defamatory statements were related to Plaintiff's role in the controversy, <em>i.e.</em>, the reason he was taking photographs during a children's tennis clinic.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the deciding point at this stage is whether Plaintiff brought forth prima facie evidence of actual malice\u2014that the defamatory statements were published with either knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for their truth. To show a reckless disregard for the truth, the plaintiff \"must establish that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the publication or had a high degree of awareness of the probable falsity of the published information.\"</p>\n<p>Plaintiff made the required showing: Defendant had twice been informed of the legitimate reasons for Plaintiff's photographs, but persisted in accusing Plaintiff of inappropriate purposes. Hooper said he and two other board members scheduled a meeting with Defendant after the board meeting to address \"her persistent pattern of disruptive conduct.\" According to Hooper, Defendant \"admitted &hellip; that she should not have made the derogatory comments about [Plaintiff] and acknowledged that she was wrong about [Plaintiff] being a pervert, pedophile or sexual predator\"\u2014further showing that Defendant made the statements with reckless disregard for their truth. Taken together and viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, this constitutes prima facie evidence that Defendant made the alleged defamatory statements with a high degree of awareness of their probable falsity.</p>\n<p>Defendant makes two arguments in response. She first argues that a subsequent apology is not evidence of actual malice. But the Supreme Court of Texas has held that that the actual malice standard was satisfied where defendant\u2014unprompted\u2014\"expressed doubt to a friend that there was any basis for the charges he was making.\" This is especially true here because of the direct evidence that Defendant had been told of the innocent purpose for the pictures multiple times before the meeting. Defendant's second serve fails too: she argues that Plaintiff's actual motive in taking the pictures is \"unverifiable,\" but all that is required at this stage is \"a rational inference that the allegation of fact is true.\" Plaintiff has met that standard&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the court concluded that plaintiffs' intentional infliction of emotional dismiss claim was duplicative of the defamation claim and should be dismissed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>IIED is not an ace; it is merely a \"'gap-filler' tort, judicially created for the limited purpose of allowing recovery in those rare instances in which a defendant intentionally inflicts severe emotional distress in a manner so unusual that the victim has no other recognized theory of redress.\" Accordingly, \"[w]here the gravamen of a plaintiff's complaint is really another tort, [IIED] should not be available.\" &hellip;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/10/pickleball-vs-tennis-leads-to-defamation-lawsuit/\">Pickleball vs. Tennis Leads to Defamation Lawsuit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

This false perception equates physical acts that can injure or kill people with disagreements and insults that might cause hurt feelings and potentially justifies responding to the latter with the former. After all, if words are violence, why not rebut a verbal sparring partner with an actual punch? Unfortunately, the idea is embedded on college campuses where a majority of undergraduate students agree that words and violence can be the same thing.</p>\n\n<h1>Most Believe Words Can Be Violence</h1>\n<p>\"Ninety one percent of undergraduate students believe that words can be violence, according to a new poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression [FIRE] and College Pulse,\" FIRE <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/news/fire-poll-90-undergrads-believe-words-can-be-violence-even-after-killing-charlie-kirk\">announced</a> last week. \"The survey's findings are especially startling coming in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination\u2014an extreme and tragic example of the sharp difference between words and violence.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/how-assassination-charlie-kirk-reshaping-campus-speech-nationwide\">survey</a> posed questions about speech and political violence to undergraduate students at Utah Valley University, where Kirk was murdered, and at colleges elsewhere\u20142,028 students overall. FIRE and College Pulse compared the student responses to those of members of the general public who were <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/24/most-americans-think-free-speech-is-on-the-decline-survey-finds/\">separately polled</a>.</p>\n<p>Specifically, one question asked how much \"words can be violence\" described respondents' thoughts. Twenty-two percent of college undergraduates answered that the sentiment \"describes my thoughts completely,\" 25 percent said it \"mostly\" described their thoughts, 28 percent put it at \"somewhat,\" and 15 percent answered \"slightly.\" Only 9 percent answered that the \"words can be violence\" sentiment \"does not describe my thoughts at all.\"</p>\n<p>It's difficult to get too worked up about those who \"slightly\" believe words can be violence, but that still leaves us at 75 percent of the student population. And almost half of students \"completely\" or \"mostly\" see words and violence as essentially the same thing. That's a lot of young people who struggle to distinguish between an unwelcome expression and a punch to the nose.</p>\n<p>Depressingly, <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/24/most-americans-think-free-speech-is-on-the-decline-survey-finds/\">34 percent of the general public \"completely\" or \"mostly\" agree</a>. Fifty-nine percent at least \"somewhat\" believe words can be violence.</p>\n<p>In 2017, when the conflation of words and violence was relatively new, Jonathan Haidt, a New York University psychology professor, worried that the false equivalence fed into the <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/mental-health/latest-federal-data-show-that-young-people-are-more-likely-than-older-adults-to-be-experiencing-symptoms-of-anxiety-or-depression/\">simmering mental health crisis</a> among <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11790661/\">young people</a>. He and FIRE President Greg Lukianoff <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/\">wrote</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em> that \"growing numbers of college students have become less able to cope with the challenges of campus life, including offensive ideas, insensitive professors, and rude or even racist and sexist peers\" and that the rise in mental health issues \"is better understood as a crisis of resilience.\"</p>\n<h1>Conflating Words and Violence Encourages Violence</h1>\n<p>Telling young people who haven't been raised to be resilient and to deal with the certainty of encountering debate, disagreement, and rude or hateful expressions in an intellectually and ideologically diverse world plays into problems with anxiety and depression. It teaches that the world is more dangerous than it actually is rather than a place that requires a certain degree of toughness. Worse, if words are violence it implies that responding \"in kind\" is justified.</p>\n<p>\"At a time of rapidly rising political polarization in America, it helps a small subset of that generation justify political violence,\" Haidt and Lukianoff added.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, last week Gallup <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/697745/youth-loneliness-political-violence.aspx\">reported</a> that \"age is the strongest predictor of attitudes toward political violence, with young adults aged 18\u201329 more likely than other age groups to say that it is sometimes OK to use violence to achieve a political goal.\" Thirty percent of respondents 18\u201329 say it is \"sometimes\" acceptable to use violence to achieve political goals, compared to 21 percent of those 30\u201344, 13 percent of those 45\u201359, and 4 percent of people 60 and older.</p>\n<p>And yes, acceptance of political violence has changed over the tears. For those 18 to 29, it was 22 percent in 1970 and 21 percent in 1995. For 30-to-44-year-olds, it was 16 percent in 1970 and 15 percent in 1995. The percentage remained largely unchanged for those 45\u201359 and dropped for people over 60.</p>\n<p>Kirk was <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/22/americas-free-speech-culture-is-under-attack-from-within/\">assassinated by, allegedly, a 22-year-old who strongly disliked</a> what the conservative activist had to say. The incident is a real-life example of the dangers of conflating speech and violence. It's not acceptable to respond to words you don't like with physical force.</p>\n<h1>There's a Silver Lining\u2014Sort of</h1>\n<p>That said, there is encouraging news. The percentage of college undergrads who say it is at least \"rarely\" acceptable to shout down speakers to prevent them from speaking on campus has dropped to 68 percent from 72 percent last spring. Forty-seven percent of students say it is at least rarely acceptable to block other students from attending a campus speech, down from 54 percent in the spring. And 32 percent find it acceptable to use violence to stop a speech, down from 34 percent.</p>\n<p>But sentiments can be overshadowed by high-profile incidents like assassinations. \"Because of what happened to Charlie Kirk,\" 45 percent of students are \"less comfortable\" expressing their views on controversial political topics during in-class discussions, notes FIRE in its findings. And neither sentiments nor comfort in self-expression have universally shifted.</p>\n<p>\"Moderate and conservative students across the country became significantly less likely to say that shouting down a speaker, blocking entry to an event, or using violence to stop a campus speech are acceptable actions,\" writes FIRE. \"In contrast, liberal students' support for these tactics held steady, or even increased slightly.\"</p>\n<p>As a consequence, 84 percent of Utah Valley students say the country is headed in the wrong direction when it comes to people's ability to freely express their views. At other colleges and universities, 73 percent feel the same way (almost identical to the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/24/most-americans-think-free-speech-is-on-the-decline-survey-finds/\">feeling of the public at large</a>). It should be noted, however, that the news is more positive when students are asked about their own campuses; 53 percent say their own schools are headed in the right direction.</p>\n<p>These students are headed into a world in which many of their peers see little difference, if any, between words and violence. They adhere to this position even after Kirk was murdered for, almost certainly, what he had to say. And they do so in an <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/23/americans-say-politically-motivated-violence-is-increasing-and-they-see-many-reasons-why/\">environment</a> of <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/06/23/political-violence-surges-because-politics-matters-too-much/\">surging political violence</a>.</p>\n<p>Americans worry that the country is becoming less friendly to free expression. But the insistence of too many people that words and violence are the same thing is a big part of the problem.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/survey-91-percent-of-college-students-think-words-can-be-violence-that-could-feed-real-violence/\">Survey: 91 Percent of College Students Think &#039;Words Can Be Violence.&#039; That Could Feed Real Violence.</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

Welcome to my Hallmark movie casting call.</p> <p>My vision is as follows. You: a busy careerist or parent or homemaker. The specifics aren't important, other than your main personality trait, which is \"busy.\" Setting: the holidays, as I've been reliably informed that this is a requirement for Hallmark films. The drama: You are not done shopping for presents, and it is crunch time.</p> <p>Oh no.</p> <p>Enter me, your holiday fairy godmother. (Like any good director, I am casting myself as the hero.) While you're melting down at the prospect of spreading insufficient cheer\u2014your character in ruins, the pressure too much to bear\u2014I appear. Timing is everything. I whisk you away to our supporting cast, a merry band of weirdos, who soothe your sorrows with unorthodox gift suggestions that would have been impossible to find elsewhere. Thanks to the beauties of technology and capitalism, our story need not take place in the quintessential small town. It unfolds instead in the digital sphere, where a massively expanded inventory is available a few clicks away. This isn't your stereotypical Hallmark film. It's going to be a banger.</p> <p>So let us begin.</p> <p>As your holiday guide, I must recommend what is best for every good little man, woman, and child: the gift of freedom, in the form of <em>Reason</em> magazine. Perhaps you know someone who likes freedom. Perhaps you know someone who hates freedom. <em>Reason</em> is perfect for both, whether to elicit a \"yes, queen!\" or a conversion. Buy three-, two-, or one-year subscriptions\u2014all for a little over $1 an issue\u2014<a href=\"https://reason.secure.darwin.cx/J4LGPR1R\">here</a>, before printing out this <a href=\"https://reason.com/the-holiday-gift-of-reason/\">cute little graphic</a> we made and wrapping it in a box. They'll never see it coming.</p> <p>We also have our <a href=\"https://shop.reason.com/\">swag store</a> with selections for babies, toddlers, and adults. Among other things, we sell a <a href=\"https://shop.reason.com/collections/reason-essentials/products/unisex-tie-dye-t-shirt\">tie dye tee</a>, maybe for those who spend time wistfully remembering 1990s fashion. Who can say? We also offer this <a href=\"https://shop.reason.com/collections/reason-essentials/products/neck-gaiter\">neck gaiter</a>, which is slightly reminiscent of the disguises federal immigration officers are donning these days, except it has Reason branding. Please do not get any ideas.</p> <p>After all, we have all the brilliant ideas you could possibly need to triumph over your shopping anxiety. Scroll on for your happy ending. \u2014<strong><em>Billy Binion, reporter</em></strong></p> <h1>For the Sleeping Beauty who struggles with the sleeping part:</h1> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360132 alignleft\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360132 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/kindle-bed-mount-239x300.png\" alt=\"Kindle bed mount\" width=\"239\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Amazon\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kindle-bed-mount-239x300.png 239w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kindle-bed-mount.png 702w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px\" /><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>Cursed with being a two-stage sleeper, I try to focus on the upside: I get to do about an hour of nightly interruption-free reading with my Kindle, usually between 4 and 5 a.m. Eventually, my eyes go soft focus and I drift off for round two. I used to drop the device off the side of the bed, snapping awake to a thud.</p> <p>My <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0F214XDDM/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Kindle bed mount with a page-turning wireless remote</a> has solved that problem and made being awake in the middle of the night less miserable. I'm a stomach sleeper, so I orient my head sideways on the pillow at my preferred angle, with the screen comfortably in view. The remote goes in my opposite hand off to the side, allowing me to turn the pages with an almost imperceptible finger movement. Because my body stays completely inert, it's easier to fall back asleep. And your loved ones do not need to suffer from a tortured sleep schedule to enjoy this gift, as it'll nudge the recipient toward reading great books instead of falling down their nightly social media rabbit hole.</p> <p>My contraption is currently loaded with Vincent Cannato's <em>The Ungovernable City</em>, a 720-page recounting of former New York Mayor John Lindsay's disastrous time in office. The book is newly relevant now that socialist Zohran Mamdani is on the verge of taking office in my poor city. Next, I'll be rereading Thomas Sowell's masterpiece <em>Knowledge and Decisions</em> for a libertarian book club I just formed with my libertarian son, libertarian dad, and not-at-all libertarian mother-in-law (though she does read Reason and is very tolerant of what I push on her).</p> <p>Reading Sowell will be even more delightful than usual with my Kindle bed mount with wireless remote control. The insomniac in your life will treasure it too. \u2014<em><strong>Jim Epstein, executive editor</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0F214XDDM/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Buy the Kindle holder with remote page turner for $28.05</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360134 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360134 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/eight-sleep-pod-300x160.png\" alt=\"Eight Sleep Pod\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" data-credit=\"Eight Sleep\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/eight-sleep-pod-300x160.png 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/eight-sleep-pod-768x409.png 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/eight-sleep-pod.png 868w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>Eight Sleep</figcaption></figure> <p>My best days (and nights) have been in bed. But as any <em>femme d'un certain \u00e2ge</em> will tell you, once your hormones go haywire, nothing will knock you out despite mainlining melatonin and desperately doomscrolling through sleep apps at 3 a.m.</p> <p>Enter the <a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com/product/pod-cover/\">Eight Sleep Pod</a>, a hydropowered bed cover that circulates water of your chosen temperature beneath you, cooling your sweaty self down and sending you into deep dreamland.</p> <p>Regulation is always a touchy subject for libertarians, but when it comes to sleepytime <em>temperature</em> regulation, I'm all about central planning: My bed must be chilly, my Bavarian goose down comforter calibrated for springtime, and the air conditioner set to a balmy 72 degrees Fahrenheit.

Heating, ventilation, and AC are now the standard in American households (<a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/08/25/why-europeans-have-less/\">Europe could never</a>). But in 2025, we have a slew of options to further optimize the air around us.</p> <p>That's why a great humidifier is a perfect Christmas gift this season. As temperatures plunge and the air dries out, a humidifier can help lessen the need for constant moisturizing and hydration to keep those crow's-feet at bay. We have two <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0DLLK5FM3/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Canopy Bedside Humidifiers</a> in our home\u2014they're easy to use, easy to clean in the dishwasher on occasion, and easy to change the filters for (on the rare occasions you need them changed).</p> <p>Monitoring the air can be helpful too, whether you're worried about air pollution from a nearby road or just want to know when you can turn off the vent fan in your kitchen after cooking a stovetop meal. I got the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B097YW5Q72/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Airthings View Plus</a> a year ago to monitor particulate matter, carbon dioxide, radon, and more in my home. There are cheaper versions available from Airthings if you're not as neurotic about air quality as I am (though only the View Plus measures particulate matter, a.k.a. air pollution, and that's what I've found most problematic in my house).</p> <p>Capitalism has given us an almost magical ability to control the weather and air inside our homes.

Players get to cosplay as art dealers with control over world-renowned collections and the hunger to take them to the next level. During each turn, someone puts a painting up for auction and the others compete to buy it. As in real life, the artworks have no intrinsic value beyond what players are willing to pay\u2014and your goal, of course, is to maximize returns. At the end of each round, the collections containing works by the best-selling artists, as determined by the results of the auctions themselves, are rewarded with an extra payout (presumably from the art-loving public that's obsessed with your swanky new acquisitions).</p> <p>Price signals emerge spontaneously, and they become clearer as each new painting is brought to market, particularly when it comes to which artists are hot and which are not. The player controlling the auction is trying to squeeze the biggest payday from the others, while everyone else tries to buy low and sell high. Will Sigrid's melancholy vibes be the next big thing? Or can you drive the market towards Manuel's bold street art? Make the most money, and you win.</p> <p>The game is far from new: Modern Art was designed by Reiner Knizia and first sold in Germany in the early 1990s.

Your appointed Dungeon Master\u2014maybe you, should you accept the challenge\u2014carves out the contours of your tale, while the supporting characters flesh it out as the game proceeds. There are monsters to fight and spells to cast, all while a dragon lies somewhere in wait to terrorize your party. Maybe you'll fight the beast; maybe you'll attempt to negotiate with it; maybe you'll ignore it entirely. The choice is entirely up to you, and the possibilities seem endless.</p> <p>That's the real magic of <em>D&amp;D</em>: the freedom to explore, experiment, and shape your own story.

Because they should, and not just to marinate in the nostalgia that comes with memories of trips to Blockbuster. (RIP.) Thanks to Blu-ray and special 4k Ultra, viewers can get sharper imagery and crisper audio than they would via streaming.</p> <p>For the movie buff in your life, consider giving them an elevated viewing experience in the form of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0FP8C99C1/reasonmagazinea-20/\"><em>Eddington</em></a>. 2025 was the year that Hollywood finally started to reckon with what happened in 2020. And no movie took on that year's combination of anger, paranoia, and can't-make-it-up insanity more directly than this film. Directed with winking glee by cult horror auteur Ari Aster, <em>Eddington</em> reimagines the pandemic and the politics around 2020 first as shotgun-blast satire, and then as something more like a nightmare.</p> <p>When the movie starts, it follows a small-town sheriff in New Mexico who is bothered by the obvious hypocrisy of mask advocates. He's countered by an obnoxious mayoral candidate who argues that the sheriff is being selfish and unreasonable. All around them, society seems to erupt in Black Lives Matter protests and inscrutable ads for crypto and broad-based social disruption, much of it run through internet culture.</p> <p>But what starts as a sharp-witted smirk eventually devolves into something more terrifying, as well-funded antifa soldiers descend on the town and the sheriff finds himself in a murderous, all-out rage on its streets. It's a movie about how, in 2020, everyone went totally crazy. And its manic finale suggests that the only way to really reckon with that year's impact is to relive it as a fever dream of social upheaval, entirely divorced from common sense or basic reality\u2014because in some deep and still-traumatic sense, that's what it was. \u2014<em><strong>Peter Suderman, features editor</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0FP8C99C1/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Buy <em>Eddington</em> on Blu-ray for $29.99</a></p> <h1>For the doomsday practitioner readying for apocalypses big and small:</h1> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360204 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360204 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/jackery-500-gift-300x246.png\" alt=\"Jackery 500\" width=\"300\" height=\"246\" data-credit=\"Amazon\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jackery-500-gift-300x246.png 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jackery-500-gift-768x629.png 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jackery-500-gift.png 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>I'm not ashamed of the fact I have a touch of prepper\u2014grow up dodging ice storm blackouts and tornadoes, all in the twilight of the Cold War, and you, too, will plan ahead for when the grid flickers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B07SM5HBK1/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Jackery 500</a> is a portable battery with 500 watt-hours. For the less paranoid, that's more than enough to charge a laptop and smartphones multiple times. I take mine camping so I can work on scripts in the woods. I imagine it would be very useful on the lam, which will definitely never apply to me. Also, road trips.</p> <p>Technically, it'd be cheaper in terms of watt-hours just to get a lithium battery and hook it up yourself, as our ancestors did. But the beauty of living in an era of insane technological innovation is that you do not have to do that. The Jackery has some major advantages: There is a built-in inverter, so that you can run alternating-current devices (like laptops) off of the direct-current power, notably while on the lam. Also it does not need to be grounded. I don't know how to ground a battery\u2014last time I attempted it, I kept electrocuting my so-called friend Billy.

There's daily stuff that needs cutting, of course. And I'm not above whipping them out at restaurants as a substitute for their dull instruments. Naturally, I've given many as gifts.</p> <p>If your intended recipient needs a tough folding knife that won't elicit tears if lost, I like <a href=\"https://www.bladehq.com/item--Cold-Steel-Crawford-Model-1-Liner--121192\">Cold Steel's Crawford 1</a>. It's reasonably priced and hand-filling with a 3.6-inch 4034 stainless steel blade, a polymer handle, a flipper for opening, and liner lock with a secondary safety to prevent nasty unintended closures. For an upgrade, consider <a href=\"https://knifeworks.com/doug-ritter-rsk-mk1-g2-3-44-tmb-magnacut-blk-org-g-10-handle-knifeworks-exclusive/\">Doug Ritter's RSK Mk1-G2</a>, a folder created in partnership with the reliable and high-quality Hogue. Its 3.4-inch blade is composed of justifiably buzzy Magnacut steel, its handle is made of G10 composite fiberglass, and its lock is Hogue's variant on the out-of-patent and well-regarded Axis crossbar. (If all of that sounds like Chinese to you, that means it's really good.) As the head of <a href=\"https://kniferights.org/\">Knife Rights</a>, buying Ritter's design also helps his efforts against restrictive knife laws.</p> <p>Some knife fanciers insist folding knives are weakened by the pivot. A connoisseur may prefer a fixed-blade knife sized for everyday carry. I gave my son a budget-friendly <a href=\"https://www.bladehq.com/item--Gerber-Stowe-Fixed-Blade-Knife--174457\">Gerber Stowe</a> with a 2.5-inch 440A stainless steel blade and micarta handle scales. It comes with a leather sheath that keeps the overall 6-inch knife relatively discreet on a belt. For an upgrade, consider <a href=\"https://www.bladehq.com/item--ESEE-Knives-Sencillo-Brown-Micarta--183814\">ESEE's Sencillo</a> (\"simple\" in Spanish), a 7.25-inch knife with a 3-inch blade and burlap micarta handle scales. The Magnacut version of the knife appears to be sold out everywhere, but the A2-steel version is plenty sharp and durable. I would know, as I carry it on me. \u2014<em><strong>J.D.

It also just feels really good to hold in your hand. Simple pleasures.</p> <p>What about the teetotalers in your life? No matter\u2014I'd still recommend this product. Crafted from leaded crystal (though there is a standard lead-free variation too), this glass has a nice weight and a gorgeous shine, making it a great addition to any glassware collection. Pour some lemonade and feel bougie.</p> <p>And you don't have to break the bank. The cut leaded crystal version is currently selling for around $33, and the lead-free version is on the market right now for just $8.

Let me introduce you to <a href=\"https://wondergarten.net/\">Wondergarten</a>. What started as an in-home preschool run by Texas couple Lisa and Nathaniel Santa Cruz has become somewhat of an early-childhood empire, featuring a podcast, merchandise, and more. There are seasonally-themed, non-academic books full of songs, stories, and child-friendly art, kitchen, and nature activities\u2014grounded in a curriculum that emphasizes creativity and imagination. There's an online store selling everything from craft supplies to custom playsilks.</p> <p>But the real standout, in my opinion, is the Wondergarten music, composed by Nathaniel Santa Cruz and performed by Kathryn Brunner. It makes a great entry point into the whimsical Wondergarten world for kids and families who won't be doing the whole curriculum. The albums are free to listen to on the Wondergarten website but can also be purchased there in CD format, or as MP3s on iTunes; illustrated songbooks, featuring sheet music and lyrics, are also for sale in physical and digital formats. So it is possible to gift this music from far away, or in an unwrappable form.</p> <p>My two sons\u2014ages 2 and 4\u2014have loved listening to the Wondergarten albums, which are broken down by season and month and feature a cast of characters that includes Mr. Hamilton Squirrel, Mr. Morrison Mole, and several distinct gnomes and fairies, as well as personifications of the natural world (such as Sister Flame and Grandfather Moon). The songs are cute and creative without being cloying, which is likely a relief to parents who are really, really tired of hearing <em>Cocomelon</em>. Some of the musical accompaniment is genuinely lovely.</p> <p>After getting hooked on the albums, we started listening to the Wondergarten podcast, which features enchanting and well-produced tales of the gnomes and other familiar inhabitants of Wondergarten. Not only is my 4-year-old transfixed by these, but they've also inspired a lot of imaginative play on his own.</p> <p>With Wondergarten, the Santa Cruz family has created a fun, immersive, and wonder-filled world that feels like a reprieve from the media and activities typically aimed at children these days. It's engaging without being fast-paced, high-tech, or neon-tinged. It doesn't assume small boys and girls must have totally different interests. It's wholesome without being explicitly religious. There are no superheroes or royalty. It's all about encouraging exploration, imagination, and independence\u2014things that most parents, but perhaps especially libertarian-leaning ones, can appreciate. \u2014<em><strong>Elizabeth Nolan Brown, senior editor</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://wondergarten.net/\">Shop Wondergarten</a></p> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360253 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360253 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-300x300.png\" alt=\"YEABRICKS LED Light for Lego\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Amazon\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-300x300.png 300w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-150x150.png 150w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-768x768.png 768w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-400x400.png 400w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-800x800.png 800w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit-675x675.png 675w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lego-lighting-kit.png 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>Is your home decor populated heavily with LEGO displays?

That's where <a href=\"https://www.komusodesign.com/products/the-classic-shift\">the Shift</a> necklace from Komuso Design comes in.</p> <p>The Shift is inspired by 17th-century monks who used small flutes to steady their breathing and find inner peace. When anxiety hits, the necklace naturally slows your exhale, helping your body relax almost instantly.</p> <p>I've had mine for a while, and it's become one of my favorite little grounding rituals. It's helped me manage stress, fight burnout, sleep more easily, and even ease cravings. As someone who took up vaping to quit smoking cigarettes, I can attest that this thing has calmed my nerves more times than I can count. Who wouldn't want a fashion-forward antidote to anxiety? \u2014<em><strong>Eddie Marshall, junior designer</strong></em></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.komusodesign.com/products/the-classic-shift\">Buy the Shift starting at $79</a></p> <p>Looking for a gift for the chronically online person in your life? Consider getting them what is arguably the foil to a keyboard and warrioring fingers: a set of knitting needles and some yarn. I'll admit that it might sound uncool. But grandma hobbies are undergoing a serious renaissance, and it's deeply rewarding to develop the skills necessary to make your own unique accessories and clothing. (Plus, busy hands can't doomscroll.)</p> <p>The age-old wisdom is that an aspiring knitter should start by making a scarf. A secret: That's a surefire way to bore someone out of the hobby. Instead, I recommend a washcloth as a first project. It's a cheap way to give someone an introduction to knitting, so the risk is low: A few balls of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QHGVGY/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Lily Sugar 'N Cream 100 percent cotton yarn</a> and a pair of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QHDAV8/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Clover Size 7 bamboo knitting needles</a> won't run you more than $25 at your local craft store or online. The project can be completed in just a few evenings, there are countless free patterns and tutorials online, and mistakes basically don't matter. A washcloth with holes or wonky edges still scrubs.</p> <p>And hey, if you're lucky, your giftee might be inspired to make you something special next Christmas. After all, your local yarn store\u2014yes, those exist\u2014says a lot about the true miracle that is international trade. I'm currently knitting a striped sweater using merino wool yarn produced in Italy, stainless steel needles made in China, and a pattern written by a Danish designer. It's incredible that today's crafters can access materials made in dozens of countries, let alone afford them. Besides, with our current <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/08/28/tariffs-will-simply-put-us-all-out-of-business-trumps-trade-war-is-crushing-american-crafters/\">volatile tariff regime</a>, who knows how much these things will cost next Christmas. \u2014<em><strong>Fiona Harrigan, deputy managing editor</strong></em></p> <div></div> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/Lily/page/3054514A-505C-4780-9076-06C3F64DD35E\">Shop Lily Sugar 'N Cream</a></p> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000QHDAV8/reasonmagazinea-20/\">Buy Clover knitting needles for $6.29</a></p> <h1>For the one who insists on carrying an inexplicable number of things:</h1> <figure class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360260 alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8360260 alignleft\" src=\"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/Varusteleka-Tactical-Jeans-1-235x300.png\" alt=\"Varusteleka Tactical Jeans\" width=\"235\" height=\"300\" data-credit=\"Varusteleka\" srcset=\"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Varusteleka-Tactical-Jeans-1-235x300.png 235w, https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Varusteleka-Tactical-Jeans-1.png 648w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" /><figcaption>Varusteleka</figcaption></figure> <p>Last year I recommended <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0851319H1/reasonmagazinea-20/\">LA Police Gear's tactical jeans</a>\u2014a steal at just 45 bucks\u2014as a tasteful alternative to cargo apparel.

They have clothes. They have tools. They have blenders.</p> <p>I can relate. A few Mother's Days ago, as I was struggling to generate gift ideas for my mother dearest, her love language dawned on me: quality time, especially when it comes to her children. So why not give her a mother-daughter trip? Not only was I confident she would appreciate it more than another blender, but it would give me a chance to log some rest and relaxation time, as well. And this time of year, that's sorely needed.</p> <p>Since we're living in a technological golden age, you have a free travel agent. For the last two years, I used <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">ChatGPT</a> to plan a pair of fabulous trips: a hiking trip to Banff National Park in Canada and a jaunt to Peru to see Machu Picchu. For budget-conscious travelers, you don't need to gift a flashy, finance-depleting experience. Just ask your favorite artificial intelligence sidekick to get creative with inexpensive options. Let ChatGPT (or <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">Claude</a>, or whoever!) help you explore the world with your loved ones. You won't regret it.</p> <p>And remember: As you and yours walk through TSA en route to your next adventure, you aren't required to allow them to take a picture of you.

(Understandable.) So instead of inviting another critter into their home, harness the power of effective altruism and spark some animal-related joy with <a href=\"https://www.farmkind.giving/\">FarmKind</a>\u2014a nonprofit that has done its homework to identify the best charities working to end factory farming and reduce animal suffering.</p> <p>You can split your donation among all the charities FarmKind supports or direct it to a specific organization that you think would resonate most with the recipient. FarmKind-supported nonprofits are creating innovative and cruelty-free food options, working with companies to improve their animal welfare standards, and pioneering new and more humane food systems. And, since FarmKind's operating costs are covered by philanthropists, every dollar you give goes straight to the organizations that are directly helping animals. They'll even tell you how many animals your gift helps save.</p> <p>Don't have an animal obsessive in your life? Although that may make me question your social circle a bit, you can apply this gift idea to philanthropic ventures of any kind that would resonate with your loved ones' particular soft spots. Print a one-pager with details on the charity (or charities) you chose, wrap it in a shirt box, and place it under the tree.

It requires no assembly, no batteries, and most importantly, no presumption that I know better than you what will maximize your utility. Hayek warned us about the fatal conceit; I'm merely applying his warning to holiday shopping. Why risk gifting someone a sweater that fits like price controls when I can hand them a medium of exchange and let the market work its magic?</p> <p>But criminally underrated is that money, unlike most presents, doesn't impose future obligations. It won't guilt you into wearing it, reading it, watering it, charging it, or finding a place to display it when you haven't even solved that conundrum with last year's artisanal coaster set. It's the only gift fully compatible with the non-aggression principle: no coercion, no nudging, no passive aggressive \"I thought this was your style.\"</p> <p>The classic counter: \"But cash is so impersonal!\" For a rebuttal, we can look to Milton Friedman, who reminded us that \"there's no such thing as a free lunch.\" Indeed. Which is why money is the perfect gift. \u2014<em><strong>Veronique de Rugy, contributing editor</strong></em></p> <div></div> <p><a class=\"btn btn-info\" style=\"color: #ffffff;\">Can't help you with this one</a></p><p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/the-2025-libertarian-gift-guide-28-great-ideas-for-apocalypse-preppers-boozers-self-improvers-and-more/\">The 2025 Libertarian Gift Guide: 28 Great Ideas for Apocalypse Preppers, Boozers, Self-Improvers\u2014and More</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

During a rally Tuesday evening in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, President Trump reminded both Republicans and Democrats of just how savvy a messenger he can be when energizing his base.

He discussed his efforts to bring higher wage jobs to American workers, not illegal aliens. He dismantled Obamacare, highlighting high costs and the trillions in taxpayer dollars given to insurance companies instead of the American people. President Trump went full MAGA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe energy in the room was electric. The subliminal message was clear: Republicans, take this message and run with it during the 2026 midterm election cycle. President Trump tore apart Obamacare. He is tired of insurance companies lining their pockets with Obamacare subsidies, and stated once again that he wants that money sent directly to the American people.\n\n.@POTUS: \"Under Obamacare, trillions of dollars were given directly to health insurance companies...I want to give billions of dollars directly to the people...I want to give NOTHING to the insurance companies...We want you to go out and buy your own health insurance.\" pic.twitter.com/Yrr3dmZOmF \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump Touts the Economy and Tackles 'Affordability' in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump Shares Incredible Update About National Guardsman Shot in DC Terror Attack\n\nImagine being able to use your own money to purchase health insurance instead of those dollars going straight to the insurance companies? For Republicans in 2026, this is a smart policy that could excite the base in an election cycle where President Trump is not on the ballot. Healthcare across America, in many cases, is unaffordable and frustrating. This is certainly an area where the GOP can make up ground with sound policy ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump has essentially closed our southern border by the sheer power he wields through the executive branch. The administration has now moved to tackle illegal immigration within our borders, in regards to both deportations and American jobs taken by illegal aliens.\n\n.@POTUS: Before I took office, 100% of all net new jobs were going to migrants and illegals. Since I took office, 100% of ALL net job creation is going to AMERICAN CITIZENS \u2014 and now, more Americans are working than any time in the history of our country. pic.twitter.com/7zBoCrPCAE \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nWow. Since President Trump took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American citizens. That is an amazing statistic that every GOP House and Senate member should be touting on the campaign trail. Not for nothing, but President Trump is also clearly tired of immigrants coming to America who do not care to fully assimilate or share our values.\n\n.@POTUS: \"If you don't share our values, contribute to our economy, and assimilate into our society, then we don\u2019t want you in our country \u2014 we don't want you.\" pic.twitter.com/NqBWr1ceZ3 \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump also announced a permanent pause on third-world migration, \"including from hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia, and many other countries.\" This is a very smart and, frankly, important policy. During the recent off-year election cycle, many Americans learned for the first time how many third-world immigrants have infiltrated major American cities. This is a winning message and one the GOP should carry into 2026.\n\nFinally, the deadly drugs have got to stop flowing into this country. President Trump has taken lethal action that is sure to have every drug boat planning to bring drugs to America second-guessing that decision. For some Republicans who support Trump's policy but have struggled to properly communicate the importance to their constituents, the president simplified the issue for the entire party.\n\n\ud83d\udea8POTUS on Venezuelan Drug Boats: \"Think about it\u2014every boat that gets hit, we save 25,000 American lives.\" pic.twitter.com/Kd9mMQBXgJ \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) December 10, 2025\n\nThis is where President Trump is at his best. Instead of litigating the action he has taken on the Venezuelan drug boats, he simply points to the number of American lives his actions are saving. 25,000 American lives is not a small number. For the GOP in 2026, the message from President Trump in Pennsylvania is crystal clear: \"After just 10 months, our border is secure, our spirit is restored, inflation is stopped, wages are up, prices are down...and America is back!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow his lead.\n\nEditor's Note: Help RedState continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration's accomplishments as we continue to usher in the Golden Era of America.

December 10, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to increase System Open Market Account (SOMA) securities holdings to maintain an ample level of reserves through purchases in the secondary market of Treasury bills (or, if needed, of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>These reserve management purchases (RMPs) will be sized to accommodate projected trend growth in the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities as well as seasonal fluctuations, such as those driven by tax payment dates.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Monthly amounts of RMPs will be announced on or around the ninth business day of each month alongside a tentative schedule of purchase operations for the subsequent approximately thirty days. </strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><u><strong>The Desk plans to release the first schedule on December 11, 2025, with a total amount of RMPs of approximately $40 billion in Treasury bills; purchases will start on December 12, 2025. </strong></u></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><u><strong>The Desk anticipates that the pace of RMPs will remain elevated for a few months to offset expected large increases in non-reserve liabilities in April. </strong></u><em><strong>[ZH: and in May Powell is out and Trump replaces him with a dovish surrogate].</strong></em></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After that, the pace of total purchases will likely be significantly reduced in line with expected seasonal patterns in Federal Reserve liabilities. Purchase amounts will be adjusted as appropriate based on the outlook for reserve supply and market conditions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Desk was also directed in October to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency securities into Treasury bills via secondary market purchases. <strong>The monthly schedule of planned purchases will include RMPs as well as these purchases.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Desk plans to distribute the monthly secondary market purchases across two Treasury bill sectors. Purchase amounts in each sector will be determined by sector weights. These sector weights will be based on the 12-month average of the par amount of Treasury bills outstanding in each sector relative to the total amount outstanding across the two sectors as initially measured at the end of September 2025.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><p>For the purists this is \"Reserve Management Purchases\", for the non-purists, QE is back with us.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>SEP PROJECTIONS:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fed Funds</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 3.625% (exp. 3.625%, prev. 3.625%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 3.375% (exp. 3.375%, prev. 3.375%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 3.125% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.125%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 3.125% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.125%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 3.00% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.00%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>GDP Growth</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025:1.7% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.3% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.0% (exp. 1.9%, prev. 1.9%)</li>\n\t<li>2028:1.9% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 1.8% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Unemployment rate</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 4.5% (exp. 4.5%, prev. 4.5%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 4.4% (exp. 4.5%, prev. 4.4%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 4.2% (exp. 4.4%, prev. 4.3%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 4.2% (exp. 4.2%, prev. 4.2%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 4.2% (exp. 4.2%, prev. 4.2%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>PCE Inflation</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 2.9% (exp. 2.9%, prev. 3.0%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.4% (exp. 2.6%, prev. 2.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.1% (exp. 2.1%, prev. 2.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 2.0% (exp. 2.0%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 2.0% (exp. 2.0%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Core PCE Inflation</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 3.0% (exp. 3.0%, prev. 3.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.5% (exp. 2.6%, prev. 2.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.1% (exp. 2.2%, prev. 2.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 2.0% (exp. 2.1%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n</ul><p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"640406f7-0815-4153-b29d-a359b0177fb7\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"199\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, in a difference from the state of play into December 2024's hawkish cut, we note that equity positioning into the Fed looked skewed toward expectations for a benign or mildly hawkish cut that<strong> leaves the high-beta rotation intact,</strong> with the<strong> SPX still contained in a wider trading range</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Implied, realized and vol-of-vol are all back at more normal levels after November\u2019s turbulence, while correlations and the tail-risk indexes sit in the middle or lower end of recent bands.

She survived but remains <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-bethany-magees-recovery\">hospitalized</a>, with years of surgeries ahead of her.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Police arrested 50-year-old Lawrence Reed of Chicago the next morning.

And they listened to Obama recount stories of people he had brought to the ceremony who had gone untreated for various serious medical conditions because they could not afford it, and then suggest that, because of the bill he was about to sign, those stories would be a thing of the past.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think it\u2019s safe to assume that the Obama supporters who were watching that day would never have imagined that, fifteen years later, Congress would be battling over the extension of several temporary \u201cemergency\u201d subsidies that had had to be put in place to keep Obamacare afloat as healthcare and health insurance costs soared to heights that would have been considered unimaginable to anyone living in 2010. </strong></p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/3B2MWEC.jpg?itok=3bZ_nigq\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/3B2MWEC.jpg?itok=3bZ_nigq\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8a832983-0100-48a5-90e8-712e93498149\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"250\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/3B2MWEC.jpg?itok=3bZ_nigq\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>But\u00a0<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5636382-health-care-obamacare-house-senate/\">here we are</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As Congress fights over not whether but\u00a0<em>how</em>\u00a0to extend these covid-era ACA subsidies, it can be tempting to call Obamacare a failure.</strong> I mean, how else would you describe an \u201caffordable care\u201d act that made healthcare and health insurance less affordable while requiring a constant influx of new tax dollars to keep it from falling apart?</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s a reasonable conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>But the problem with it is that it takes the political class at its word and accepts that Obamacare was genuinely meant to make healthcare more affordable and accessible to the American people. It wasn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To understand the true purpose that Obamacare served, you have to first go back and understand why government first intervened in the healthcare market a little over a century ago.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It was not, as the progressive creation myths many of us are taught in school suggest, to protect Americans from maniacal doctors or food and drug companies that were trying to kill them. Nor was it to help Americans afford healthcare\u2014prices back then weren\u2019t anywhere near the absurd levels we see today.</p>\n\n<p>The reason government began intervening in healthcare was because some industry insiders and interest groups recognized that they could achieve and protect a level of market dominance practically unseen up to that point if they stopped merely trying to offer customers more value than their competitors and instead used government power to warp the healthcare industry to their benefit.</p>\n\n<p>That began when a physicians\u2019 interest group\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLtB4Jl1dR0&list=PLALopHfWkFlF8FiKMUYeC_u31CvCxYC4X&index=20&t=2195s\">maneuvered</a>\u00a0its way into setting the accreditation standards for American medical schools. That position of influence allowed the group to ban programs that didn\u2019t align with its specific medical philosophy, leading to the forced closure of nearly half the country\u2019s medical schools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This created an artificial shortage of doctors, which kicked off the affordability crisis that has defined American healthcare ever since.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, the problem was still quite limited in the early days. But as other related industries\u2014especially\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-trump-can-lower-drug-prices-without-price-controls\">pharmaceuticals</a>\u2014began falling prey to the same crony dynamic at the heart of the Progressive Era, healthcare quickly began to grow more expensive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, the health insurance industry followed the lead of healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies and lobbied government officials for rules and regulations that benefited insurance companies\u2019 bottom lines.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That effort culminated in a reworking of the tax code under President Truman. The government made employer-provided health insurance tax-deductible while it continued to tax other forms of employee compensation and other means of paying for care. In other words, the government used the tax code to change how Americans paid for healthcare. It didn\u2019t take long for employer-provided insurance plans to become the dominant arrangement and for health insurance to morph away from actual insurance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shortly after that happened, the government significantly ramped up demand for the artificially-constrained supply of medical care with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, leading to an easily-predictable\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive?d7_alias_migrate=1\">explosion</a>\u00a0in the price of healthcare.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And, as fewer and fewer people could afford healthcare at these higher prices, more government assistance was required, which meant more demand, higher prices, more need for government support, and so on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This was not good for everyday Americans, </strong>but it was excellent for healthcare providers and drug companies whose revenues were ballooning as more and more cash poured into the healthcare system.</p>\n\n<p>And it was great for the health \u201cinsurance\u201d companies. All the taxes on competing means of payment effectively acted as a subsidy, putting the industry in a strong position to benefit from the mounting crisis because, in addition to facilitating most of the country\u2019s healthcare spending, they helped these providers grow far beyond the typical bounds of insurance.</p>\n\n<p>In a free market, insurance serves as a means to trade risk. It works well for accidents and calamities that are hard to predict individually but relatively easy to predict in bulk, like car accidents, house fires, and unexpected family deaths. But with the government incentivizing people to buy healthcare through insurance plans, those plans began to grow to cover easily-predictable occurrences like annual physicals.</p>\n\n<p>So, zooming out, industry leaders and interest groups joined forces with government officials to use government interventions to create a healthcare system designed to move as much money as possible to healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and the insurance industry. That is, and has always been, the main motivation behind the federal government\u2019s healthcare policy.</p>\n\n<p>But, as with any scheme like this, the party cannot last forever. It only works as long as money keeps coming in. For an important service like healthcare, which most people don\u2019t consider optional, the threshold is pretty high. But there is still a point where premiums grow too high, fewer employers or individual buyers are willing to buy insurance, and the flow of money into the healthcare system starts to falter.</p>\n\n<p>According to the government\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hib.html\">own census data</a>, that tipping point was reached in the early 2000s. <strong>For the first time since the scam had really kicked off, the number of people with health insurance began to fall each year. The industry\u2014which had apparently assumed the flow of money would never stop increasing\u2014began to panic. </strong></p>\n\n<p>Something had to be done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And that something was Obamacare.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite all the talk of affordability and access used to sell the bill to the public, the Affordable Care Act is best understood\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Overcharged-Americans-Much-Health-Care/dp/1944424768\">as a ploy</a>\u00a0by the healthcare industry and the government to keep the party going.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Obamacare\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ148/PLAW-111publ148.pdf\">required</a>\u00a0all 50 million uninsured Americans to obtain insurance and greatly expanded what these \u201cinsurance\u201d companies covered. Demand for healthcare shot back up, and the vicious cycle\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/The-Economics-of-ObamaCare/Jasinski/p/book/9781032472317\">started back up again</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As any competent economist was saying\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-daily/socialized-healthcare-vs-laws-economics\">before the bill was even passed</a>, ramping demand back up would not make healthcare more \u201caffordable,\u201d it would only raise prices. And that\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive?d7_alias_migrate=1\">exactly what happened</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, as prices rose higher and health \u201cinsurance\u201d moved further and further away from actual insurance, it\u2019s made the American people even more dependent on the government for healthcare, which is how we\u2019ve arrived at our current situation where extra, \u201ctemporary\u201d subsidies rolled out during an official national emergency need to be made permanent to keep everything going.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you want to take the political establishment at their word, the best you can say is that Obamacare kicked the can down the road and made the healthcare affordability crisis worse in exchange for a bit of temporary relief for some uninsured Americans.</p>\n\n<p>But if you view the ACA within the context of the last century of American healthcare policy, <strong>it reversed the faltering demand for healthcare and health insurance, accelerated the racket</strong> moving as much money as possible into the industry, and quickly became a new political third rail that the \u201copposition\u201d party refuses to even consider rolling back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s hard to view that as anything other than a meaningful success.</strong></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T18:05:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 13:05</span>\n",

For now, there is Romanesque rhetoric but Nero-style fiddling going on.</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the FT also argues \u2018Why the world should worry about stablecoins\u2019, concluding that \u201cDollar-based digital currencies offer benefits for the US, <strong>but Britain and the EU are better off resisting them</strong>.\u201d <strong>Really? How</strong>? Is that also fiddling as things get hotter?</p>\n\n<p>The Politico interview also touched on the \u201cTrump Corollary\u201d to the US Monroe Doctrine, where he refused to rule out boots on the ground in Venezuela, or moves vs Colombia or Mexico. That\u2019s as CNN reports the Trump admin is quietly building plans for what would happen if Maduro were ousted \u2013 as if this is in the passive rather than active sense.</p>\n\n<p>In geoeconomics, Trump\u2019s controversial decision to allow Nvidia to sell H200 AI chips to China is seen by Bloomberg as spurred by Huawei\u2019s AI Gains; the Wall Street Journal states those chips will have to undergo an unusual US security review before being exported to China; and the FT claims China will (again) limit access to them anyway, as it aims for its domestic production. <strong><em>That\u2019s </em>what a push for strategic autonomy looks like \u2013 not lots of grand speeches about strategic autonomy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The EU has announced stricter food import controls to reassure EU farmers and address French conditions for supporting the EU-Mercosur deal: will it therefore replace tariffs with non-tariff barriers? <a href=\"https://public-eur.mkt.dynamics.com/api/orgs/285245b1-7c6f-ef11-a66d-000d3a4b6c6a/r/AU5vxSd6c0qi-noU0GUAAAoAAAA?msdynmkt_target=%7B%22TargetUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmoney%252Fcompanies%252Feu-nations-weigh-tariffs-on-china-following-trumps-lead-on-trade-deficits%252Far-AA1RYH0H%253Focid%253DBingNewsSerp%22%2C%22RedirectOptions%22%3A%7B%225%22%3Anull%2C%221%22%3Anull%2C%222%22%3A%7B%22utm_medium%22%3A%22email%22%2C%22utm_term%22%3A%22N%2FA%22%2C%22utm_source%22%3A%22dynamics-rr%22%2C%22utm_content%22%3A%22Email%20351%22%2C%22utm_campaign%22%3A%22SN%3A%20Email%20351%207a79e1%22%7D%7D%7D&msdynmkt_digest=Pgytm06d96gna%2B4e67kk8%2Fdc8FNjfBmTsV5W9rd6rxQ%3D&msdynmkt_secretVersion=7bb221762d0c46939816d3a5592b1359\">It\u2019s also considering further tariffs on China</a>. Meanwhile, EU Industry Commissioner S\u00e9journ\u00e9 admitted: \"Last month, I was supposed to go to Brazil to discuss a rare earth mine. Three days beforehand we were told that the Americans had come, put money on the table, and bought all production until 2030.\" By contrast, China claims to have pulled off a critical mineral production tech revolution in 10 months, leaving it further ahead. And in the UK, a token vote in favor of rejoining the customs union with the EU passed Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>The FT also reports July\u2019s US-Indonesia trade deal is at risk of collapse, with D.C. believing that Jakarta is reneging on terms of agreement. <strong>Watch this space to see how the US reacts when a country doesn\u2019t stick to a deal.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In political economy, France's National Assembly narrowly approved a contentious 2026 social security budget.

Not coincidentally, the UK\u2019s PM Starmer, a former Human Rights lawyer, urged Europe\u2019s leaders to curb (or can we say, \u2018fiddle with\u2019?) the European Court of Human Rights in order to halt the rise of the far right.</p>\n\n<p>In key data, China\u2019s CPI inflation was unchanged y-o-y at 0.7%, but PPI deflation deepened further to -2.2% from -2.1%. Of course, that shows some economic problems, even if the West would kill for 0.7% CPI. <strong>So do reports that major Chinese EV firms are losing money on every vehicle that they sell. </strong>But when the quid pro quo is global domination of supply chains now close the point of no return for other countries\u2019 established industries <em>such that no future recovery is then possible</em>, <strong>it\u2019s arguably still a tune worth squeezing out of all the instruments of economic statecraft\u2026 even if Neo-liberalism burns.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Against <em>that</em> kind of backdrop, the Fed meeting today is just one little note.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T15:20:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 10:20</span>\n",

Somehow, the sentence I'm about to write is even more dispiriting than the one that precedes it: Kyrgios and Sabalenka spent a half an hour on Tuesday promoting this match on Piers Morgan's show.\n\nThe newsworthy portion of the conversation arrived about halfway through, when Morgan turned to the topic of trans participation in sports. \"Martina Navratilova, a former No. 1 like yourself, says it's wrong for the Women's Tennis Association to allow trans women to compete in its events, do you agree with that?\" Morgan asked. Sabalenka replied:\n\nThat's a tricky question. I have nothing to do against [trans people], but I feel like they still got a huge advantage over the woman, and I think it's just not fair to the woman to basically face biologically a man. It's not fair, the woman been working her whole life to reach her limit, and then she has to face a man, which is biologically much stronger, so for me I don't agree with this kind of stuff in sport.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Kyrgios said that Sabalenka had \"hit the nail on the head.\"\n\nThis is all standard fare that you've heard from anti-trans activists hundreds of times by now, but this particular conversation was made more interesting by where it went next. Immediately after agreeing with Kyrgios and Sabalenka, Morgan brought up an incident from earlier this year when Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostyuk implied that Sabalenka has an advantage over her because of her size and potentially \"higher level of testosterone.\"\n\nHere was an interesting moment. Morgan, totally on accident (he asked this question in order to tee up a punchline built around putting Sabalenka's bikini pictures on screen), had plowed the conversation into a queasy and inconvenient truth that anti-trans agitators refuse to grapple with: In the absence of any actual high-level trans athletes attempting to compete, those who most prominently suffer when trans bans are put into place are cis athletes who do not conform to a particular image of femininity. In other words, if anyone currently on the tour is going to end up being subjected to gross speculation and invasive sex testing under a trans ban, it's players who look like Sabalenka.\n\nNone of this, nor the fact that they had just finished talking about how physical advantages can undermine the competitive fairness of their sport, seemed to enter into Sabalaneka's or Kyrgios's heads as they gave their response about Kostyuk:\n\nSabalenka: All I hear here is just excuses. And it's actually quite funny because she's a strong a girl, she probably has more muscles than I do. She looks fit and strong, and I think that's not the case in all of the matches she lost against top players. Kyrgios: We kind of debunked that. Someone like John Isner or Ivo Karlovi\u0107 was a fair bit bigger than Roger Federer, but that doesn't really\u2014 Morgan: Yeah, you're always going to get physical differences between players, obviously\u2014 Sabalenka: I think that's not the key in sports.\n\nThe most important ingredient in maintaining a commitment to anti-trans bigotry is never stopping to think about anything for more than two seconds.",

    "full_content": "It's the most wonderful time of year, and we at Defector are proud to bring back our series discussing some of the most, uh, available holiday movies.\n\nSabrina Imbler: Thanks so much Kelsey and Alex for trudging through this \u201cfilm\u201d with me.\n\nAlex Sujong Laughlin: I am so excited to be here to talk about one man\u2019s sexual tension with Santa.\n\nKelsey McKinney: Hello. I am here to discuss the queer film My Secret Santa, is this the correct place?\n\nSabrina: You are in the right place! Before we dive into the movie, I have to ask. Have either of you ever cross-dressed to commit workplace fraud?\n\nAlex: I really had to sit for a moment and think about it but I\u2019m gonna lean toward no for now.\n\nKelsey: NOT YET! I\u2019m hoping to in the future.\n\nSabrina: 2026 goals! I did not realize when I chose this film that My Secret Santa is essentially a remake of Mrs. Doubtfire except it\u2019s Santa.\n\nKelsey: It also has shades of She\u2019s the Man/Twelfth Night! All the classics of the cross-dressing for employment genre!\n\nSabrina: My Secret Santa opens with our intrepid hero, Taylor Jacobson, getting fired from her job, Fantine-style, which leaves her in dire financial straits. Not only does she need to pay her overdue rent, she also \"needs\" to pay for presumably a very expensive snowboarding school for her daughter Zoey. This was when the movie first fell apart for me. I thought about that dril tweet where someone is like \u201ccan someone help me budget, my family is dying\u201d and it\u2019s like $200 on groceries, $500 on rent, $5,000 on candles. Here, private snowboarding school is candles.\n\nKelsey: One thing I love about movies of this caliber is that you never know what is going to be important. The opening scene of this movie is her very carefully checking decorated cookies for flaws and pulling out the other ones. It\u2019s implied that she\u2019s pretty good at the cookie job and also that she likes it. But guess what? Cookies are not relevant to this movie at all! We never hear about the cookies again! It was all just a job she could lose.\n\nAlex: As the movie went on I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the very first moment in the movie where she picks a Santa cookie out of the lineup and is like, \u201cHe\u2019s depressed!!\u201d That\u2019s called foreshadowing.\n\nKelsey: Also, that Santa cookie looks identical to all the other ones. It\u2019s also called projection.\n\nSabrina: I got where Taylor was coming from, because it seems no one in this small Christmas town has ever seen a therapist, at least one that was not Santa.\n\nKelsey: Don\u2019t be silly, Sabs. You do not need therapy when you have Christmas Spirit.\n\nSabrina: Soooooo true babe. Luckily Taylor has a plan to make some money. She goes to a used record store and tries to sell her collection of vinyl\u2014she only makes $150, which would probably pay for approximately one hour of elite snowboarding school\u2014where she runs into what we are supposed to believe is an alluring eligible bachelor: local hotel heir Matthew Layne.\n\nAlex: It\u2019s moments like these when I fully grasp the width of the chasm between my opinion of a \u201chot man\u201d and Christmas Movie Hot Man. He is fine. The best part about him I think is that he is a huge fan of Screaming Kittens, which turns out to be ... Taylor\u2019s old band?!\n\nKelsey: At this point, the movie has been on for like 15 minutes and there are already so many things happening: old band, potential love interest, snowboarding school, rent problems, fired from job, and also the approach of Christmas, obviously.\n\nAlex: I have this in my notes: \"'You can\u2019t really be a rock star and a mom at the same time' HELL YEAH.\u201d I think I was excited to have the thesis statement spelled out so quickly. I was hoping for a musical performance at some point and I was not disappointed.\n\nSabrina: Matthew asks Taylor out on the traditional adult Christmas date\u2014drinking hot chocolate while leaving room for Jesus\u2014and she cruelly rebuffs him because she cannot be a rock star and a mom and a girlfriend at the same time, obviously.\n\nAlex: Hot chocolate does not exist in the world except for in Christmas movies, but because of this movie I have been craving hot chocolate constantly and I\u2019ve already had it three times.\n\nKelsey: Now, the movie gives us even more plot! The ski resort where Taylor\u2019s daughter has to go to ski school in order to become an Olympic snowboarder(??) even though she is already 16, is a ski resort that is owned by the love interest\u2019s dad. And his dad is mad at him because he already spent so much money crashing his car into a building in Italy(??). So his dad names him the General Manager of the resort, usurping poor Tia Mowry who was in line for the job.\n\nAlex: THRILLING Tia Mowry appearance! This led me down a rabbit hole to confirm that it appears she and Tamara have reconciled in some way so nobody panic.\n\nSabrina: Oh my god, that\u2019s a real Christmas miracle! Twitches lives!! I was pissed off by how this movie treated Tia\u2019s character. She is the only person in this world who got her job without the influence of nepotism, and she seems to be really good at it. Because of this the movie has decided she is an evil careerist mom and therefore the closest this movie comes to a villain.\n\nTaylor learns from her gay brother (more on that later) that the snowboarding tuition is half-off for Sun Peaks employees, so she goes to the hotel to try and get a job. But Tia informs her that the only job they are hiring for is Santa. Alas, Taylor is too beautiful and too female to play Santa!\n\nAlex: It\u2019s at this point that I\u2019m like ... why are you only considering this right now, seemingly two days before this camp starts? If your daughter is this snowboarding savant and you live in this ski town, would this not have come up sooner?? But these movies are not for airtight storytelling. They are the product of someone putting a bunch of nouns and verbs into a hat and covering their eyes as they draw three.\n\nKelsey: I also just do not believe for a second that being Santa at $2000 a week is going to cover half of a snowboarding camp and your rent backlog. Mountain sports are for rich people! And Taylor cannot even pay her rent or get her daughter a new snowboard. Maybe let\u2019s cool it on the snowboarding camp. Or, we as the audience should be given more context about how good Taylor\u2019s daughter is at snowboarding because the way it\u2019s presented in the movie, it seems like she just thinks it\u2019s cool. And unfortunately only rich kids get to do everything they think is cool!\n\nSabrina: Kelsey I was so confused by that. How has her daughter been snowboarding for so long? Has Taylor just been spending 80 percent of her income on snowboarding? Zoey seemed too well-adjusted to be a pro athlete. But fortunately Taylor\u2019s gay brother has a plan: he and his husband will create an elaborate Santa drag disguise for her. This also made no sense financially. The level of detail of the prosthetic Santa mask, the rich velvet of the costume, all of this money could have simply gone to snowboarding school. Or, frankly, to a financial planner for Taylor, to give her the cold hard truth!\n\nAlex: Just to note that I believe Taylor is 100 percent someone who refers to her brother as \u201cmy gay brother\u201d so that is how I\u2019ll be referring to him. Anyway, somehow her gay brother has all the supplies and technology to make professional-level prosthetics for the face and body.\n\nSabrina: When you\u2019re gay they teach you that in gay school, I think.\n\nKelsey: I did really like the Mission: Impossible sequence where they scanned her head with a 3-D scanner and then printed a new face for her as Santa which the gay brother and gay brother-in-law then painted to look realistic. They filled the Santa belly with lentils. Iconique.\n\nAlex: The mask they make is absolutely terrifying. The final product is \u2026 kind of convincing? Through the screen? But I have a hard time believing it wouldn\u2019t feel uncanny valley up close, so that was in the back of my mind the rest of the movie whenever she was in Santa\u2014or rather, Hugh Mann\u2014costume.\n\nSabrina: The mask clearly works on Hotel Heir Matthew and General Manager Tia, because they hire Taylor as Santa. She tells them her name is Hugh \u2026 Mann. This raised many questions for me. How did she not think ahead to come up with a fake name? What on earth does her W2 look like?\n\nKelsey: What kind of passport did she submit!! The Santa job should be cash under the table anyway, in my opinion.\n\nAlex: Mr. Mann!!! It feels like a drag performance at this point. And the gender excitement just keeps going because then she takes a call in the women\u2019s bathroom thinking it\u2019s empty, but of course a toilet flushes and an old lady comes out. The tone is very Ha ha! It\u2019s a man in the women\u2019s bathroom! Isn\u2019t that silly?!\n\nSabrina: Yeah I refuse to engage with or even imagine this movie\u2019s perspective on trans politics. But the next bathroom Taylor finds herself in is a steamy one. She is led by Chief Elf Jimmy to the men\u2019s locker room to change into her Santa fit, where she runs into a nude Matthew Layne. What proceeds is maybe the most homoerotic scene of the movie\u2019s many homoerotic scenes. Midway through dressing, Matthew asks Taylor-as-Hugh to tie his tie for him. I genuinely thought they were going to bone, or something close to it.\n\nAlex: When Matthew Layne is gazing into Hugh Mann\u2019s eyes and saying he just feels like he can talk to him \u2026 wow, it was a truly romantic moment.\n\nKelsey: To me, it is beautiful that the sexual chemistry between Matthew and Taylor exists even when she is dressed in a giant Santa suit. I love love. What I do not love is that one of the clues the movie plants that Hugh Mann is Taylor is a kind of chapstick that has a unicorn head on the top of it that we are supposed to believe Taylor uses all the time.\n\nSabrina: Honestly I felt like the only times Matthew and Taylor had chemistry is when she was in character as Hugh Mann. Maybe it has to do with the way \u201cstraight\u201d men are able to be intimate in a \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d way in these movies that a heterosexual couple simply cannot. But I was genuinely titillated by the Daddy-Son dynamic between them, and I couldn\u2019t help but fantasize about another Christmas movie where the real Santa finds love in a locker room.\n\nKelsey: No, you\u2019re totally right. There was almost no chemistry when Taylor was dressed as herself. I think part of that is because her character description was mainly \u201cuptight\u201d and \u201cscared.\u201d\n\nAlex: And also when she is Hugh Mann, she is also daddy, which is what Matthew desperately needs.\n\nSabrina: Holy shit. Yes. Yes!!!\n\nKelsey: WOW! Freud! It all makes sense. He just wants to get a drink with his dad and be loved by him.\n\nSabrina: I\u2019m reeling.\n\nAlex: I\u2019m gonna be honest, this is the point in the movie where I wrote \u201cit\u2019s giving mulan\u201d and my notes ended because I was hootin and hollerin at the TV. Speeding through the plot though, Hugh becomes the resort\u2019s Santa and is really bad at it at first because she\u2019s too practical, and then she has a heart to heart with Matthew at a bar.\n\nKelsey: My notes at this point say FLAMING CANDY CANES. Because I was very excited by the drink that is brought out to Matthew and Hugh Mann that has crushed candy canes on the side of it and some kind of floating flammable topper shot. No one drinks these because they light Hugh Mann\u2019s beard on fire, but I liked seeing them.\n\nSabrina: After Taylor tries to give a pep talk to her daughter (while dressed as Santa), Zoey tells Santa that all she wants for Christmas is for her mom to get a boyfriend. This changes Taylor\u2019s whole approach to being Santa from being uptight and practical to becoming a kind of therapist to the many children who wish for something less material than presents.\n\nKelsey: More good evidence in my opinion that we should not be risking our life\u2019s savings on snowboarding school!! Your Christmas wish is for your mom to have a boyfriend?\n\nAlex: Also, just a small note on the topic of Taylor\u2019s financial literacy: I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s wearing a Canada Goose coat in one scene?!? Those are like $1000???\n\nSabrina: And I feel like that\u2019s still less expensive than this Santa drag getup! Which, by the way, has already been repaired twice after the fire incident, and another incident when an overzealous child bursts Hugh Mann\u2019s belly leading him to gush lentils like a burst artery. This was a fun bit of body horror for me, imagining a kind of man who is made of lentils. But soon we come to what was, for me, the absolute worst part of the movie. A young girl who stutters comes up to Hugh Mann and says her Christmas wish is to not stutter anymore, and then Hugh Mann tells her that stuttering can be fixed with the power of song, and then they all sing \u201cJingle Bells\u201d together (in my opinion the worst Christmas song!) and the girl doesn\u2019t stutter and her mom tells her she\u2019s proud of her and the moment goes viral on the internet and this is all used as evidence that Matthew has now become good at general managing a hotel.\n\nKelsey: I hated this part, to be honest. Although, it did lead me to googling whether or not singing helps stuttering and apparently it does help. Also the website it goes viral on is called \"HAPPENED.\" We see it on a computer screen.\n\nSabrina: That reminds me of when Tia Mowry is doing investigative journalism on Hugh Mann and looks him up on a search engine called \u201cLook Path\u201d and then again on a website called \u201cJobization.\u201d I had fun imagining what terrible tech billionaires ruled over this world of Christmas.\n\nAlex: I could tell we were on the path toward a zany party scene where both Taylor and Hugh are invited and expected to make appearances, and I was impatient to get there.\n\nSabrina: The party where Hugh and Taylor both have to be there is a good bit of fun. She has to run back and forth to the bathroom to change in and out of Santa drag with the help of her gay brother, who is also really hungry for some reason? Why didn\u2019t he eat before this?\n\nKelsey: I was dying at the hunger subplot. Why are you so hungry? Why do you want your sister-in-law who is clearly in crisis to bring you weird catered food from upstairs! Just wait!\n\nAlex: And this is where we get an explicitly implied gay sex scene in the bathroom because Matthew walks in and hears Taylor and gay brother grunting and banging on walls as they tried to get her fat suit on, and then Hugh walks out and it\u2019s like\u2026\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nSabrina: I was pleasantly surprised by Matthew\u2019s reaction to hearing what could only have been gay sex in the bathroom of his hotel lobby. He reacted like an ally! Or even a man who might be interested in trying some of that himself!\n\nAlex: I have to imagine that Matthew was at least a little bit curious!!! Given everything he\u2019s going through!!!\n\nKelsey: And also when it was revealed to be his man-crush Hugh Mann who was in there making these sounds, he was very professional and kind. Matthew is an ally.\n\nAlex: By this point, Tia has figured out a connection between Hugh and Taylor because she realized that Hugh had filled out his paperwork with her Social Security number, and she\u2019s like \u201ccheckmate to my nemesis.\u201d She wants to be the general manager of the resort and she thinks exposing Hugh will make Matthew look bad and secure the promotion for her. Which is incredibly misguided because when does sabotaging someone over an opportunity you were already passed over for work out in your favor? Also, these people think and talk about general managers so much more than anyone, ever.\n\nSabrina: After Tia accuses Taylor in front of the party, Taylor is feeling cornered. I thought she was going to do a Mission: Impossible unmasking, ripping off her Santa face and spraying the room with lentils, but then a hotel employee runs in asking for Taylor, because her daughter Zoey had a snowboarding accident. This stressed me out so much because presumably Sun Peaks is not offering their seasonal employee Hugh Mann health insurance??\n\nKelsey: God I wish the lentils had made a comeback!\n\nAlex: I do not ski for many reasons but chief among them is the risk of catastrophic injury, and when Zoey is on a stretcher with her neck in a neck brace I thought it was going to be so much worse than what turned out to be a sprained arm?\n\nSabrina: Yeah they really bait-and-switched us! When I saw the neck brace I was prepared for a worst-case scenario, and then like two scenes later she just is wearing a sling.\n\nKelsey: Insane that there was no concern about health insurance when she took a part-time job to pay for snowboarding school! I did really enjoy the scene though where Taylor forgets she is dressed as Santa and is comforting her injured daughter who is \u2026 so confused about why Santa is there.\n\nSabrina: That\u2019s finally when Hugh Mann unmasks to reveal himself as Taylor, leaving everyone shocked, but Matthew overall seemed pretty chill about it, which I appreciated. Taylor was like, I can explain! And Matthew was like, Your daughter is in a neck brace, which is more important than our situationship. I was a little confused why everyone was so mad about Taylor being Santa. Obviously it\u2019s not a good idea to have hired someone to work with children without doing a background check first, and employment fraud is probably bad, probably? But also I feel like there must be gender discrimination in the Santa industry, and would Taylor have been hired if she had been honest about being a woman?\n\nAlex: Yeah, if this happened in real life, in no universe does the heat come down on the beloved resort Santa. This is a local newspaper investigation into the hiring practices of the resort and how there are no background checks done.\n\nSabrina: This is where I have to be honest and say that the first evening I sat down and tried to watch this movie, I paused after 15 minutes to watch my favorite Christmas-adjacent movie of all time, Spotlight. It was a really good decision. And I returned to My Secret Santa when I had a more open, patient heart.\n\nUltimately Taylor and Matthew reconcile at some kind of unveiling with the same \u201cbig crowd\u201d of 20 extras who appear in every single crowd shot. She decides to walk on stage as Matthew is announcing something and then apologizes, and then Matthew finally admits that he was feeling sexual feelings toward Santa. I wish they had been able to have this conversation in private so that Taylor, as the sister of a gay brother, might have been able to shepherd him toward an understanding of his queerness. But no, they had to reconcile in front of a crowd so that everyone could clap when they kissed and then sing a \u201cpunk\u201d rendition of \"Run Rudolph Run\" that I simply do not believe was punk.\n\nKelsey: As a sister of a gay brother, you would think she would try harder! I agree!\n\nAlex: He does admit he misses Hugh, which makes me believe that there\u2019s room for this relationship to evolve with time.\n\nSabrina: That\u2019s right, Taylor, it\u2019s never too late to transition!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe movie closes with everyone at a Christmas party together smiling laughing whatever. Boring! Let Matthew kiss Hugh on his wizened old lips! Do you feel like you learned any lessons from this movie?\n\nAlex: I learned that it is impossible to be a present parent and also be successful at your career so you gotta choose one. Classic!\n\nKelsey: A lesson I learned is to never fill your fake belly with only lentils if it is not double lined. You need the lentils to be secure. What lessons did you learn?\n\nSabrina: I learned the lesson of Mamma Mia, which is that you should always tell your daughter about the band you were in when you were younger because it fosters a genuine and lasting connection between the two of you that can also help transfer intergenerational wisdom about financial planning (in this case from Zoey to Taylor). And I learned to never do winter sports without health insurance.",

Or is this just college football fans, and mostly those from the lower right quadrant of the nation, shrieking in glee at said diaper and its owner?\n\nWe're not exactly sure, to be honest, although it says something about the tone of it all that the metaphorical diaper is a constant. Despite its ongoing consolidation into sprawling gigaconferences, college football has never been a more regional sport than it is now, and a large part of the nation that's still invested in the whole Ponzi scheme likes the fact that everyone involved is pantloading in a frantically public way. As big a deal as Notre Dame football is\u2014and it is a big deal, if not quite as big a deal as it believes itself to be\u2014this is more about the chance to giggle and gawk at an embarrassing public spectacle than it is anything to do with the game itself.\n\nBut here we are anyway, on Day 4 of a two-day story, with Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark chastising Bevacqua for complaining about ACC commissioner Jim Phillips' inertia re: the ACC social media team's frantic promotion for the playoff candidacy of full member Miami instead of part member Notre Dame. That's a lot to follow, a proper pigpile of socially arrested suits moaning and groaning about each other. They are upset because their entire system is a Jenga tower wrapped in money and coated in maple syrup; they are complaining because that's more or less their raison d'etre.\n\nNotre Dame has always been an easy target for such fans and opponents because of the advantages it has blackjacked into being. Those include being an independent in the program's most lucrative sport and a conference member in all the others; having its own network; and the recent discovery that they can be grandfathered into the 2026 playoff simply by being ranked in the top 12 by the nitwit-powered playoff committee. Notre Dame is entitled because they are Notre Dame, but it is more salient in this case that the system has re-entitled them. As a result, Notre Dame when wronged is particularly squeally, and those who don't like them for those privileges (read: the rest of College Football America) will naturally be inclined to soak their feet in the bucket of Notre Dame's tears.\n\nBut if it were just that, we could all move on to some other seasonal gripe\u2014the fact that inflatable front yard Santas are not only a thing but a thing that costs $200, maybe. It isn't just that, though. College football is no longer about either college or football. It's certainly not about the players, who used to be student-athletes but now are working their way toward the drinking-age hell of being employees. College football is about itself, and more specifically about the act of consuming itself\u2014about being shouty about something or someone. We suspect that Bevacqua knows this in his way, just as the committee knew it in their context, and Lane Kiffin knew about it in his uniquely hyper-solipsistic way, and LSU knew it when it fired Brian Kelly, then unfired him so they could avoid paying him, then lost their interest in unfiring him when they found out they'd have to pay him anyway and fired him again. You can see this knowledge, which is cynical and sure and absolutely ice cold, in the way that coaches were being fired weekly for Snickers and giggles all season, and in USC and Michigan complaining that Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti is seeking out hedge fund operators to fuel college sports. Everyone knows their respective advantage and what they can get away with, and everyone is pressing their luck.\n\nIt's all adult-on-adult behavior, and the one thing youth culture has always gotten right is how utterly contemptible adults are when left to their own reflections. Commissioners? Athletic directors? Coaches? Hedge funds? How much closer to the bottom of the latrine are we this year than last?\n\nWhatever that distance, this is what college football wants to be now, and so we must presume what it will continue to be. People even hate the comparatively charming presences of Tulane and James Madison in the playoff as the business' last offering to the 100-some-odd schools left out of the SEC/Big Ten appropriation of the levers of power. Those people will likely be proven right, if annoying, when Tulane gets boatraced (again) by the de-Kiffinized Ole Miss and JMU gets pounded by Oregon. Those adults will complain about the playoff format for five days while the Tulane and JMU coaches flit off to their next jobs, and then everyone will get back to the bidness of bidness.\n\nWith all that as the backdrop, Notre Dame re-galvanizing the industry's Pavlovian hate against itself may actually be brilliant if self-parodic theatre, a reminder that, even in this churning mosh pit of soul-deficient moneygrubbers, there is one thing they can all agree upon. We prefer to think, then, that Pete Bevacqua saw the business tearing itself apart and imposed the power incumbent in his office as Chief Petty Officer Of The U.S.S. Fighting Irish to remind everyone of the one thing they can all agree upon\u2014hating Notre Dame for being so relentlessly, persistently and shamelessly Notre Dame. Bevacqua's sacrifice should be hailed as what it is, a brave act of falling on the grenade to save the rest of the platoon. The only real quibble we have is why anyone would bother to take one for this platoon, even or especially when it all just feels like friendly fire.",

Mayhap, I mused, I was not destined for love in this life, at least not the romantic kind, that full-body luminescence conjured when two hearts meet, mingle, and meld. O, the ecstasy of amplexus, are we fated never to touch?\n\nEnough! I can spare no more space in my heart for a vile temptress. Having escaped with everything but my dignity intact, I literally hopped with my proverbial tail betwixt my legs. I hankered for the comfort of home, that old familiar plastic cube in the laboratory, and knew thither I must go. These clinical strictures, which once felt suffocating, now offered me a sense of comfort, how wrapping yourself in a blanket is sometimes the closest you can come to being held.\n\nAnd so my days became humdrum once more. I splayed my webbed toes against the plastic and watched the others do what we frogs are known to do: sit, stare, and haphazardly hop. I felt no love for the beings whose enormous hands dropped mealworms into my cube, but at least the terms of our arrangement were clear and transactional. We each knew what we were getting from each other. I would not awake with horror to find my legs disappeared in their toothy and cavernous jaws.\n\nI became contented with this banal purgatory, the days multiplying like minced planaria. So when a detestable invertebrate was once again dropped without warning into my plastic box, when I heard its loathsome little wings battering the acrylic walls, I turned around without hesitation and opened my mouth to swallow the minibeast. After weeks of mealworms, I was ready for flavor and prepared for significant bodily harm. O wretched ambrosial bug, come into my mouth!\n\nShinji Sugiura\n\nWhen I opened my eyes to see my meal, horror coursed through the cold blood of my veins. I am no stranger to pain. I had survived the barbed penes of the mason wasp and the pestilential nectar of the bombardier beetle. But now I faced a nemesis I feared I could not vanquish. Time wavered as I realized that I now looked upon the northern giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia. Had I not been so hungry, I would have bowed my head in reverence to such a creature. This is the beast some call the murder hornet.\n\nWhat a predicament I have inflicted upon myself! Shinji Sugiura\n\nVerily, good reader, I had heard the horror stories. How its stinger slices through the dense barrier of a beekeeping suit as if it were nothing more than silk. How it slays four score bees a minute, decapitating each worker head by puny head. How a single prick of its venom can kill a mouse. How might the life of a mouse measure up to that of of a frog? The odds, I reasoned, were not in my favor. I thought I had stared Death in his wizened face before, felt his stale breath waft over my mortal soul, but I know now I had never been in any real danger. The mason wasp and bombardier beetle were mere hurdles, a way to test my thirst for the spice of life. But this, it dawned on me, would be my final test. Was this lonely frog ready to die?\n\nO Death, am I ready for your sweet embrace? Shinji Sugiura\n\nOf course I contemplated spitting out the hornet, wrenching it from my lips with the suctioned pads of my forelimbs. Yet my mouth rudely ignored my mind; my jaws clamped together as the creature thrashed in my throat. I thought of many things in these precious seconds that preceded the pain. I thought of my almost-love, my almost-killer. I thought of my youth in Honshu, whose green fields I remember only in dreams. Was it still my homeland, or had my home become this plastic cube? Had the fluorescent overhead lighting become my new sun, and these large-fingered scientists my pantheon of gods? 'Twould not be so bad to die like this, I reasoned, among the closest thing a frog has got to family. No need to mend a broken heart if it stops beating entirely. And so I waited, hornet in my jaws, thinking of my father\u2014had I ever met him, and did he look like me?\u2014and felt the Dreaded Puncture of my supper's stinger slicing through my flesh. Farewell, brutish world!\n\nCome, Reaper, I am ready for your embrace! Shinji Sugiura\n\nI waited, and waited, and waited, and as I waited this dastardly hornet stung me once more on my lip, and then my throat and face, and finally, my eyeball. This is when I began pleading with Death to come more expeditiously. Come Charon, here is my coin! Let me hop with the shades! Through my stung eye, I looked beyond the walls of my box to see if any of my fellow frogs bore witness to my expiration. But none spared me a second glance. My comrades were each in their boxes, munching on hornets of their own, and looking invariably unperturbed. What was the meaning of this? Were we not all put on Earth to die, put specifically in this laboratory to be murdered by way of hornet?\n\nAnd then I swallowed the hornet and felt fine. A cold sheen seeped from my mucus membrane as I realized that I was, against every expectation, going to live. (This also surprised the scientists.)\n\nFrog who is \"going to be okay.\" Shinji Sugiura\n\nIn that moment I understood the devil with which I had danced. I had almost given up the most precious gift a frog can have, because of what, exactly? Some failed romance? I was a fool to search for happiness in others before I could first find happiness in myself.\n\nI may be a frog alone in the world, but this is not such a tragedy. I have my two strong hindlimbs for hopping, my two dexterous forelimbs for pushing giant, wriggling hornets down my gullet. I have eyes that can see despite being repeatedly stung. I have a mind and a soul, one no more or less significant than any of the other beings around me in this lab. I have a story, which I am not ready to end. I am not ready to croak. Bring it on, life, give me more! Give me more taste, more experiences. Give me the moon and the stars! Give me more joy, more love, even more heartache, I am ready for it all! Whatever the webbed fingers of the heavens may throw at me next, I will open my mouth wide to guzzle the rapture and the pain, to be changed by what will change me. You know what I'm getting at. Another hornet, good sir!",

But some of us have more of what I might call a medieval peasant mindset toward a sport that inherently features a whole lot of randomness, and it is becoming clearer with each victory that the Ducks are blessed by some power greater than \"being good at hockey.\" Call it what you like\u2014mojo, juju, puck luck, duck luck, the favor of the Canaanite goddess Astarte\u2014the Ducks have it.\n\nConsider Tuesday's 4-3 shootout victory in Pittsburgh, a showdown of semi-aquatic birds. The Penguins took 47 shots to Anaheim's 28, had five power plays to the Ducks' one, enjoyed 80 percent of the game's high-danger scoring chances, and generally broke the Deserve To Win O'Meter. Yet it was the Ducks who came away with two points\u2014duck, duck, deuce?\u2014for they enjoy the inscrutable blessings of fate and physics.\n\nIt took a pair of miracles to get there, but that's simply the way the puck bounces when things are going good. The first came at the end of regulation\u2014the very, very end. 19:59.9 of the third period, to be precise, when the Ducks, down a goal, down a man but with their goalie pulled, skated in on a Pens defense that looked fairly prepared for the desperation attempt. But rookie Beckett Sennecke was allowed a shocking amount of room to maneuver on net (play the man, not the puck!) and attempted a short pass across the goalmouth that, had things gone according to Sennecke's plan, would have seen time expire. \"I wasn\u2019t really keeping track of the time,\u201d Sennecke admitted.\n\nBut the pass bounced off the hand of a sprawled Erik Karlsson and in, with 0.1 showing on the clock.\n\n\"It hit my hand and went in. There was no question about it,\u201d Karlsson said. \u201cHow it came to be that way, I don't really know.\" Yes! Join me in freeing yourself from the shackles of causality! This is the NHL in December, where nothing makes sense and nothing really matters. The Pens are an inexplicable 1-7 on games that make it to overtime? Sure, why not. The Ducks are 19-10-1, and have won three straight despite being down to their third and fourth goaltenders? Tell another one.\n\nVille Husso, said third-string netminder, is on a very Ducklike heater, in that he's winning game after game despite not playing a very good goal. He's allowed three or more goals in four of six starts since stepping in for the injured Lukas Dostal and Petr Mrazek, and he's 5-1 in those games. A representative bit of Husso magic came in overtime, when Sidney Crosby along the goal line pushed a lovely pass out to Tommy Novak in the opposite circle for the one-timer. An off-balance Husso reached out with his stick ... and didn't get anywhere near it.\n\nIt's tough to see, even on replays, but Novak's shot hit the post and rode up Husso's stick, and he deposited it in an only slightly less dangerous part of the crease, until it was fortuitously cleared away. I'm not sure Husso really did anything here, let alone earned the \"save of the year\" caption, but all that ultimately matters is straightforward enough to be described to a caveman, and puck no go in.\n\nLeo Carlsson's first-round shootout goal stood up, as Husso added three more stops to go with his 44 saves.\n\nHusso has likened the Ducks' hot start\u2014and we're past a third of the way through the season, so this is more than a fluke\u2014to the Blues' Stanley Cup run he enjoyed from the bench in 2019. \"I feel like there\u2019s a lot of similar stuff happening here. The atmosphere and everything. The rink is buzzing. Fans are excited. Everything is just like clicking.\" Do not underestimate the power of buzzing and clicking. Something weird and fun is happening here.\n\n",

    "full_content": "American workers saw their inflation-adjusted pay increase for the fifth consecutive quarter, providing continued relief on household budgets even as the pace of compensation growth moderates from pandemic-era peaks.\n\nTotal compensation for private-sector workers rose 3.5 percent in the 12 months ending in September, while inflation increased roughly 3 percent over the same period, according to the Employment Cost Index released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That left workers with real purchasing power gains of 0.6 percent for wages and salaries and 0.5 percent for total compensation including benefits.\n\nThe quarterly data showed wages and salaries increased 0.8 percent in the three months ending September 30, matching the pace of total compensation growth. Benefits, which include health insurance and retirement contributions, also rose 0.8 percent during the quarter.\n\nThe 3.5 percent annual increase represents a significant moderation from peaks above five percent in late 2022. However, workers are in a stronger position now than during that earlier period, when inflation was running at 6 percent or higher, eroding purchasing power despite the faster nominal wage growth. The current pace marks the slowest compensation growth since early 2021, but it\u2019s also one of the few periods since the pandemic where paychecks have consistently outpaced price increases.\n\nThe Employment Cost Index, favored by Federal Reserve policymakers because it controls for shifts in the types of jobs people hold, provides a clearer picture of pure wage pressure and labor market health than other measures. Unlike average hourly earnings data, the ECI isolates how much employers are raising pay for the same positions rather than reflecting changes in employment mix.\n\nRegional Variation in Pay Gains\n\nThe data revealed substantial geographic differences in compensation growth. Workers in the Miami metro area saw 12-month pay increases of 5.7 percent, while those in Seattle received 4.7 percent more. By contrast, the Washington, D.C. area recorded just 2.2 percent compensation growth, the slowest among major metropolitan regions tracked.\n\nManufacturing workers saw wages rise 3.6 percent annually, while education and health services workers experienced 3.9 percent growth. Union workers continued to see faster pay gains than non-union employees, with increases of 4.5 percent versus 3.5 percent respectively.\n\nThe report\u2019s release was delayed more than five weeks due to the federal government shutdown that lasted from late September through mid-November. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that data collection was interrupted before the shutdown began, and survey response rates decreased for the September quarter.\n\n\u201cAfter funding had been restored, any data self-reported by establishments during the shutdown were reviewed and included; however, survey response rates decreased in September,\u201d the agency stated in the report.\n\nThe next Employment Cost Index, originally scheduled for December, has been rescheduled to February 10, 2026.\n\nImplications for Consumers and Monetary Policy\n\nThe continued real wage gains suggest American households have maintained some ability to absorb price increases without cutting back on spending. Consumer expenditures have remained resilient through 2025 despite elevated prices for housing, food, and other essentials compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, the moderating pace of compensation growth alongside positive but slower inflation readings may support continued interest rate cuts as policymakers seek to balance employment and price stability objectives.\n\nThe moderation in wage growth reflects a jobs market that has cooled considerably from the red-hot conditions of 2021-2022, when employers faced severe worker shortages. Hiring has slowed and job openings have declined, reducing workers\u2019 leverage in salary negotiations even as layoffs remain relatively low by historical standards.\n\nStill, the fact that paychecks continue growing faster than prices means the average worker can buy slightly more with their paycheck than they could a year ago, providing at least some cushion against ongoing affordability concerns that have dominated household financial anxiety since inflation surged in 2021.",

I moved to a neighborhood ... where they had parties every Saturday, and I started to drink with them. Before I knew it, I was hung up on this stuff. I couldn\u2019t believe it.

It also lets him pursue his love of dancing.</p><p>\"I still try to hit the gym three times a week,\" he explained. \"I don\u2019t know why this is something I still want to do, but it is. I\u2019m not a \u2018wake up and go back to bed\u2019 type just yet, unless it\u2019s cold and rainy. If I miss too many gym days, I really can feel it \u2014 a stiffness creeping in here and there. If I let that set in, well, God help me.\"</p><p>\"At the gym,\u00a0I usually do a circuit, going from one machine to the next without a break, in a circle,\" he said. \"I start with the sit-up machine. [My wife] Arlene says I could do 500, but that might be exaggerating. Then I do all the leg machines religiously because my legs are two of my most cherished possessions. And then the upper body.\"</p><p>\"The secret ingredient is the music,\" he continued. \"Most of my humming and singing really happens when I\u2019m going from one machine to another.

Mark Koran, who represents Minnesota\u2019s District 28 in eastern Minnesota, told Fox News Digital the \"scale and scope\" of the fraud is \"almost incomprehensible\" and that the buck stops with Walz.\u00a0</p><p><strong>\"</strong>You have to look at who's been solely in charge of that process, which has been Governor Walz,\" Koran said. \"The executive body controls every agency.

And I think they're actually both.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/expert-reveals-key-factor-led-massive-minnesota-fraud-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>EXPERT REVEALS KEY FACTOR THAT LED TO MASSIVE MINNESOTA FRAUD SCHEME</strong></a></p><p>In addition to facing overall blame due to the governor overseeing all the agencies involved in the fraud, Walz has faced criticism for his specific response to the Feeding Our Future scandal, which involves a\u00a0scheme that prosecutors say exploited a federally funded children\u2019s nutrition program administered by the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, siphoning money meant to provide meals to low-income kids.\u00a0</p><p>It now stands as the nation's largest COVID-19 fraud case.</p><p><strong>\"</strong>Minnesota has an epidemic of fraud, as the rest of the nation is learning,\" GOP state Sen. Michael Kreun told Fox News Digital. \"We've known here in Minnesota for quite some time that we've had a massive fraud problem, and it's turning out that probably Minnesota is the epicenter of fraud in the United States right now, which is really unfortunate. And you know, we've been working on a lot of anti-fraud measures, particularly over the last year. Unfortunately, Governor Walz has been fighting us in those efforts.\"</p><p>Kreun, who represents the 32nd District in Anoka County north of Minneapolis, said that while there are many culprits, Walz \"first and foremost has allowed this fraud to happen.\"</p><p><strong>\"</strong>Attorney General Keith Ellison has also been very negligent in his handling of the fraud,\" Kreun explained. \"Seems like most of our social services programs here in Minnesota were basically set up under kind of the honor system, and there have not been a lot of guardrails. And once the fraudsters realized how to exploit these programs, the administration, the Walz administration, hasn't done really anything to put safeguards in place to prevent the fraud that was developing over a number of years.\"</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Republican</a> legislators plan to take action during the next legislative session to implement more oversight of the troubled agencies, Koran told Fox News Digital that many don\u2019t understand the \"challenge\" they face is that the legislature \"doesn\u2019t have any oversight in the execution and operations of these agencies.\"</p><p><strong>\"</strong>The governor has had sole responsibility since the day he's arrived,\" Koran said. \"He entered into a fraudulent environment. He's enhanced the fraudulent environment, and he's not done a single thing to stop that fraud.\"</p><p>A spokesperson from Walz's office pushed back on the lawmakers, saying in a statement to Fox News Digital that Walz \"views addressing fraud as a top priority.\"</p><p>\"Over the last three years, he has made systematic changes to state government,\" the spokesperson said. \"Detecting fraud is resource intensive and time-consuming \u2014 especially when it comes to the federal Medicaid programs that have a complex interplay between federal, state, and county governments and private insurance companies. It is an issue that many states, both red and blue, have faced.\"</p><p>\"That is why we have created additional checks and balances throughout state government. We have hired investigators, auditors, and law enforcement. The Governor has brought in an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs at the Department of Human Services (DHS) and created a specialized fraud-fighting law enforcement unit at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He has installed new leadership at DHS with a single-minded focus on stopping fraudulent payments. Many of the changes have not been flashy or headline-grabbing, but rather just the hard work of building stronger safeguards throughout state government.\"</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Amada Macias contributed to this report.</i></p>",

    "content": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/justice-department\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Justice Department</a> filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against Minneapolis Public Schools (Board), Special School District No. 1, the Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) and MPS Superintendent Lisa Sayles-Adams over alleged racial discrimination against teachers.</p><p>The DOJ claims that since July 1, 2021, the defendants have worked with a teacher's union to provide \"<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">black teachers, teachers of color</a>, and 'underrepresented' teachers preferential treatment in employment decisions.\" Meaning that teachers who were deemed to be members of \"underrepresented groups\" were skipped for things such as reassignments and even layoffs, according to the DOJ.</p><p>\"Discrimination is unacceptable in all forms, especially when it comes to hiring decisions. Our public education system in Minnesota and across the country must be a bastion of merit and equal opportunity \u2014 not DEI,\" Attorney General <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pam-bondi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pam Bondi</a> said in a DOJ statement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-wisconsin-university-dei-staffer-wins-265k-settlement-after-alleging-discrimination-being-white\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>EX-WISCONSIN UNIVERSITY DEI STAFFER WINS $265K SETTLEMENT AFTER ALLEGING DISCRIMINATION FOR BEING WHITE</strong></a></p><p>The collective bargaining agreement also includes the defendants' relationship with a third-party group known as \"Black Men Teach.\" Fellows of \"Black Men Teach\" were allotted extra paid training days and were exempt from \"normal layoff policies, according to the DOJ. The department pointed out that, as the name implies, only black men are allowed to become \"Black Men Teach\" fellows.</p><p>\"While Defendants claim that these provisions are to stop discrimination, they require Defendants to blatantly discriminate against teachers based on their race, color, sex and national origin,\" the DOJ complaint reads.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-appointed-judge-strikes-down-anti-dei-measures-from-education-department\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGE STRIKES DOWN ANTI-DEI MEASURES FROM EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</strong></a></p><p>The department also claims that MPS documents show the district is aiming to increase the number of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) staff by 40%.

Researchers used the cultured cells to print about 300 transparent implants with Precise Bio's regenerative platform.\u00a0</p><p>Their system builds a layered structure that looks and behaves like a natural cornea. It is designed to provide clarity, strength and long-term function.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-tiny-retinal-implant-helping-people-regain-sight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT</strong></a></p><p>Since donor shortages prevent millions from receiving sight-saving care each year, this approach could transform access. Many patients in developed countries wait only a few days for a transplant, while others wait years due to low tissue availability. A single donor cornea that can create hundreds of implants changes that equation.\u00a0</p><p>Professor Michael Mimouni, director of the Cornea Unit in the Department of Ophthalmology at Rambam Eye Institute, led the surgical team. He described the moment as unforgettable because the lab-grown implant restored sight to a real patient for the first time.</p><p>He says, \"What this platform shows and proves is that in the lab, you can expand human cells. Then print them on any layer you need, and that tissue will be sustainable and work. We can hopefully reduce waiting times for all kinds of patients waiting for all kinds of transplants.\"</p><p>The procedure is part of an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial that assesses safety and tolerability in people with corneal endothelial disease. This achievement reflects years of work across research labs, operating rooms and industry. It also shows how coordinated teams can push new treatments from concept to clinical reality.</p><p>The breakthrough will have a permanent home in Rambam's upcoming Helmsley Health Discovery Tower. The new Eye Institute will consolidate care, training and research under one roof. It aims to speed the move from emerging science to real-world treatment for patients across Northern Israel and beyond.</p><p>Precise Bio says its <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/3d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3D printing system</a> could eventually support other tissues like cardiac muscle, liver and kidney cells. That future will require long trials and extensive validation, but the path now looks more achievable.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health/popular-weight-loss-drugs-linked-sudden-vision-loss-research-suggests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>POPULAR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS LINKED TO SUDDEN VISION LOSS, RESEARCH SUGGESTS</strong></a></p><p>If corneal disease affects someone in your family, this work brings new hope. Donor tissue may continue to play a role in many regions, but lab-grown implants offer a way to expand access where shortages hold patients back. The success of this first transplant also suggests a future where regenerative medicine supports many types of tissue repair.</p><p>This milestone also shows how long scientific breakthroughs take to reach real patients. The first 3D printed cornea design appeared in 2018 and only now reached human use.

    "content": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis</a> is divorced from the downtown area by a tangle of highway overpasses, and as it turns out, it\u2019s the perfect place for Somali immigrants in Minnesota to create an enclave that is much more Somali than American.</p><p>On the main drag, you can see the skeletal remains of shuttered non-Somali businesses, such as the aptly named Western World, an outerwear supplier that had stood in the location since 1970. Every newly opened business is Somali.</p><p>Block by block, under the steady gaze of the 1970s brutalist Riverside towers, now populated mostly by Somalis, the neighborhood is losing its old identity and transforming into something that looks more like Africa than Minnesota, aside from the snow, of course.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/inside-little-mogadishu-minnesotas-somali-community-its-push-belonging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>INSIDE \u2018LITTLE MOGADISHU\u2019: MINNESOTA\u2019S BELEAGUERED SOMALI COMMUNITY UNDER A CLOUD OF FRAUD AND TRUMP ATTACKS</u></strong></a></p><p>This is not new in America. Immigrant groups have long come to our nation and chosen to live in isolation with their own customs. The difference here is that the Somali community in Minnesota is also seeking, and gaining, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">political power</a> \u2014 not just in their neighborhood, but also across the state and even the federal government.</p><p>In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/how-misreading-somali-poverty-led-minnesota-its-largest-welfare-scandal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a massive fraud scandal</a> in which perhaps as much as a billion dollars intended to feed hungry kids was allegedly stolen by organizations with very close ties to the Somali community, local residents are starting to feel mounting frustration.</p><p>One man who agreed to go on video told Fox News Digital, \"I mean, I'm concerned, obviously, because there's no real accounting for any of this, and taxes continue to rise. Our bills go up on a regular basis, and yet there's no accountability for where any of this money goes.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/schemes-stacked-upon-schemes-1b-human-services-fraud-fuels-scrutiny-of-minnesotas-somali-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>\u2018SCHEMES STACKED UPON SCHEMES\u2019: $1B HUMAN-SERVICES FRAUD FUELS SCRUTINY OF MINNESOTA\u2019S SOMALI COMMUNITY</strong></a></p><p>The fact that a vast majority of those implicated in this public money scandal are Somali speaks to the level of political power the community has amassed on every level while barely assimilating at all to the broader culture.</p><p>One woman I spoke to, named Jane, in her late 30s and very sympathetic to immigrants, did admit, \"They kind of have their own thing going on.\"</p><p>Lius, a restaurant owner, also told Fox News Digital on video, \"With the Somali community, what bothers me is that I learned that they get <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/aid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all the benefits from the government</a>.

On many stores can be seen a green sign that reads \"Ramadpay,\" which is a Minneapolis-based money wire service that sends cash to several <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/islam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Muslim countries</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION</strong></a></p><p>So even in sending money home, the Somali community has managed to circumvent American banking systems and keep all the fees in the community.</p><p>The Somali community and its leaders, such as Rep. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ilhan-omar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ilhan Omar</a>, D-Minn., have a choice to make: either they can assimilate as so many other groups have before them \u2014 and take their place in state and federal politics \u2014 or they can stay isolated.</p><p>What cannot be allowed to continue is for this community to exert political pressure on the rest of the country while simultaneously claiming any oversight of that influence is bigoted. That game must be well and truly over.</p><p>In Cedar-Riverside, Western World is not just an out-of-business clothing store, it's a symbol of growing tension between <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/minnesota\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minnesota nice</a> and Somali-based graft.

Tony Dokoupil is the person to win it back,\" CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss said in a press release. \"That\u2019s because he believes in old school journalistic values: asking the hard questions, following the facts wherever they lead and holding power to account. Americans hungry for fairness will see that on display night after night.\"</p><p>\"Tony is what everyone wants in an evening-news anchor \u2013 authentic, compassionate, unafraid,\" CBS News President Tom Cibrowski said. \"He connects instantly, whether he\u2019s talking with world leaders or with families navigating difficult news in their own backyards.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/gayle-king-speaks-out-amid-reports-shes-exiting-cbs-mornings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>GAYLE KING SPEAKS OUT AMID REPORTS SHE'S EXITING \u2018CBS MORNINGS\u2019</strong></a></p><p>However, Dokoupil's appointment was not met with celebration among pundits outspoken against Israel.</p><p>\"Pro-Israel guy gets top job from new pro-Israel boss and new pro-Israel owner. Surprise!\" former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, now of Zeteo, reacted to a report that previewed Dokoupil's promotion. MSNBC changed its name officially last month to MS NOW.</p><p>\"Bari Weiss named Tony Dokoupil the new CBS Evening News anchor. In a wild coincidence, he happens to be the most pro-Israel anchor they have,\" The Young Turks host Cenk Uygur wrote with a laughing emoji. \"Don't worry, you already had the boomer to cadaver vote locked up for Israel.

This is why Ellison hired Weiss- to feed us right wing propaganda. Turn the channel!\" SiriusXM radio host Dean Obeidallah urged his X followers.</p><p>CBS News did not immediately respond to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox News Digital</a>'s request for comment.</p><p>Dokoupil's confrontation of Coates sparked internal strife at the network. CBS staffers expressed outrage toward the \"CBS Mornings\" co-host, who was reprimanded by bosses at the time for allegedly violating \"editorial standards.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bari-weiss-critics-inside-cbs-news-fall-two-distinct-camps-network-insider-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>BARI WEISS\u2019 CRITICS INSIDE CBS NEWS FALL INTO TWO DISTINCT CAMPS, NETWORK INSIDER SAYS</strong></a></p><p>While a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital that Dokoupil would not be punished over the interview, he was forced to meet with the network\u2019s in-house Race and Culture Unit following complaints. Notably, the Race and Culture Unit was gutted this fall as part of layoffs implemented by David Ellison after taking over CBS News' parent company Paramount.</p><p>The New York Post <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/08/media/cbs-tony-dokoupil-offers-regrets-at-teary-staff-meeting-after-grilling-anti-israel-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>also reported</u></a> that Dokoupil expressed regret to staffers at a meeting, with one network insider describing it, \"There were tears.

I think he handled himself and showed the world and modeled what civil discourse is,\" Redstone said amid the fallout. \"He showed that there was accountability, that there is a system of checks and balances, and frankly, I was very proud of the work that he did.\"</p><p>There has been a revolving door as \"CBS Evening News,\" the perpetual third place newscast behind ABC's \"World News Tonight\" and \"NBC Nightly News,\" has struggled to find an anchor to permanently lead the program since Dan Rather's scandal-plagued exit from the anchor desk in 2005. While Rather manned the desk for more than two decades, none of his successors have lasted longer than six years, including Katie Couric, Scott Pelley, Jeff Glor and Norah O'Donnell, who <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/norah-odonnell-exiting-cbs-evening-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stepped down</a> in January 2025 ahead of Dickerson and DuBois' brief stint.</p>",

Critics have suggested that litigation could have made the MDE nervous and caused state officials to let up on its supervision of Feeding Our Future, potentially letting more fraud occur.</p><p>\"Minnesota officials were accused of racism if they questioned the obviously fake claims,\" conservative commentator Jason Rantz wrote in an <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/minnesotas-massive-fraud-exposes-democrats-built-system-designed-robbed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">op-ed</a>. \"Feeding Our Future advocates figured that out early and used it as a shield, accusing officials of discrimination the moment anyone asked why the numbers didn\u2019t add up.\"</p><p>While state officials began questioning Feeding Our Future prior to 2020, the nonprofit went on offense that year and sued the MDE in state court, claiming that the department\u2019s lack of action on applications for new food distribution sites during the COVID-19 pandemic amounted to discrimination against Somalians.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://mncourts.gov/about-the-courts/newsandannouncements/feeding-our-future-v-minnesota-department-of-education-correcting-media-reports-and-statements-by-governor-tim-walz-concerning-orders-issued-by-the-court\" rel=\"nofollow\">lawsuit</a> was settled after about one month and involved the MDE agreeing to respond to the applications.\u00a0</p><p>But the litigation did not stop there.

    "content": "<p>Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, announced he would not seek re-election after a Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-allows-texas-use-trump-pushed-redrawn-congressional-redistricting-map-favoring-republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decision</a> upheld the redline Republicans had drawn through his district, a decision emblematic of the tough calculus Democrats face in the Lone Star State amid a new slate of congressional districts.\u00a0</p><p>Despite his personal loss, Doggett, 79, believes Democrats have a unique reason for optimism: he thinks Republicans have given themselves a vulnerability in their redistricting efforts by basing their rework on the results of the last election \u2014 and that in doing so they may have spread themselves too thin.\u00a0</p><p>\"My overall view is one of cautious optimism that people recognize that the midterm elections began this summer by Trump when he initiated the new redistricting,\" Doggett told Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think there are several state House seats that have become competitive that may not have been competitive last time,\" he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-turns-up-heat-red-state-republicans-blocking-new-congressional-maps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP TURNS UP THE HEAT ON RED-STATE REPUBLICANS BLOCKING NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAPS</strong></a></p><p>The Supreme Court\u2019s affirmation of the new maps cements new political realities in the Lone Star State designed to squeeze five Democrats out of office, and it puts to bed questions about the lawfulness of the change. Although Doggett\u2019s exit makes a Democratic victory in Texas\u2019 37th Congressional District more unlikely and has forced other Democrats like Rep. Marc Veasy, D-Texas, into similar retirement decisions, questions remain about whether those advantages are short-term gains or if Republicans can reliably expect to benefit in years to come.</p><p>Matthew Green, professor of political science at the Catholic University of America, said the new political landscape \u2014 like all gerrymandering efforts \u2014 is an advantage that will change over time.\u00a0</p><p>\"Gerrymandering can have different effects in differing states over time, but in general, partisan gerrymanders tend to \u2018stack the deck\u2019 towards one party or another,\" Green said. \"Texas is potentially unpredictable; Latinos are increasingly swing voters, so it's not clear what the results might be in 2026 and beyond.\"\u00a0</p><p>Like Green, Doggett also pointed to the Latino vote as a particularly large wild card that Texas Republicans will likely have to reckon with. He believes Republican redistricting efforts have assumed that the Latino community in Texas will continue its right-leaning trend of the last election. Latinos make up roughly 40% of the population in Texas, <a href=\"https://naleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2020-Census-Profiles-TX.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">according to data</a> from the 2020 census.</p><p>\"I see incredible engagement by people across ethnic and racial lines. But given the way the Republicans drew these districts, where they said they were basically packing Hispanics in some districts, I think that this could come back to create a problem for them,\" Doggett said.</p><p>In addition to shifting voting patterns among demographics, Doggett pointed out that Trump's messaging on immigration may not play as forcefully among voters as in 2024.</p><p>\"They are fighting the last war, and we're fighting one now, where many people recognize that Trump's promises on affordability and the like are not working. And so I think the immigration issue is not the kind of hammer that he was able to use last time,\" Doggett said.</p><p>Republican strategists responding to those comments said those vulnerabilities exist everywhere.</p><p>\"That's an interesting way to think about it,\" said a strategist familiar with the thinking of Republican candidates in Texas. \"The same case could be made in California or any other state that's redistricting, right? Like in general, [the advantages] are temporary, no matter what the map is.\"\u00a0</p><p>The source said Republicans \u2014 and Democrats in other states \u2014 are all attempting to push advantages they can find as the margin deciding the balance of power on Capitol Hill has continued to shrink in recent years.</p><p>\"You know, the days of having a House majority by more than 10, those are in the rearview mirror. The map is always going to be small, no matter what the redistricting situation is. So redistricting might help people right now, but it's always a game of inches. So there's always going to be a small margin no matter which party holds the House,\" the strategist said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/red-state-moves-forward-trump-backed-push-new-congressional-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>RED STATE MOVES FORWARD ON TRUMP-BACKED PUSH FOR NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAP</strong></a></p><p>Up until the Supreme Court\u2019s decision put the nail in the coffin, Doggett had been prepared to continue his public service.\u00a0</p><p>It was initially unclear if the new maps passed by the Texas Legislature in August would remain in place. Doggett had already announced his intention to retire but put those plans on hold when a lower court froze the implementation of the new maps, citing concerns that the new maps had gerrymandered along the lines of race in its 160-page <a href=\"https://www.texaspolicyresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gov.uscourts.txwd_.1150387.1437.0_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">ruling. </a><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/25a608_7khn.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">In its decision</a> on the matter, the Supreme Court wrote that the lower court had unfairly read race-based motives into the legislature\u2019s deliberations.</p><p>\"The District Court failed to honor the presumption of the legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature,\" the Supreme Court said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-allows-texas-use-trump-pushed-redrawn-congressional-redistricting-map-favoring-republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SCOTUS ALLOWS TEXAS TO USE TRUMP-PUSHED REDRAWN CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING MAP FAVORING REPUBLICANS</strong></a></p><p>Doggett\u2019s departure robs Democrats of a storied incumbent with deep ties to the region. Any alternative candidate the party might put up would likely face a harder time against a Republican opponent.\u00a0</p><p>Doggett, who was the first Democrat to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, last won re-election in 2024 with a 74.2%\u201323.6% victory over Republican candidate Jenny Garcia Sharon.</p><p>\"I am most appreciative for the opportunity to have represented our community in public office for most of the last 50 years \u2014 appreciative for the support and encouragement of so many neighbors as well as people from McAllen to San Antonio, from San Marcos to La Grange,\" Doggett wrote in a press release announcing his retirement.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Navy is warning that the United States must treat shipbuilding and weapons production with the urgency of a country preparing for conflict, with Navy Secretary John Phelan declaring that the sea service \"cannot afford to stay comfortable\" as it confronts submarine delays, supply-chain failures and a shipyard system he says is stuck in another era.</p><p>Phelan delivered the blunt message as he launched the service\u2019s new Rapid Capabilities Office \u2014 an organization he says will slash development timelines, hold programs accountable and inject commercial technology into the fleet far faster than the Pentagon\u2019s traditional acquisition system allows.\u00a0</p><p>\"We\u2019re shifting from process to performance,\" Phelan told an audience of defense companies, investors and Navy officials Tuesday in Washington. \"Programs are treated like entitlements. That ends now.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-expedite-nuclear-powered-subs-australia-sit-near-chinas-doorstep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>US TO EXPEDITE NUCLEAR-POWERED SUBS TO AUSTRALIA THAT WILL SIT NEAR CHINA\u2019S DOORSTEP</u></strong></a></p><p>His remarks come as the Navy faces years of criticism from Congress and outside analysts over submarine production delays, chronic maintenance bottlenecks and missed shipbuilding targets \u2014 problems service leaders warn now carry real strategic consequences. China, meanwhile, is racing ahead with heavily automated, AI-enabled shipyards that have allowed Beijing to expand its fleet far faster than the U.S.</p><p>Phelan urged shipyards and program offices to \"act like we\u2019re at war\" when it comes to production and readiness.</p><p>He argued that the Navy's existing acquisition model, in which major programs spend a decade navigating paperwork before reaching the fleet, is no longer viable.\u00a0</p><p>\"Modern weapons systems take 10 years or more to design. You\u2019d never accept that in private markets, and neither will we,\" he said. \"Our adversaries are not slowing down. We must evolve faster.\"\u00a0</p><p>His call for a wartime footing comes as <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>Beijing rapidly modernizes its navy</u></a> and pours AI-driven automation into its shipyards.\u00a0</p><p>Chinese state shipbuilders have spent the past decade building \"smart\" production lines that use machine learning to optimize welding, cut design cycles and predict bottlenecks in real time \u2014 advantages the U.S. industrial base has struggled to match.\u00a0</p><p>The Trump administration has been laser-focused on reversing that trend. China now has more than 230 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States, according to the Office of Naval Intelligence \u2014 a gap officials say underscores how urgently America must overhaul its acquisition system.</p><p>Analysts say China\u2019s ability to push new hulls into the water at a pace that dwarfs American production reflects its aggressive use of AI-assisted hull design, robotic welding and digital-twin modeling. With China experimenting with unmanned and autonomous vessels and accelerating its shipyard output, U.S. officials say the Navy can no longer afford slow decision cycles or yearslong contract delays.</p><p>After his speech, Phelan met with a small group of reporters alongside Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, a software and data company known for its work with U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, to explain one of the most concrete steps the Navy is taking to accelerate production: an AI-powered logistics and manufacturing platform known as <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/innovation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>Ship OS</u></a>. The Navy has awarded a $448 million investment to stand up the system and push AI-enabled tools across public and private shipyards.</p><p>Ship OS is being deployed first across the submarine industrial base \u2014 the most complex and backlogged segment of U.S. shipbuilding \u2014 before expanding to carriers and other platforms. But the effort faces the same challenge that has plagued previous Navy modernization attempts: whether shipyards, suppliers and the service itself can adopt new digital tools quickly enough to produce measurable gains.</p><p>Phelan said some shipyards still rely on processes that \"haven\u2019t changed since the 1980s,\" despite the complexity of modern submarines, which require millions of labor hours and thousands of bespoke parts. Ship OS, he argued, can spot breakdowns months before they halt production lines.\u00a0</p><p>\"Rather than hearing about a problem that day that will stop us, we will know 60, 90, 120, 180 days in advance,\" he said.</p><p>Karp said Ship OS unifies the data scattered across planning, maintenance and inventory systems that often don\u2019t speak to one another. Early tests, he said, have cut planning tasks that previously took 160 hours down to minutes and reduced material-review backlogs from weeks to under an hour.\u00a0</p><p>Asked whether the tool could help recover the Navy\u2019s slipping timeline on the Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine \u2014 now more than a year behind \u2014 Phelan said the system is already identifying opportunities to claw back time.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you want to move from one boat a year to two, the only way to do it is to understand in real time what\u2019s holding you up and what has to be fixed first,\" he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/china-military-reaches-war-footing-new-missile-silos-advanced-ai-warfare-systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CHINA MILITARY REACHES 'WAR FOOTING' WITH NEW MISSILE SILOS AND ADVANCED AI WARFARE SYSTEMS</u></strong></a></p><p>Beyond parts and schedules, Karp said the submarine industrial base is constrained by a shortage of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/manufacturing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>highly specialized labor</u></a> \u2014 a challenge software alone cannot solve.\u00a0</p><p>Submarine welding is so technically demanding that \"it takes more time to teach a welder how to weld on a nuclear submarine than a doctor,\" he said.</p><p>He argued that tools like Ship OS can help close that gap by capturing the knowledge of the Navy\u2019s most experienced craftsmen and making it usable by less-seasoned workers. The system, Karp said, is already enabling workers \"who would otherwise have the ability to do non-complicated welding\" to perform tasks that previously required elite specialists.</p><p>Former congressman and current Palantir head of defense Mike Gallagher said early pilots revealed how much inefficiency had been baked into daily operations. He pointed to repair yards where even routine decisions about what parts to buy were handled manually with whiteboards and scattered spreadsheets.\u00a0</p><p>\"It was entirely manual,\" Gallagher said. \"Now the same process is done in under an hour \u2014 and they\u2019re projecting more than 2,500 planning days a year saved.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/war-department-refocuses-ai-hypersonics-directed-energy-major-strategy-overhaul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>WAR DEPARTMENT REFOCUSES ON AI, HYPERSONICS AND DIRECTED ENERGY IN MAJOR STRATEGY OVERHAUL</u></strong></a></p><p>The Navy has not yet released data showing how widely those gains can be replicated across the industrial base, and similar past initiatives have struggled once programs scale beyond initial test sites.</p><p>The Ship OS initiative also marks a shift in how the Navy intends to hold contractors accountable. Unlike many Pentagon software deals, the effort is structured around measurable results, not billable hours. The Navy says Palantir will receive the full value of the contract only if the system produces documented gains in productivity and output.</p><p>\"You're forcing us to absorb risk,\" Karp said to Phelan. \"We get paid as we perform.\"\u00a0</p><p>Phelan said that approach will become the model for how the service evaluates new systems. \"We will tell you quickly what works and what doesn\u2019t,\" he said. \"If technology doesn\u2019t deliver, we will say so fast. And if it does perform, we will scale it just as fast.\"</p><p>\"The character of warfare is changing,\" Phelan said. \"We cannot afford to stay comfortable.\"</p>",

    "full_content": "The HDMI Forum, responsible for the HDMI specification, continues to stonewall open source. Valve's Steam Machine theoretically supports HDMI 2.1, but the mini-PC is software-limited to HDMI 2.0. As a result, more than 60 frames per second at 4K resolution are only possible with limitations.\n\nContinue after ad\n\nIn a statement to Ars Technica, a Valve spokesperson confirmed that HDMI 2.1 support is \"still a work-in-progress on the software side.\" \"We\u2019ve been working on trying to unblock things there.\"\n\nThe Steam Machine uses an AMD Ryzen APU with a Radeon graphics unit. Valve strictly adheres to open-source drivers, but the HDMI Forum is unwilling to disclose the 2.1 specification. According to Valve, they have validated the HDMI 2.1 hardware under Windows to ensure basic functionality.\n\nNo Change After Almost Two Years\n\nThe restriction imposed by the HDMI Forum was already criticized in early 2024 by an AMD employee responsible for Linux. Even then, according to AMD, they had submitted a functional, HDMI 2.1-compatible driver, which the HDMI Forum rejected.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the HDMI Forum rejected our proposal,\" it was stated at the time. \"At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements.\"\n\nOnly HDMI 2.1 offers sufficient bandwidth for 120 or 144 Hertz at 3840 \u00d7 2160 pixels without compression. Furthermore, this version introduced manufacturer-independent variable refresh rates (HDMI VRR). Valve enables 4K and 120 Hertz using chroma subsampling, a compression technique that is particularly noticeable with text. VRR functions in the form of AMD's Freesync, which requires compatible displays.\n\nContinue after ad\n\nAlternatively, interested parties can use an active adapter from DisplayPort 1.4 to HDMI 2.1 to increase the frame rate without compression. However, they do not officially support VRR. Popular variants from Club3D are no longer available; offers from less well-known providers (starting from 35,67 \u20ac) are still available in price comparisons.\n\n(mma)",

I can say ignore the patents to make my property work.- I have no relationship to the HDMI people.  (Never entered into a contract with them.)- The links to the spec are here. (Trade secrets/nda no longer apply.  This is the problem with using trade secrets to protect your stuff.)- If I point a coding assistant (assume open weights/source) at this thread, and a copy of linux main, it can probably just fix the damn driver.- I could probably publish my patch with a big fat \u201conly for use with licensed hdmi hardware, not for resale\u201d disclaimer on it.At that point, what law would I have broken?",

      "klipklop: It's about time somebody does some reverse engineering and just uploads the needed stuff online to make HDMI 2.1 work in Linux. It's getting absurd at this point. TV's need to start including Displayport, HDMI is a giant pain in the ass for gamers.",
      "aryonoco: Great news. HDMI can just go and die. If the HdMI Forum really thinks it\u2019s bigger than Linux, it\u2019s wrong. While category of devices in this space are just Linux only. Eventually, they\u2019ll add a DP port, eventually (10 years later)",
      "tclancy: Am I understanding correctly that the underlying issue is asking exorbitant prices to see the HDMI Forum\u2019s specs? Feels like you shouldn\u2019t be able to define an industry spec if you want to get paid for it, but maybe that would suppress smaller-scale, niche development.",

      "pseudosavant: The funny thing of course is that the Steam Machine has DisplayPort, and you can easily get a DisplayPort to HDMI 2.1 dongle for $20 retail. But they are targeting this being a console, and those are hooked to TVs over HDMI so it seems lame to not have a built-in HDMI port.This is mostly an academic exercise though. HDMI 2.0 does 4K @ 60hz, and Valve have 4K @ 120hz (with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling) working over it too. Given the CPU/GPU in this machine, it won't be able to push higher than those limits anyway.",
      "xvilka: Just promote DisplayPort and boycott HDMI.",

Smoothly done.It reminded me of Operation Neptune (1991): each level starts with just one channel, probably percussion, and as you progress through the rooms it adds and removes more channels or sometimes switches to a different section of music. It is unfortunately all sharp cuts, no attempts at smoothing or timing instrument entry and exit. A couple of samples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LNaatyoQk is an hour of gameplay revelling in \u201cthe dynamic and sometimes beautiful music of Operation Neptune\u201d using a Roland MT-32 MIDI synthesiser; and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPxEdQ4wx9s&list=PL3FC048B13... is the PCM files used on some platforms (if you want to compare that track with the MT-32, it starts at 28 minutes).",

    "content": "<div class=\"FeatureByline\">\n           By <b>Joe Brockmeier</b><br>December 10, 2025</br>\n           </div>\n<p>Linux containers have made it reasonably easy to develop, distribute, and\ndeploy server applications along with all the distribution dependencies that they\nneed. For example, anyone can deploy and run a Debian-based <a\nhref=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres\">PostgreSQL container</a> \non a Fedora&#160;Linux host. <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/\">Distrobox</a> is a project that is designed to\nbring the cross-distribution compatibility to the desktop and allow users to\nmix-and-match Linux distributions without fussing with dual-booting, virtual\nmachines, or multiple computers. It is an ideal way to install\nadditional software on image-based systems, such as Fedora's <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/\">Atomic Desktops</a>\nor <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1046228/\">Bazzite</a>, and also\nprovides a convenient way to move a development environment or\nfavorite applications to a new system.</p>\n\n<p>Distrobox creator Luca Di Maio <a\nhref=\"https://fedoramagazine.org/run-distrobox-on-fedora-linux/\">was\ninspired</a> by the <a href=\"https://containertoolbx.org/doc/\">Toolbx</a>\nproject (formerly Container Toolbox) for Fedora. Generally, the idea with Linux\ncontainers is to run processes in their own environment to isolate them as much\nas possible from the host without having to resort to virtual machines\nwith their additional overhead. It is possible, though, to set up a container to give it privileged\naccess to the system with little to no isolation. This is typically referred to\nas a <a\nhref=\"https://www.baeldung.com/linux/privileged-container-capabilities#privileged-containers\">privileged\ncontainer</a>.\nIt is possible to set up privileged containers manually, but it requires the\nuser to know a great deal about working with containers and some fairly involved\nsetup. The original goal for Toolbx was to let users run a privileged container\n\"toolbox\" on image-based systems that could be used for system administration\nand troubleshooting without having to include administration utilities in the\nimage itself.</p>\n\n<p>Toolbx has a somewhat limited scope: it works best with specific container images and was primarily developed to provide a software toolbox for\nimage-based Fedora editions like <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/\">CoreOS</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/\">Silverblue</a>. Toolbx is also\nlimited to the <a href=\"https://podman.io/\">Podman</a> container manager, which\nis not ideal for those who prefer to use <a\nhref=\"https://www.docker.com/get-started/\">Docker</a>. Di Maio wanted to have\nbroader compatibility with other Linux distributions as host operating systems\nas well as the ability to use a wide range of container images. He published the\nfirst release, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.0.0\">Distrobox&#160;1.0.0</a>,\nin December&#160;2021, under the GPLv3.</p>\n\n<p>The Distrobox project is, as its homepage notes, \"<q>a fancy\nwrapper</q>\" that works with Docker and Podman, with di Maio's own minimal\ncontainer manager, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/lilipod?tab=readme-ov-file#lilipod\">Lilipod</a>,\nas a fallback if the others are not present. Distrobox is written in POSIX\nshell, so that it is as portable as possible. The <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#aims\">project's\nprimary goal</a> is to allow the use of any Linux distribution containers on any\nLinux distribution host running one of the supported container managers. It also\nhas a goal of entering a container as quickly as possible, \"<q>every millisecond\nadds up if you use the container as your default environment for your\nterminal</q>\".</p>\n\n<p>Di&#160;Maio notes in the project's README that isolation and\nsandboxing of applications are non-goals: \"<q>on the contrary it aims\nto tightly integrate the container with the host</q>\". This means that\ncontainers run by Distrobox have access to the user's home directory, external\nstorage, USB devices, audio devices, and more. The idea of a sandboxed\nmode for Distrobox <a href=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28\">was\ndiscussed</a> but di&#160;Maio ultimately <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28#issuecomment-2408529939\">decided\nagainst</a> implementing one and has <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/pull/1806#issuecomment-3219301182\">opted\nnot to take patches</a> attempting to add isolation features: \"<q>the focus of\ndistrobox is not isolation, security or stuff, but integration and transparency\nwith the host</q>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\n\n<p>Distrobox is packaged for most popular Linux distributions, and the project\nhas a <a href=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#host-distros\">compatibility\ntable of host distributions</a> for those it has been tested on. The table \nhas notes with additional instructions if necessary. There is a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#containers-distros\">table of guest\ndistributions</a> as well that lists the container images that have been successfully\ntested with Distrobox. If a distribution is not mentioned in the host or guest\ntable it does not mean that Distrobox will not work; it simply indicates that\nthe combinations have not been tested. Users will also need one of the supported\ncontainer managers installed as well.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of how and why one might use Distrobox: the <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/#signal\">Signal</a> project only provides <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/download/linux/\">packages for Debian-based\ndistributions</a>, so there are no official packages for Arch, Fedora, openSUSE,\nor other non-Debian systems. There is a Flatpak available, but\nit is not maintained by the Signal project itself. It is possible to \ncompile Signal from source, but it is far easier to create a Debian Distrobox and\ninstall the official Signal package there:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox create -i debian:trixie -n signal -H ~/distrobox/signal\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox enter signal\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first command tells <tt>distrobox</tt> to create a new\ncontainer using the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> image with its home directory set to\n<tt>~/distrobox/signal</tt>, and to name it \"signal\". If the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> container image is not already present on the\nsystem, Distrobox will ask if you want to download it. Note that\nDistrobox uses the system's settings for short-name container\nlookup; it is also possible to pass the full registry path to\n<tt>distrobox</tt> if one prefers. The second command tells it to\nopen a shell inside the container (or <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-enter/\">enter</a> the container) so\none can work within its environment.</p>\n\n<p>All of that will probably look quite\nfamiliar to folks who work with Linux containers regularly, but\nDistrobox is doing quite a bit more behind the scenes. The\n\"<tt>--dry-run</tt>\" (or <span class=\"nobreak\">just \"<tt>-d</tt>\"</span>) option will print out the\ncommand that \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox create</tt></span>\" is\npassing to the container manager for inspection, without taking any\nactions. It's worth eyeballing the output to see what goes into\nsetting up a container that's well-integrated with the host system. In\nthe case of the example command here, there are more than 50 options\npassed to <tt>podman</tt>, including 17 volume mounts. That is a lot\nof container magic that the user is not required to fuss with or know\nabout, unless they want to.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things it does is to set up passwordless <tt>sudo</tt>\ninside the container, so one can immediately install packages in the container and so\nforth. Note that, by default, Distrobox executes the user's login\nshell when entering a container, but <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/useful_tips/#use-a-different-shell-than-the-host\">this\ncan be changed</a> if one wants to use (say) the Fish shell on the\nhost system but GNU Bash inside a Distrobox container.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of setting a home directory is not to provide isolation from the\nuser's home directory, but to avoid clutter. If no home directory is specified,\nthe guest container will <span class=\"nobreak\">use <tt>~/</tt></span>; that may be undesirable if one wants\nto maintain a separate set of configuration files or project directories in a\nDistrobox. Applications and processes in the Distrobox will still be able to\naccess files under the user's normal home directory. For example, if\nDistrobox container is set up with its home as\n<tt>/home/user/distrobox/signal</tt> then that will be set as\n<tt>$HOME</tt> for applications within the container. However, the\napplications can still access files in <tt>/home/user</tt>,\n<tt>/home/user/Documents</tt>, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>The <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-create/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;create</tt></a>\nman page provides a number of useful examples to help getting\nstarted. The \"<tt>distrobox&#160;create&#160;-C</tt>\" command will provide a\ncurrent list of images that are considered compatible with Distrobox. If a\ncontainer image is not listed as compatible, that does not mean it won't work,\njust that it has not been tested and confirmed to work.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, Distroboxes can be destroyed as well as created: \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox rm\n<em>name</em></tt></span>\" will remove a container. That does <em>not</em>,\nhowever, remove the container image from the system. If the goal is to\ncompletely purge the container image as well, then it's necessary to use the\ncontainer manager to do so, e.g. \"<tt>podman&#160;rmi&#160;<em>imagename</em></tt>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Exporting applications and moving containers</h4>\n\n<p>Since Distrobox is often used to run desktop applications, it does not make\nsense to have to enter the Distrobox container each time one wants to run Signal or some\nother application. The project provides a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-export/\">distrobox-export</a> command that sets\nup a <tt>.desktop</tt> file to launch the command directly from one's\ndesktop. For example, this will create a launcher for the Signal desktop client:\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox-export --app signal-desktop\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that the command should be run from within the container\ncreated by Distrobox, not on the host. Assuming that\nthe user is running a desktop environment like GNOME, KDE, or Xfce, an entry for\nSignal should show up in whatever menu or launcher is being used. Now it's not\nnecessary to use \"<tt>distrobox&#160;enter</tt>\" at all to run Signal, it can be\nrun like any other desktop application that is installed on the\nhost. Even though Distrobox prioritizes speed in starting containers,\nthere is usually a small but noticeable lag when launching an application from\na container that hasn't started yet.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, one might want to use a Distrobox container as their\nprimary command-line environment. Some terminal emulators, such as <a\nhref=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis#ptyxis-your-container-oriented-terminal-for-gnome\">Ptyxis</a>,\noffer integration with Distrobox and other container tools; a user can\nset Ptyxis to open new terminal windows in the container\nautomatically. This is particularly handy on image-based systems where\none cannot install software directly on the host using APT or DNF. I\nset Ptyxis to use a Fedora container by default and do my work in the\ncontainer and install additional software therein. To distinguish\nbetween working in the host terminal and in my default container, I\nset the color palette to \"Borland\" from the <a\nhref=\"https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/\">Gogh</a> set of color schemes\nfor terminals. The old-school look is appealing, and I don't get it\nconfused with the black-on-green theme for regular terminals.</p>\n\n<p>The \"<a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-assemble/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt></a>\"\ncommand can automate the creation of one or more Distroboxes. It takes\nan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">INI file</a> with\nspecifications on how to create a new container or multiple\ncontainers. For example, this is a simple <tt>distrobox.ini</tt> that\nwould create a container using a Fedora Rawhide image with several\npackages that I use regularly. The <tt>pull=true</tt> option tells\n<tt>distrobox</tt> to go ahead and pull the container image if it is\nnot available on the system.</p>\n\n<pre>\n    [rawhide]\n    additional_packages=\"emacs emacs-pgtk aerc tmux git lolcat bat\"\n    image=fedora:rawhide\n    pull=true\n    home=/home/jzb/distrobox/rawhide\n</pre>\n\n<p>Jorge Castro has written a <a\nhref=\"https://www.ypsidanger.com/declaring-your-own-personal-distroboxes/\">good\nblog post</a> on using \"<tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt>\" that is\nworth reading for anyone using Distrobox.</p>\n\n<p>The project is not on a time-based schedule, so releases are\nsomewhat sporadic. There is also no roadmap to follow for future\nreleases. Generally, Distrobox seems mostly feature complete, so\nnew versions seem to be mostly about bug fixes or catching up to\nchanges in Linux distributions and container tooling. The most recent\nfeature release was <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.0\">version&#160;1.8.2.0</a>\non October&#160;28 which included Bash completion enhancements, added\nsupport for new guest distributions, and included quite a few\ndocumentation changes as well as bug fixes. With that release,\ndi&#160;Maio also announced the addition of Alessio Biancalana as a\nmaintainer, and Biancalana has headed up the recent minor\nreleases. The most recent is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.2\">1.8.2.2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project does not, unfortunately, have a mailing list or even a web forum:\nthe documentation points users to a <a\nhref=\"https://matrix.to/#/%23distrobox:matrix.org\">Matrix room</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://t.me/distrobox_chat_new\">Telegram group</a> instead. Users\ninterested in making contributions or reporting bugs should check <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\"><tt>CONTRIBUTING.md</tt></a>\nfor guidance.</p>\n\n<p>I've found Distrobox to be enormously useful for providing an easy and quick\nway to run multiple distributions on a single system. Distrobox is probably one\nof my most-used applications after Firefox and Emacs. Multiple versions of Alpine Linux,\nCentOS&#160;Stream, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and others are just a few\nkeystrokes away any time I need them.</p>\n\n</p>",

Some terminal emulators, such as <a\nhref=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis#ptyxis-your-container-oriented-terminal-for-gnome\">Ptyxis</a>,\noffer integration with Distrobox and other container tools; a user can\nset Ptyxis to open new terminal windows in the container\nautomatically. This is particularly handy on image-based systems where\none cannot install software directly on the host using APT or DNF. I\nset Ptyxis to use a Fedora container by default and do my work in the\ncontainer and install additional software therein. To distinguish\nbetween working in the host terminal and in my default container, I\nset the color palette to \"Borland\" from the <a\nhref=\"https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/\">Gogh</a> set of color schemes\nfor terminals. The old-school look is appealing, and I don't get it\nconfused with the black-on-green theme for regular terminals.</p>\n\n<p>The \"<a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-assemble/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt></a>\"\ncommand can automate the creation of one or more Distroboxes. It takes\nan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">INI file</a> with\nspecifications on how to create a new container or multiple\ncontainers. For example, this is a simple <tt>distrobox.ini</tt> that\nwould create a container using a Fedora Rawhide image with several\npackages that I use regularly. The <tt>pull=true</tt> option tells\n<tt>distrobox</tt> to go ahead and pull the container image if it is\nnot available on the system.</p>\n\n<pre>\n    [rawhide]\n    additional_packages=\"emacs emacs-pgtk aerc tmux git lolcat bat\"\n    image=fedora:rawhide\n    pull=true\n    home=/home/jzb/distrobox/rawhide\n</pre>\n\n<p>Jorge Castro has written a <a\nhref=\"https://www.ypsidanger.com/declaring-your-own-personal-distroboxes/\">good\nblog post</a> on using \"<tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt>\" that is\nworth reading for anyone using Distrobox.</p>\n\n<p>The project is not on a time-based schedule, so releases are\nsomewhat sporadic. There is also no roadmap to follow for future\nreleases. Generally, Distrobox seems mostly feature complete, so\nnew versions seem to be mostly about bug fixes or catching up to\nchanges in Linux distributions and container tooling. The most recent\nfeature release was <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.0\">version&#160;1.8.2.0</a>\non October&#160;28 which included Bash completion enhancements, added\nsupport for new guest distributions, and included quite a few\ndocumentation changes as well as bug fixes. With that release,\ndi&#160;Maio also announced the addition of Alessio Biancalana as a\nmaintainer, and Biancalana has headed up the recent minor\nreleases. The most recent is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.2\">1.8.2.2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project does not, unfortunately, have a mailing list or even a web forum:\nthe documentation points users to a <a\nhref=\"https://matrix.to/#/%23distrobox:matrix.org\">Matrix room</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://t.me/distrobox_chat_new\">Telegram group</a> instead. Users\ninterested in making contributions or reporting bugs should check <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\"><tt>CONTRIBUTING.md</tt></a>\nfor guidance.</p>\n\n<p>I've found Distrobox to be enormously useful for providing an easy and quick\nway to run multiple distributions on a single system. Distrobox is probably one\nof my most-used applications after Firefox and Emacs. Multiple versions of Alpine Linux,\nCentOS&#160;Stream, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and others are just a few\nkeystrokes away any time I need them.</p>\n\n</p>",

    "content": "First, let me clarify that I think the CFP selections were ultimately as fair as they can be. If they had omitted either Bama or Miami, those teams would have just as big a gripe as Notre Dame, if not more so.\n\nThat said, I think fans are underestimating how big a role the broadcast partners play in shaping the entire landscape of college football. The networks are the ones paying the hundreds of millions of dollars for broadcast rights and therefore ultimately determine the outcome of things like conference realignment decisions. Likewise, they have a huge role in things like bowl selection as well. After all, the vast majority of the bowls have their broadcast rights with ESPN. So, whenever there is discretion in team selection as opposed to an auto-bid, the network has some influence based on the match-ups they prefer to air.\n\nGiven this reality, it sure looks like ESPN put their thumb on the scale and attempted to influence the CFP committee to take Bama and Miami over Notre Dame.\n\nFirst, consider that ESPN (and their parent company Disney/Warner Bros/Discovery which also owns ABC and TNT) has the broadcast rights for both the ACC (Miami) and the SEC (Bama), and ESPN is the network that also has the broadcast rights for the CFP. Notre Dame however has their broadcast rights with a competitor, NBC, who has no role in airing the CFP.\n\nThen consider the sequence of events. For weeks, Notre Dame was ranked ahead of both Bama and Miami, not only in the CFP poll, but in the AP poll, the coaches poll, and all of the computer rankings. They ALL had Notre Dame ranked first among that trio. But the CFP poll changed their rankings over the final two weeks. First, after Bama barely survived against Auburn on the same day that Notre Dame beat Stanford by more than 4 TDs, the CFP put Bama ahead of Notre Dame. Then, a week later, they put Miami ahead even though neither team played a game.\n\nAnd consider that ESPN specifically conducted a campaign to boost Miami's chances by repeatedly airing the Miami vs. Notre Dame game in a 24-hour marathon on the ACC Network on the Thursday and Friday before the final selections were made Saturday night.\n\nGranted, we'll never know for sure how much influence ESPN actually had in getting the committee to change their mind, but it's not exactly a \"conspiracy theory\" to suggest that they were clearly trying to get their broadcast partners into the tournament that they'd be airing.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of comments about ratings, but it's about promoting the teams that are their broadcast partners.\n\nAsk yourself why College Gameday was at the SEC Championship instead of the #1 vs. #2 game between Ohio State and Indiana. The Big Ten game got higher TV ratings, but that game was on Fox. So, they went to Atlanta and promoted their own game.",

    "content": "Not sure if there is a better place to post this. Just watched this movie for the first time actually and was immediately hooked by the concept and world building. Theres some cool parallels to draw with our world, and commentary to be made about capitalism and wealth inequality.\n\nEveryone in their world stops aging at 25 and uses their lifespan as currency. The poor struggle to even stay alive while the rich gamble and waste away decades. At the same time, people are still vulnerable to random acts of violence, so violence and robbery becomes rampant.\n\nThe movie starts off pretty strong and has a lot of positives I think, but it starts to fall apart later on. Lots of interesting concepts get brought up (a wealthy man at the beginning talks about being old enough to crave death, the poor do everything as quick as possible to make the most of time, and there are \"timekeeper\" cops to enforce rigid structure to the society).\n\nBut the movie never fully explains more from there, and then turns generic. Amanda Seyfrieds character is a rich man's daughter who almost immediately falls in love with the protagonist and joins his fight against the system. They fight the system by randomly robbing banks and distributing time.\n\nCillian Murphy also plays the main Timekeeper cop, but is oddly overzealous about enforcing a bizarrely shitty system. Hes shown to have an insane amount of loyalty to the rigid class structure *despite being born and raised in the ghetto*. He \"made it out\" somehow, but then devotes his life to making sure others don't, and then dies from it because he was still pretty damn poor as a cop.\n\nOverall still an interesting watch but just wish we got a lot more. Background on the system and more explanations would have been way better than a generic love story and cookie cutter standoff.\n\nIts been a while since this came out, but anyone else think similar?\n\n\n",

      "u/markatlarge: I'm glad this story got out there, and I really want to thank Emanuel Maiberg for reporting it. I'm an independent developer with no clout, and I lost access to my Google account for several months. Nothing changed until Emanuel reached out to Google.\n\nThe real story here is how broken the system is. In my appeal, I told Google exactly where the dataset came from. I even contacted people in Google's Trust &amp; Safety and developer teams. No one responded. The dataset remained online for more than two months until I reported it to C3P, which finally led to it being taken down.\n\nHere's what really gets me: that dataset had been publicly available for 6 years and contained known CSAM images. So what's the point of these laws that give big tech massive powers to scan all our data if they let this stuff sit out there for 6 years? They banned me in hours for accidentally finding it, but the actual problem went unaddressed until I reported it myself.  \n\nIf your interested in the subject I encourage you to read some of my medium posts.",

The digital world is both the best and worst thing that could happen to society. I wonder if there ever was something else in time that was viewed the same.",
      "u/Hrmbee: Concerning details:\n\n&gt;The incident shows how AI training data, which is collected by indiscriminately scraping the internet, can impact people who use it without realizing it contains illegal images. The incident also shows how hard it is to identify harmful images in training data composed of millions of images, which in this case were only discovered accidentally by a lone developer who tripped Google\u2019s automated moderation tools. \n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;In October, Lloyd Richardson, C3P's director of technology, told me that the organization decided to investigate the NudeNet training data after getting a tip from an individual via its cyber tipline that it might contain CSAM. After I published that story, a developer named Mark Russo contacted me to say that he\u2019s the individual who tipped C3P, but that he\u2019s still suffering the consequences of his discovery.\n&gt;\n&gt;Russo, an independent developer, told me he was working on an on-device NSFW image detector. The app runs locally and can detect images locally so the content stays private. To benchmark his tool, Russo used NudeNet, a publicly available dataset that\u2019s cited in a number of academic papers about content moderation. Russo unzipped the dataset into his Google Drive. Shortly after, his Google account was suspended for \u201cinappropriate material.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;On July 31, Russo lost access to all the services associated with his Google account, including his Gmail of 14 years, Firebase, the platform that serves as the backend for his apps, AdMob, the mobile app monetization platform, and Google Cloud. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cThis wasn\u2019t just disruptive \u2014 it was devastating. I rely on these tools to develop, monitor, and maintain my apps,\u201d Russo wrote on his personal blog. \u201cWith no access, I\u2019m flying blind.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;Russo filed an appeal of Google\u2019s decision the same day, explaining that the images came from NudeNet, which he believed was a reputable research dataset with only adult content. Google acknowledged the appeal, but upheld its suspension, and rejected a second appeal as well. He is still locked out of his Google account and the Google services associated with it. \n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;After I reached out for comment, Google investigated Russo\u2019s account again and reinstated it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cGoogle is committed to fighting the spread of CSAM and we have robust protections against the dissemination of this type of content,\u201d a Google spokesperson told me in an email. \u201cIn this case, while CSAM was detected in the user account, the review should have determined that the user's upload was non-malicious. The account in question has been reinstated, and we are committed to continuously improving our processes.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cI understand I\u2019m just an independent developer\u2014the kind of person Google doesn\u2019t care about,\u201d Russo told me. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly why this story matters. It\u2019s not just about me losing access; it\u2019s about how the same systems that claim to fight abuse are silencing legitimate research and innovation through opaque automation [...]I tried to do the right thing \u2014 and I was punished.\u201d\n\nOne of the major points of concern here is (yet again) big tech on one hand promising convenience in exchange for using their suites of services, and on the other hand acting arbitrarily and sometimes capriciously when it comes to locking people out of their accounts. That it takes inquiries from journalists for people to have their accounts reinstated is deeply troubling, and speaks to a lack of responsiveness by these companies. It would be well worth it for those who are able to either self-host or to at least spread out that risk between a number of different providers.\n\nSecondarily, there is also an issue here of problematic data contained within ML training sets, and more broadly of data quality here. As with all systems, GIGO, so if systems are trained on bad data then their outputs are going to be bad as well.",

    "content": "<p>From Friday's order by Judge William Ray (N.D. Ga.) in <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.312352/gov.uscourts.gand.312352.77.0.pdf\"><em>Boston v. Williams</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Plaintiffs, acting through their attorney Loletha Denise Hale (\"Attorney Hale\"), have filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's granting of summary judgment to the Defendant on the Plaintiffs' Complaint against him. The basis for the Court's granting summary judgment was that the Plaintiffs, through the inaction of their attorney, did not display the due diligence required under Georgia law to serve the Defendant with the Complaint within the applicable statute of limitations&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply appealing that ruling, which the Plaintiffs have every right to do, Plaintiffs now asks the Court to reconsider it on the basis of their previous argument that the Court is biased against them due to the Court's alleged bias against their lawyer, Attorney Hale. Their claim in that regard is centered on comments that the Court made at the oral argument on the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. Thus, a little review of the case history is in order.</p>\n<p>The Plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. And, in preparing for oral argument on the Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court read that brief, wherein Attorney Hale wrote (and cited case authority for the proposition) that the issue as to whether the Plaintiffs exercised due diligence in their efforts to serve the Defendant with process was a question of fact for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p>This argument was interesting and very strange. In the Presiding Judge's 35 years [by \"Presiding Judge,\" the judge presumably means himself -EV] as a member of the State Bar of Georgia, 23 which have been as a judge at the State and Federal level, it had always been his understanding that the issue of diligence in service efforts was one for the Court, not for a jury. But, as the Plaintiffs cited case precedent for this proposition, the Presiding Judge read the cited authority to see if the Plaintiffs might be right (and whether the Presiding Judge might be wrong).</p>\n<p>Upon reading the case, it was clear that it was the Plaintiffs (or rather, Attorney Hale) who were wrong. As the Defendant pointed out in his Reply Brief, an overwhelming number of the cases cited throughout the Plaintiffs' Brief in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment either were completely fabricated/hallucinated or did not stand for the proposition for which they were cited. In other words, they were fake.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360424\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>At the ensuing oral argument, Attorney Hale's explanation for the situation was just as bad: she admitted that the original brief she filed included many misrepresentations, but she contended her only mistake was filing the wrong brief. Attorney Hale represented to the Court that the original brief was drafted by her daughter (who does not appear to be an attorney) using AI. Attorney Hale contended that her daughter was helping her, as Attorney Hale was indisposed due to health issues of a friend. Attorney Hale contended that she had prepared another, real brief without false or fraudulent cases, but that she mistakenly filed with the Court the one that her daughter drafted for her that contained the AI hallucinations.</p>\n<p>This explanation was concerning to the Court. Not only had Attorney Hale filed a brief which was rife with misstatements of the law, but also she was admitting that she had her non-attorney daughter draft it for her. The Presiding Judge certainly did express his belief that her actions may have violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Additionally, at that hearing the Presiding Judge also articulated that he was particularly surprised that Attorney Hale would submit such a grievously fraudulent pleading given a previous occasion where Attorney Hale, then as a plaintiff in a case, had provided testimony in a jury trial before the same Presiding Judge that she later admitted was misleading and/or untrue.</p>\n<p>The argument on the merits of the Motion for Summary Judgment fared no better for the Plaintiffs, as it was clear that the Court likely would grant the Defendant's motion, although the Court reserved ruling. The Court also issued a show cause notice on September 8th of a possible Rule 11 violation by Attorney Hale and scheduled a hearing thereon to occur on September 29, 2025. Coincidentally (or not), the Plaintiffs thereafter filed a Motion to Recuse the Presiding Judge. The Court denied that motion in an order dated September 23, 2025.</p>\n<p>The Rule 11 Show Cause hearing wasn't particularly illuminating in explaining how the bad brief with fraudulent case cites came about, as Attorney Hale presented no evidence, such as having her daughter testify about the drafting of the brief. She also declined to make much of an argument in her defense, claiming she would rest on the record. Her basic position and tone were that the Presiding Judge was being unfair and that this was much ado about nothing.</p>\n<p>The Court issued an order on October 28, 2025, finding that Attorney Hale had, indeed, committed a Rule 11 violation. The Court exercised its discretion not to levy a fine against Attorney Hale, but did sanction her by requiring her to notify [existing] clients of the violation and also requiring her to file a notice of the violation in any case in which she appeared as counsel in the Northern District of Georgia for the next 5 years. [The Court later granted summary judgment.] &hellip;</p>\n<p>The Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Granting Summary Judgment is largely a repackaging of the arguments which the Plaintiffs previously have made that the Presiding Judge should have recused himself and why the Defendant wasn't entitled to summary judgment on the service issue. What is new, however, it that the Plaintiffs point to a recent complaint lodged against Attorney Hale by the State Bar of Georgia regarding her filing of the AI infected brief with the Court. The Plaintiffs claim that the Presiding Judge filed a bar complaint against Attorney Hale, which allegedly further supports their position that the Presiding Judge should not have decided the merits of the Motion for Summary Judgment&hellip;.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, perhaps it would have been more advisable for the Court not to have sent the Rule 11 Order to the State Bar until after the forthcoming appeal in this case is decided. But, at the time that the Court sent the order to the State Bar, it had already issued summary judgment to the Defendant, there were no pending matters in this case, and the case had been terminated in the Court's records.</p>\n<p>In the Court's view, the actions of Attorney Hale of filing a brief loaded with hallucinated cases and incorrect statements of the law (in addition to having a non-attorney draft the brief) in an effort to convince the Court to rule in favor of the Plaintiffs on the Motion for Summary Judgment warranted investigation by the State Bar. Honesty of attorneys appearing before the Federal and State courts of Georgia is not a trivial matter.</p>\n<p>The Court was also mindful of Rule 8.3(a) of the Code of Professional Conduct applicable to lawyers in this state, which states that \"[a] lawyer having knowledge that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, should inform the appropriate professional authority.\" Given that appeals can take anywhere from 6 months to a year or longer to get a ruling, giving notice to the State Bar of this issue when the Presiding Judge did seem appropriate.</p>\n<p>This Court denies the Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration and Motion to Vacate Judgment. It contains the \"same old - same old\" allegations, supplemented only by the additional fact that the Court forwarded its Order on the Rule 11 violations to the State Bar, an act that the Presiding Judge believed he was obligated by ethical considerations to do.</p>\n<p>In closing, it's not lost on the Court that the filing of this current motion drips with irony, as the Plaintiffs are arguing that the Presiding Judge cannot be fair (or that at least the situation presents an appearance of a conflict of interest). Yet, the Plaintiffs seek another ruling from the Presiding Judge, which is seemingly acceptable\u2014as long as it's in their favor. They can't have it both ways.</p>\n<p>In any event, the best course going forward is for this matter to end in the District Court and for the Plaintiffs to take their grievances to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. If the Circuit Court agrees with the Plaintiffs and disagrees with this Court's judgment, either in how it handled this matter procedurally or in how it resolved the Motion for Summary Judgment, that is ok. This Court has no interest in this case, other than it should be decided fairly pursuant to the substantive law and consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/10/judges-having-referred-lawyer-to-state-bar-for-alleged-ai-hallucinations-doesnt-require-judge-to-recuse/\">Judge&#039;s Having Referred Lawyer to State Bar for Alleged AI Hallucinations Doesn&#039;t Require Judge to Recuse</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Peter E. Harrell &amp; Jennifer Hillman (Lawfare) had an interesting post yesterday, \"<a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/unexpected-questions-in-learning-resources-v.-trump\">Unexpected Questions in Learning Resources v. Trump</a>,\" with the subtitle \"Are IEEPA tariffs permitted as either a lesser form of an embargo or the equivalent of a license fee? In short: no.\" An excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first unexpected issue that merited extensive discussion [at the oral argument in the tariff case] is one of the most intuitively appealing arguments in favor of the government's case: IEEPA clearly authorizes a president to embargo or block all trade, and presidents have used IEEPA with little challenge to impose trade embargoes against countries such as <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-560?toc=1\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">Iran</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-510?toc=1\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">North Korea</a>. If IEEPA authorizes embargoes, shouldn't the statute include the seemingly lesser power to tariff? Several justices were interested in whether, if IEEPA allowed embargoes but not tariffs, there would be\u2014as Justice Brett Kavanaugh put it\u2014an \"odd donut hole in the statute.\" &hellip;</p>\n<p>This argument has a certain intuitive appeal. However, it is wrong as a matter of both text and history. As Gutman said when he was pressed on the issue, the lack of a tariff power in IEEPA is \"not a donut hole\" but, rather, reflects that tariffs are \"a different kind of pastry.\"</p>\n<p>First, as a matter of history, Congress has often delegated an embargo power to the president without delegating a subsidiary tariff power. In 1794, for example, Congress delegated to President Washington\u00a0<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4939935\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">a broad power to impose or remove an embargo</a>\u00a0on U.S. trade during the five months that Congress planned to be out of session. This law empowered the president to block or allow effectively all U.S. trade, but it did not empower him to change statutory tariff rates. When Congress initially passed IEEPA's predecessor statute, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/40/STATUTE-40-Pg411.pdf\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">Trading with the Enemy Act</a>\u00a0(TWEA), in late 1917\u2014several months after America's entry into World War I\u2014it both included an expansive prohibition on trade and financial transactions with enemy nationals and authorized the president to suspend certain prohibitions and/or issue licenses authorizing American companies to engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited. But TWEA did not authorize President Wilson to set new tariff rates on trade with Germany or any of its allies.</p>\n<p>In recent decades, Congress has enacted additional sanctions and other embargoes on countries such as\u00a0<a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/5706/download?inline\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">Cuba</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/5691/download?inline\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">Iran</a>\u00a0but did not empower the president to raise tariffs on those countries. In 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Biden used IEEPA to impose myriad sanctions on Russia, including to embargo imports of various products, such as Russian oil. But it was Congress that in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7108\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">April 2022 voted to repeal Russia's most-favored-nation</a>\u00a0trading status and to authorize the president to raise tariff rates on Russia. This suggests that neither Congress nor the president viewed IEEPA as providing the authority to raise tariffs without congressional action.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360411\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Second, as a matter of textual analysis, there is little support for the government's argument that IEEPA includes a power to tariff as a derivative of an embargo power. In\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1287/375365/20250919182906186_24-1287ts_Govt_IEEPATariffs_final.pdf\" data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\">its briefings to the Court</a>, the government cited several dictionary definitions of \"regulate,\" but none of those definitions included words such as \"tariff,\" \"tax,\" or \"duty.\" As the justices drew out at oral argument, the government can identify no other statute in which the power to regulate something\u2014such as the power to regulate pollution or to regulate securities trades\u2014has included the power to tax it, unless the statute explicitly authorized a tax or a fee. And as Justice Barrett noted at oral argument, in IEEPA the power to regulate occurs alongside a set of other powers\u2014such as to \"direct\" and to \"prohibit\"\u2014that have discrete meanings, suggesting that \"regulate,\" too, should be read to have a discrete meaning rather than being an open-ended authority for the president to do whatever he sees fit upon invoking IEEPA. This is also consistent with Congress's desire to give the president direct control over stopping trade if a national emergency necessitates such action, whereas the imposition of tariffs cedes that control to U.S. importers, who can decide whether to continue importing and pay the tariffs or not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There's much more there on that, and on what \"licenses\" means in IEEPA; read the <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/unexpected-questions-in-learning-resources-v.-trump\">whole thing</a> if you're interested. My Hoover colleague Philip Zelikow, who cosigned an amicus brief in the case, adds a complementary perspective:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Embargoes are about blocking trade, not taxing it. Licenses are about whether to grant permissions to trade, not whether or how to tax it. Fees are only incidental to the grant of permission.</p>\n<p>These are measures that originate in actions the U.S. takes against its enemies (or the analog in designated firms and persons). The legal authority to block trade historically overlapped with wartime measures and war powers.</p>\n<p>Laws governing commerce with countries with whom we have normal trade relations are in a fundamentally different category. The President could treat a country as an enemy and block trade with it. But he cannot tax normal commerce on his own authority, or the emergency authorities granted in IEEPA&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Harrell &amp; Hillman's last argument, the one about whether the tariffs can be defended as \"regulatory\" rather than \"revenue-raising,\" is also well stated. [I] also don't think there is such a creature as a \"regulatory\" tariff, a tax that becomes lawful, without congressional authorization, if paired with that adjective. But if someone did believe in that, Harrell &amp; Hillman explain why it can't be distinguished from the taxes that raise revenue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/10/tariffs-embargoes-and-license-fees/\">Tariffs, Embargoes, and License Fees</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

While the president claims this policy will \"support American Jobs, strengthen U.S. Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers,\" it's more likely that this method of picking winners and losers will create a cascading effect of negative consequences beyond this administration.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/trump-will-let-nvidia-sell-chips-to-china-but-the-feds-will-get-25-percent-of-the-profits/\">Trump Will Let Nvidia Sell Chips to China\u2014but the Feds Will Get 25 Percent of the Profits</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

An additional sign states, \"The Holy Family is safe in The Sanctuary of our Church&hellip;If You see I.C.E. Please Call LUCE At 617-370-5023.\" The priest has defied calls from both Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Archdiocese of Boston to remove the signs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rev. Stephen Josoma of St. Susanna Parish </span><a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/12/05/catholic-religon-immigration-protest\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">told</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> WBUR that the scene is meant to focus the Christmas story on the plight of immigrants, citing conversations with refugee families living in fear of deportation after coming to the U.S. from countries such as Honduras, Guatemala, and Afghanistan. \"These are folks who carry a lot of scars with them. Some of them are physical scars, but most are emotional,\" he told WBUR. \"They've seen their folks killed in front of them.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"You feed the hungry, you take care of the homeless, you clothe the naked, you take care of people and their needs,\" Josoma </span><a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/03/metro/dedham-church-nativity-ice-protest/#:~:text=The%20priest%20at%20a%20Catholic,is%20clear%20about%20%20112\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">told</span></a> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Boston Globe</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. \"[ICE raids] are the complete antithesis of that on so many levels.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The scene has drawn criticism from both church and state. Terry Donilon, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Boston, said in a </span><a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/12/ice-director-demands-mass-church-remove-ice-was-here-nativity-scene.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MassLive.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0that the \"divisive political messaging\" should be removed, while pointing to </span><a href=\"https://www.usccb.org/news/2025/us-bishops-issue-special-message-immigration-plenary-assembly-baltimore\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">statements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that call for the humane treatment of immigrants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, both ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have condemned the church's speech. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons called for the removal of the Nativity scene in a </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ice-director-boston-archdiocese-demand-ice-here-nativity-removed-from-mass-church\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to Fox News, saying, \"The actions of the activist reverend, Stephen Josoma, are absolutely abhorrent and add to a dangerous narrative responsible for a more than 1,150% increase in assaults on ICE officers.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, </span><a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/12/ice-director-demands-mass-church-remove-ice-was-here-nativity-scene.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">told</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MassLive.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, \"Not only is this 'nativity' scene offensive to Christians, but it is also depicting something that\u2014despite what Rev. Josoma says\u2014NEVER happens. ICE does not separate families&hellip;.Get a grip and seek help.\"</span></p>\n<p>Despite McLaughlin's insistence, the agency has, in fact, separated immigrant families. In October, a case of a 13-year-old Massachusetts boy from Brazil made headlines after he was <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/20/13-year-old-boy-arrested-by-ice-still-waiting-for-a-bond-hearing-more-than-11-days-later/\">detained</a> by ICE rather than being released to his mother following his arrest by the Everett Police Department. The boy was subsequently transported to a Virginia detention center over 500 miles away without his family's or his attorney's knowledge. More cases have come to light, including a 6-year-old boy in Queens who was detained by ICE and separated from his Chinese father. And a recent <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-detentions-immigrant-kids-family-separations\">report</a> from\u00a0<em>ProPublica\u00a0</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">found that ICE has sent about 600 immigrant children to detention this year\u2014a number higher than the previous four years combined\u2014suggesting more families have also been separated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regardless of any disagreement that ICE or the DHS may have with Josoma over his church's Nativity scene\u2014should he choose to keep it\u2014this kind of speech is firmly </span><a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1-6/ALDE_00000040/#:~:text=Supreme%20Court%20cases%20recognizing%20protections,507%2C%20523%20(2022)%20.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">protected</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> under the First Amendment.

Any decision to remove the scene should be left up to the church.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite all the pushback, Josoma and about 10 other St. Susanna parishioners gathered on Monday to defend the display, </span><a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/12/dedham-priest-defends-ice-was-here-nativity-scene-after-political-pushback.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">according</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MassLive.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Josoma said the scene has been received positively, and he is waiting to speak with the archbishop of Boston, Richard Henning, before removing the scene. \"The church has a right to speak out,\" Josoma </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/church-sparks-controversy-empty-nativity-scene-ice-enforcement-message-politicizing-christmas\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">told</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Fox News. \"And we should be talking about issues.

In cities around the world, free or cheap parking leads to a familiar scene: drivers endlessly circling the block, waiting to happen upon someone leaving. Urban planners call it \"cruising for parking.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In congested areas, drivers looking for a spot account for nearly </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1884829988/reasonmagazinea-20/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of traffic. In Los Angeles' Westwood Village, for example, drivers </span><a href=\"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2011/04/30/donald-shoup/let-prices-do-planning/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">circled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the equivalent of 950,000 extra miles and burned through 47,000 gallons of gasoline in a year, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> looking for a place to park.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wasted time, wasted gas, clogged streets, air pollution\u2014these are the hidden costs of underpricing the curb, as UCLA economist Donald Shoup argued in his 800-page, 2005 classic tome, </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1884829988/reasonmagazinea-20/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The High Cost of Free Parking</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In theory, the fix is simple. As Shoup argues, cities should price curb space based on supply and demand and then reinvest the revenue in infrastructure improvements. The price of a spot should be targeted so that one or two spots remain open on every city block.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, city planners often require that developers add </span><a href=\"https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parking spaces when erecting new buildings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Those mandates eat up space, </span><a href=\"https://la.streetsblog.org/2014/10/17/new-ca-database-shows-how-much-parking-costs-and-how-little-its-used\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> construction costs, and make housing more expensive, without ever addressing the root problem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guatemala City doesn't mandate new parking, nor does it price its streets. This tragedy of the commons, however, created an entrepreneurial opportunity.</span></p>\n<h1><b>Imposing Order</b></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking in Guatemala City is organized chaos. There are no meters, no apps, and no permits, and yet every day, cars line the curb, attendants whistle and wave, drivers hand over cash, and finding a place to put your vehicle is mostly hassle-free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parking attendants known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (roughly translated as \"those who take care of cars\") impose order on the streets by assigning prices to unclaimed public parking spots.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are everywhere in Guatemala City\u2014lingering on street corners, waving rags to signal open spots, or counting cash. They blend into the urban fabric.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their job is to unofficially \"manage\" parking by staking out spaces with buckets, cones, or bottles, and then charging drivers to park in them. Most </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work long hours\u2014eight to 12 hours a day, five to six days a week\u2014and treat their turf as an asset. Some even run small-scale operations with shift rotations and a payroll.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their property rights are informal. Some inherited a stretch of curb from a relative; others are invited by nearby shop owners who want someone to deter theft. A few simply arrived one day and homesteaded a spot.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A woman I met named Mar\u00eda inherited her turf when her mother died. Another </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> named Miguel told me his parking business grew by accident. \"It's not like I set out to do this,\" he said. \"One day someone asked, 'Can I park here?' and I said, 'Sure, why not?' They asked, 'How much?' and I told them, 'Whatever you want to pay.' That's how it all began.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Miguel's business took off. He hired a team of assistants to cover nearby blocks in shifts, and they hand over a share of their earnings.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The industry developed a structure. There are generally two main shifts: a daytime crew that serves workers and students from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m., and a nighttime crew with a clientele consisting mostly of restaurant and bar owners, which runs until around 1:30 a.m.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prices vary depending on location and shift. It's more expensive to park in a busy nightlife district than in a quiet residential one. Parking at night might cost double. During peak hours or special events, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> adjust rates on the spot, a form of the \"dynamic pricing\" advocated by Shoup.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also collaborate. They respect each other's boundaries, share information, and occasionally mediate disputes. \"We all help each other,\" said a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \"If someone's sick, another takes the street for the day.\"</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earn about $6.50 a day, which is less than the median income in Guatemala City, but it's enough to get by and stay off the streets.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I interviewed Tony, he was constantly being greeted by neighborhood shop owners, clients, and delivery drivers. Everyone seemed to know him.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Familiarity builds trust. Some </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cuida carros</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often hold on to customers' keys, moving their cars when a garage needs to open or a delivery truck needs space.

Under a bill being prepared by French National Assembly member Jean-Philippe Tanguy, these brothels would operate as sex-worker-run cooperatives.</p> <p>Marine Le Pen, the former National Rally president and current National Assembly member who has run for president three times, also supports the brothel initiative, Tanguy said.</p>  <p>Tanguy told<em> Le Monde</em> that he got interested in the issue after working with a group that helps sex workers and meeting women who were leading very tough lives and women who were very proud of their work. He said he's come to believe that the current legal framework, in which paying for sex is illegal, does not actually make life better or safer for sex workers, since it drives the industry underground\u2014where violence still takes place, but people ignore it. He called the system \"the height of bourgeois hypocrisy.\"</p> <p>It was only in 2016 that France made paying for sex acts a crime. But the country officially ended its legal brothel system back in 1946. (Prostitution still remained technically legal, but many activities related to it were criminalized.)</p> <p>Interestingly, the woman who advocated for the brothel closures\u2014Marthe Richard, a former spy and sex worker whom the law was named after\u2014later seemed to regret it, saying that prostitution couldn't be eradicated and brothels were a \"lesser evil,\" <a href=\"https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/front-national/le-rassemblement-national-prepare-une-proposition-de-loi-pour-rouvrir-les-maisons-closes-sous-un-autre-nom_AN-202512080689.html\">according to</a> the French radio and TV network BFM.</p> <p>A move to decriminalize clients and allow sex workers to work together would be a step in the right direction for sex worker rights and safety. But any plan that allows this <em>exclusively</em> in brothels would still perpetuate many of the harms of criminalization.</p> <p>\"Brothels yes very well, but it must be an OPTION, not an obligation,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/PlusLibQ/status/1998319117191803248\">suggested</a> French commentator Edouard Hesse on X, urging Tanguy to listen to sex workers. \"We need to decriminalize this activity, protect rights, fight against coercion.\"</p> <p>Forging an alliance between the far-right party and sex worker rights advocates could prove difficult, no matter the particulars. Parisian sex worker Myl\u00e8ne Juste, a spokesperson for the group STRASS, told <em>Le Monde</em> there was no way they were going to ally with the National Rally, a nationalist and populist party that wants to drastically reduce French immigration.</p> <p>But National Rally politicians aren't the only ones who want to revise France's prostitution laws. Philippe Juvin, a Republican member of the National Assembly who last year introduced a bill aimed at securing sex worker rights, said this is also an issue he intends to revisit.</p> <p>Juvin complained to <em>Le Monde</em> about the current situation, in which both social stigma and the law prohibit sex workers from working safely and normally. He cited Belgium\u2014where <a href=\"https://reason.com/2022/03/23/belgium-decriminalizes-prostitution/\">sex work was decriminalized</a> in 2022 and <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/05/20/belgium-protects-sex-work-employees-right-to-refuse-customers-sex-acts/\">further moved to secure sex worker rights</a> and autonomy last year\u2014as a good model to follow.</p> <hr /> <h1>More Sex &amp; Tech News</h1> <p><strong>Families want to revisit Tim Ballard/Net Nanny convictions</strong>: Disgraced sex-trafficking \"rescue\" guru Tim Ballard, founder of the vigilante group Operation Underground Railroad, helped Washington state conduct \"Operation Net Nanny\" stings that \"landed hundreds in prison and put hundreds more on lifetime sex offender registries,\" <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/net-nanny-washington-state-police-stings/\">notes</a> <em>The Appeal.</em> When Ballard was accused of sexual misconduct and trafficking himself, \"the families of the men Operation Net Nanny sent to prison began asking why no one was willing to take a second look at their loved ones' convictions.\"</p> <p><strong>President Donald Trump wants to put a stop to state laws regulating artificial intelligence.</strong> \"A draft executive order that circulated last month directed the U.S. attorney general to sue states to overturn A.I. laws,\" <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/us/politics/trump-executive-order-ai-laws.html\">reports</a> <em>The New York Times</em>. \"Federal regulators were also directed to withhold broadband grants and other funding to states with A.I. laws.\" On Monday, the president posted to Truth Social:</p> <p><iframe class=\"truthsocial-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0;\" src=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115684148454828379/embed\" width=\"600\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><script src=\"https://truthsocial.com/embed.js\" async=\"async\"></script></p> <p>But it's hard to see how an executive order banning states from passing AI laws would be constitutional.

    "full_content": "Their team lost.\n\nEight teen football players from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were arrested on theft charges in Florida after being caught in a brazen \"conspiracy\" to steal thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise from a Dick's Sporting Goods. The juvenile suspects had traveled to Polk County, Florida, to participate in the Prolifix Nationals tournament at the time of their apprehensions.\n\n\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) said in a press release that the incident occurred just hours before the teens were scheduled to participate in the championship game. They were handcuffed instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 10:55 am on December 6, a store manager at the Dick's Sporting Goods in Davenport contacted the sheriff's office \"after observing multiple juveniles concealing merchandise.\" PCSO deputies arrived on scene and detained all eight football players.According to authorities, the suspects split into two groups to carry out the conspiracy. Marcus Hudgens, 15, made a purchase near the front of the store and then approached his teammates, who were walking around inside. Hudgens opened his Dick's Sporting Goods bag, and the other suspects placed merchandise inside it.Daimon Johnson, 15, Mark Bryan, 15, and Ibn Mahdee Abdul Haqq, 14, then exited the store with the bag full of stolen merchandise. They were arrested upon exit. Abdul-Haqq allegedly had stolen merchandise concealed inside a black backpack, while Bryan was in possession of the bag from the store that consisted of more than $2,000 worth of stolen goods. The other five suspects were detained inside the store. This included Hudgens, Elijah Myers, 14, Tymir Speller, 15, Tymir Smith, 14, and Jacob Scott, 15. Authorities discovered a beanie hidden inside Speller's pants when he was detained, according to the press release.Photo Polk County Sheriff's OfficeThe eight teens were identified as members of the United Thoroughbreds, a youth football team located in Philadelphia. The total value of stolen merchandise totaled $2,296.07.\"These juveniles were not from Polk County, they came here from Philly for a football tournament, and instead of representing their team with pride, they chose to steal - they are Thoroughbred thieves,\" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who shamed the players in a press conference. \"Let this be clear: it doesn't matter if you're from here or visiting, if you break the law in Polk County, you will be arrested and held accountable.\"The team's coach, Raekwon Bynes, 29, responded to the store and confirmed to authorities that the teens were staying in Davenport for the championship game, the sheriff's office said. The eight suspects had no prior criminal histories and declined to provide statements to authorities. The players were transported to the Juvenile Assessment Center, and each was charged with retail theft and conspiracy to commit retail theft.Sheriff Judd congratulated the opposing team for defeating the Thoroughbreds in the championship game, stating that the Coco Tigers didn't just win but \"ran over them.\" The Thoroughbreds lost the game 26-6.",

    "full_content": "\"Switching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department\u2019s official correspondence.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has directed diplomats to ditch the font used by the Biden administration and return to the Times New Roman typeface for official communications.\n\nIn an \"Action Request\" memo obtained by the New York Times, Rubio said that switching back to the font would \"restore decorum and professionalism to the department\u2019s written work.\" The memo stated that Calibri, which Biden administration Secretary of State Antony Blinken ordered the switch to in 2023, was \"informal\" compared to serif typefaces such as Times New Roman, and \"clashes\" with the department\u2019s letterhead. The document\u2019s authenticity was confirmed by a State Department official.\n\nThe memo, bearing the subject line \"Return to Tradition: Times New Roman 14-Point Font Required for All Department Paper,\" said that the change to Calibri \"was not among the department\u2019s most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful instances of DEIA,\" the acronym for diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. Rubio said the switch was a failure, and that \"accessibility-based document remediation cases\" had not declined.\n\nRubio wrote, \"Switching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department\u2019s official correspondence.\" Times New Roman, Rubio wrote, had been the official typeface of the department for nearly 20 years. Prior to 2004, the State Department used Courier New.\n\nBlinken changed the font in 2023 after a recommendation came from the State Department\u2019s office of diversity and inclusion. The switch to Calibri, which is viewed as a more modern, accessible font, was meant to improve readability for those with vision problems, dyslexia, and those who use assistive technology such as screen readers.\n\nRubio\u2019s order said that Serif typefaces, such as Times New Roman, are \"generally perceived to connote tradition, formality and ceremony,\" and used by other federal government entities such as the White House and Supreme Court.",

The lawsuits focus on the fact that the department\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/20-states-push-back-as-ed-dept-hands-programs-to-other-agencies/2025/12\">signed seven agreements</a>\u00a0with four other federal agencies, allowing those agencies to handle the day-to-day management of key grant programs. Under these arrangements, the Labor Department now heads up most K-12 grant programs, distributing over $20 billion annually to schools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The National Education Association issued a ridiculous\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/trump-administration-robs-students-educational-opportunity-announcement-dismantle-department\">statement</a>\u00a0alleging that the moves are \u201cillegal, cruel, and shameful.\u201d </strong>NEA president Becky Pringle bizarrely declared, \u201cNot only do they want to starve and steal from our students\u2014they want to rob them of their futures. Nothing is more important than the success of our students, and America\u2019s educators and parents will not be silent as Trump and Linda McMahon turn their backs on our students, families, and communities to pay for billionaire tax cuts.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>American Federation of Teachers President<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/randi-weingarten-sounds-alarm-about-trump-moving-eliminate-education-dept-not-legal\">\u00a0Randi Weingarten</a>\u00a0also claims that the move is not legal. \u201cThere are lots of things about the Department of Education that are in statute,\u201d she declares, referring to funds that the department distributes to low-income families, students with disabilities, English as a Second Language learners, and work-study programs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s take a deep breath, step back, and look at the facts.</strong></p>\n\n<p>While the federal government has spent money on education and developed education policies since the 19th century, the DOE didn\u2019t become a standalone agency until 1980, when it split off from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Its creation came about when, as a sop to the National Education Association,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.the74million.org/article/analysis-the-us-department-of-education-born-in-the-nea/\">Jimmy Carter</a>\u00a0established it while running for reelection. Clearly, it was politically motivated, and in response, the NEA subsequently issued its first-ever\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/edcast/25/02/unpacking-us-department-education-what-does-it-actually-do\">endorsement</a>\u00a0in a presidential contest.</p>\n\n<p>As\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/710-wor-560450/3866153621455-what-does-trump-s-class-dismissed-mean-for-the-department-of-education\">Jay Greene</a>, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, points out, most of the programs that the DOE now administers were created before the department was established. He writes that it is \u201cjust a bureaucratic restructuring. It doesn\u2019t get rid of programs; it doesn\u2019t cut funding; it doesn\u2019t close any schools. It\u2019s just a change in the administration, not a change in the programs and services and funding delivered to America\u2019s schools.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://donnagarner.org/2-11-25-a-detailed-blueprint-to-shut-down-the-u-s-dept-of-education-by-u-s-parents-involved-in-education-uspie/\">Neal McCluskey</a>, director of the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Educational Freedom, further explains that under the restructuring, states may get money back, but with strings attached.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additionally,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.k12dive.com/news/trump-issues-march-2025-executive-order-gut-close-education-department/741790/\">President Trump</a>\u00a0says his goal is to transfer the department\u2019s primary responsibilities\u2014such as Pell Grants, Title I funding, and resources for students with disabilities\u2014to other parts of the federal government.</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is little reason to believe that moving various programs to different agencies will have any impact on schools whatsoever. Running the same programs under a different department is unlikely to affect students.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cIf that\u2019s all they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re not going to save any money, they\u2019re not going to change any policy,\u201d </strong></em>says\u00a0<a href=\"https://cbnewsletters.chalkbeat.org/p/why-trump-s-effort-to-dismantle-the-education-department-matters-very-little-and-also-quite-a-lot\">Shep Melnick</a>, a political scientist at Boston College.</p>\n\n<p>Melnick is correct. Essentially, what the feds are trying to do at this time is tantamount to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.</p>\n\n<p>What the left and the teachers\u2019 unions truly fear is that the restructuring will eventually result in the federal government completely withdrawing all educational control.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The reasons for shutting it down are numerous. </strong></p>\n\n<p>First, spending is more efficient when it is closer to the source.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-the-u-s-department-of-education-could-be-dismantled-this-is-good-news/2025/06\">Jim Blew</a>, assistant secretary of education during the first Trump administration and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, correctly notes, \u201cThis \u2018local control\u2019 message is often met by naysayers with the concern that some local districts may do worse without federal \u2018guardrails\u2019\u2014as if every school and district needs the same guardrails or that maintaining them comes with no cost. Perhaps some local districts will use their freedom to create worse outcomes (although that would be hard to do when roughly a third of our nation\u2019s 4th and 8th graders already cannot demonstrate even basic, grade-level reading or math skills), but I find it more likely that we will see committed, innovative educators improve student outcomes when freed to use federal funding as they think best.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps no one fully comprehends the DOE\u2019s uselessness and waste more than former Secretary of Education\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/betsy-devos-shut-down-the-department-of-education-trump-elon\">Betsy DeVos</a>. She contends that it shuffles money around, imposes unnecessary requirements and political agendas through its grants, and then shirks responsibility for evaluating whether any of what it does actually adds value. \u201cHere\u2019s how it works: Congress appropriates funding for education; last year, it totaled nearly $80 billion. The department\u2019s bureaucrats take in those billions, add strings and red tape, peel off a percentage to pay for themselves, and then send it down to state education agencies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary, the DOE is ineffective, incompetent, unnecessary, and costly, and does nothing to support education. Its creation was a mistake, and it should be abolished. </strong>There is no strong policy reason or constitutional basis for the federal government to be involved in K-12 education. Ultimately, America\u2019s schools would be better off without it.</p>\n\n<p>But big-government leftists and teachers\u2019 unions rely on centralized authority. It\u2019s easier for them to influence a single federal agency where they already hold sway than to compete for control across 50 states and thousands of local districts.\u00a0 And, sadly, they will get their way, as 60 U.S. Senators would have to authorize the abolition of the DOE, which will not happen.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T00:50:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 19:50</span>\n",

You\u2019ve taken a major step in making sure you leave behind a legacy and that your assets are passed down as you see fit. But that, however, is not enough. There are plenty of potential mistakes that can torpedo your estate plan. That\u2019s why you need to mobilize now to make sure your estate plan is bullet proof.</p>\n<a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28453%29_0.jpg?itok=ALWbsxxm\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28453%29_0.jpg?itok=ALWbsxxm\"><picture><figure role=\"group\" class=\"caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images\"><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2cbd9b55-517d-44c3-92d7-6561249a2b98\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_80%28453%29_0.jpg?itok=ALWbsxxm\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption><em>Inside Creative House/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>\n\n<p>So let\u2019s take a look at some of the mistakes to look out for and how to fix them.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting to Update Your Estate Plan</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Your estate plan is a living mechanism. And things change in life. Divorces happen. Falling outs happen. Loved ones pass away. New kids are born, and so on. These major life events could affect the sturdiness of your estate plan. So you need to go back in there and make the necessary changes to make sure the estate plan still adheres to your wishes.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting to Manage Beneficiaries </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Designated beneficiaries overpower what\u2019s in a will or trust. So you need to make sure you still have the right beneficiaries listed on accounts like retirement plans.</p>\n\n<p>You may have listed your spouse as the designated beneficiary to your individual retirement account (IRA), and recently went through a divorce. In this case, you may want to update the beneficiary designation.</p>\n\n<p>Or, perhaps, a designated beneficiary has passed away. With that said, many experts recommend you name more than one beneficiary.</p>\n\n<p>And to keep everything in line, here\u2019s a list of common accounts that take beneficiary listings:</p>\n\n<ul><li>insurance policies</li>\n\t<li>401(k)</li>\n\t<li>Roth 401(k)</li>\n\t<li>IRA</li>\n\t<li>Roth IRA</li>\n\t<li>brokerage accounts</li>\n\t<li>savings accounts</li>\n</ul><p>In addition, it\u2019s always important to pay close attention to how the beneficiary themselves could affect your estate plan.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Designating a Minor as a Beneficiary </strong></h2>\n\n<p>You want your children to be financially taken care of after you pass away. So naming them as beneficiaries to something like your retirement savings can seem like a no brainer.</p>\n\n<p>But that can open you up to some pitfalls. Minors can\u2019t manage large amounts of assets. In most cases, a court will have to appoint a conservator to manage the assets. And this individual may not be the person you would want to have managed your child\u2019s inheritance. In addition, the minor would take full control of the assets once they reach the age of majority (18 or 21, depending on the state). At this point, your child may or may not be capable of handling the money responsibly.</p>\n\n<p>You could bypass these issues by creating a trust and naming your child as the beneficiary. A trustee of your choice would manage the assets. And you can choose when the funds may be distributed. This could hinge on specific circumstances like once your child graduates college or holds a steady job.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Improperly Funding a Trust </strong></h2>\n\n<p>A trust is an essential part of any estate plan. Not only does it allow your assets to bypass probate but it also ensures assets are properly distributed as you wish. It\u2019s a legal entity that holds and manages these assets.</p>\n\n<p>But unless it\u2019s properly funded, it\u2019s nothing more than an empty vessel. To avoid this, you need to start by drafting your legal trust document. And you need to list all your assets by type and value. For example, you can have real estate, vehicles, bank accounts, and brokerage accounts. You also need to gather all the paperwork that proves your ownership to these assets such as financial documents, deeds, and titles. Next, open an official trust account through a financial institution. You then fund your trust by making title changes and naming the trust as the beneficiary on applicable accounts.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting About Your Digital Assets </strong></h2>\n\n<p>With so much time we spend online, we may forget we are creating virtual assets. You create an identity and share pictures of precious memories on social media. You may have a substantial amount of money in cryptocurrency. You may run a business entirely online.</p>\n\n<p>So your estate plan needs to take into account what happens to these assets after you die. So creating a digital estate plan is key.</p>\n\n<p>Start by taking inventory of your digital assets like social media profiles, emails, intellectual property, important computer files, digital media, and more. And as you would choose an executor for your estate plan, you should choose one for your digital estate plan as well. It can be the same person.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, you may want to provide access to these digital assets by using a reliable password manager and giving your trustee access. Plus, make sure you have a detailed digital estate plan document outlining exactly how you want your digital assets managed.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Failing to Prepare for Incapacitation</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Nobody wants to think about it\u2014but anything can happen in life. And you could become incapacitated and unable to make important decisions regarding your assets and health.</p>\n\n<p>You can avoid this by setting up a financial and health care power of attorney. These are people you trust who can step in to make important financial and health-related decisions in the unfortunate event that you become incapacitated.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting About Taxes </strong></h2>\n\n<p>The federal estate tax can take a bite out of your estate before it\u2019s distributed to your heirs. Luckily, this tax would only impact significantly large estates.</p>\n\n<p>For 2025, the estate tax is only levied on transferable assets valued at more than $13.99 million or $27.98 million for married couples. That is the current federal estate and gift tax exemption. For 2026, the federal estate and gift tax exemption rises to $15 million per person or $30 million per married couple.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting About Final Arrangements</strong></h2>\n\n<p>How would you like to spend your last days? In hospice? Assisted living? And when the time comes, how would you want to be remembered? Do you want to be buried or cremated? Do you want a memorial?</p>\n\n<p>All these are difficult questions. But you can save your loved ones some headaches by answering them now. You can clearly outline this in your estate plan so everything goes as you would like it to.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Bottom Line </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Drafting an estate plan is not enough. You need to continually update it. You may want to make beneficiary changes, for example. And you may have overlooked other factors, too. For example, you may want to make sure you have a digital estate plan in place. And you also want to make sure your trust is properly funded. And, importantly, you need to take a look at any tax implications. In any case, it\u2019s a good idea to review your estate plan with a trusted estate planning attorney.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T00:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 19:00</span>\n",

Jasmine Crockett to jump into the Senate Democratic primary in Texas, believing she will be the easiest opponent to beat.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>With Sen. John Cornyn facing a tough three-way primary and Democrats fielding two strong candidates, Republican strategists reportedly were concerned the race would be tougher than expected. They feared a draining fight could leave the nominee wounded before the real battle against the Democrats even began.</p>\n\n<p>Back in July, the NRSC commissioned a private poll that \u201cby design\u201d included Crockett\u2019s name among the Democratic contenders. <strong>Her numbers surprised everyone: she topped the field. Instead of treating it as an internal curiosity, GOP operatives moved fast.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen we saw the results, we were like, \u2018OK, we got to disseminate this far and wide,\u2019\u201d a source told NOTUS.</p>\n\n<p>In June news broke that Texas Democrats Colin Allred, James Talarico, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Rep. Joaquin Castro met to discuss the 2026 election.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Operatives at the NRSC realized that Crockett \u2014 whose political stock had been rising \u2014 wasn\u2019t included in that meeting and also hadn\u2019t been included in any credible poll. So they decided to change that.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following the NRSC\u2019s polls, other surveys began to include Crockett and showed similar results: She was surging in the primary.</p>\n\n<p>The NRSC then worked to amplify those polls and is taking credit for helping \u201corchestrate the pile on of these polling numbers to really drive that news cycle and that narrative that Jasmine Crockett was surging in Texas,\u201d the source said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And Crockett took the bait.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe more I saw the poll results, I couldn\u2019t ignore the trends that were clear,\u201d she said later, tying her Senate bid directly to the polling wave Republicans had manufactured for her. It was the political equivalent of bait left in plain sight. And she took it.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Behind the curtain, the NRSC operatives had built an entire ecosystem to sustain their creation. </strong>The source called it an \u201cAstroTurf recruitment process,\u201d as the NRSC had allies who were \u201cseeding these new polls pretty aggressively into progressive digital spaces.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They even coordinated text messages and phone calls to Democratic activists, urging them to call Crockett\u2019s office and push her to run. <strong>Each round of organized \u201cencouragement\u201d added to the illusion of an organic movement. A small feedback loop spun into a statewide phenomenon.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, internal GOP numbers showed Cornyn trailing Attorney General Ken Paxton badly in a three-way primary that also included Wesley Hunt. Paxton polled as a general-election liability; Hunt wasn\u2019t ready for a statewide fight. The GOP couldn\u2019t afford to risk a damaged nominee in a cycle where Democrats had real contenders in Allred and Talarico. So national Republicans recalibrated. If their incumbent had vulnerabilities, they could balance the math by softening up the other side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That meant turning Jasmine Crockett\u2014a loud, anti-Trump social-media darling with a taste for cable brawls\u2014into the presumptive Democratic frontrunner. She was tailor-made for the part Republicans wanted cast: a polarizing progressive who would turn off swing voters in a Texas general election.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Then the miracle happened. Allred, once the strongest Democrat in the field,<a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2025/12/08/colin-allred-withdraws-senate-run-house/\"> suddenly exited the Senate race</a> to run for the House, effectively ceding the primary to Crockett. Crockett <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2025/12/07/jasmine-crockett-expected-to-launch-senate-campaign-ahead-of-candidate-filing-deadline/\">announced her campaign the same day</a>, citing the same polling trends the NRSC had seeded months earlier.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Crockett\u2019s campaign has admittedly gotten off to a rocky start. Her campaign launch video became an unintentional punchline, and despite her high profile and large campaign war chest, Senate Democrats<a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/12/09/senate-democrats-jasmine-crockett-decline-comment/\"> aren\u2019t lining up to endorse her</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But Republicans aren\u2019t done shoring her up. </strong></p>\n\n<p>They are actively exploring ways to sustain her momentum long enough to secure the Democratic nomination. That means quiet talks with outside conservative-aligned groups about launching \u201cindependent expenditure\u201d efforts that appear progressive on paper, with the sole purpose of propping up her campaign.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crockett frames her Senate run as destiny, powered by the people.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The irony is, those \u201cpeople\u201d were Republican operatives running call lists from D.C., testing whether they could turn raw data into a political force that worked in their favor. They could. And they did.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T23:35:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 18:35</span>\n",

James will argue that such letters are common and merely express how her office will interpret the law in these areas in light of questions from various boards.</p>\n\n<p>It states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cBoard members may be removed by the commissioner of education if they, (1) violate the education law or another law \u2018pertaining to [public] schools,\u2019 including the state Human Rights Law; (2) willfully neglect their duties as public officers; or (3) willfully disobey a \u2018decision, order, rule or regulation\u2019 of the Regents or the commissioner of education.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>The question is whether a court will find the letter itself insufficient to trigger a lawsuit, rather than waiting to see how that legal guidance is applied in any given case.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Putting aside the merits of the legal cause of action, the letter should raise free speech concerns. It seems designed to intimidate some who want to raise these policies while giving others support for shutting down debates. Polls show that the public is generally opposed to transgender policies on pronouns, sports, and bathroom access.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The letter emphasizes that free speech can be limited at these meetings:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201c[u]nder the First Amendment, school board meetings are considered limited public fora. This means that school boards that allow public comment \u2018may make reasonable, view-neutral rules governing the content of speech allowed,\u2019 including prohibiting all comments on a particular topic that would have discriminatory, harassing, or bullying effects.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>James leaves the scope of what would be considered \u201cdiscriminatory, harassing, or bullying effects\u201d lingering without any clear definition. <strong>It is the same vagueness in standards that we have seen used in higher education where administrators have succeeded in getting students to self-censor to avoid the unknown lines of speech regulation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In other words, the letter is giving these boards guidance on how to stop public debate in their meetings on issues that are currently unpopular and leading to rising opposition among parents and students.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The timing of the letter before the midterm elections only magnifies suspicions that James is nudging boards to prohibit all comments on these divisive issues.</strong></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T23:10:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 18:10</span>\n",

The years, as I like to say, gradually teach things the days don\u2019t notice.</p>\n\n<p>Such context cannot be downloaded, transferred or absorbed through an AI tool, which, by its very title, can never be a genuine substitute for earned (and therefore, actual) intelligence.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Gaining Perspective</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Having traversed years of complex market forces, themes and instruments (from\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/gold-vs-an-openly-rigged-failing-financial-system\"><strong>derivative timebombs</strong></a><strong>\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/making-sense-of-comex-insanity\"><strong>COMEX tricks</strong></a>\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/banking-risk-the-real-killer-virus\"><strong>banking risks</strong></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/open-madness-in-global-bond-markets-got-gold\"><strong>bond market signals</strong></a>), I, like many others, have acquired certain, well, Jaded perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>This, of course, also includes biases, of which I am no less guilty.</p>\n\n<p>Experience nevertheless allows for recognizing occasional lighthouses amidst the otherwise intentional fog of data overload, obfuscation, and noise. In short, and without crystal balls or a genius IQ, we can endeavor to derive the simple from the complex, and then act upon that simplicity with a modest degree of understanding.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Patterns Repeating Themselves</strong></h2>\n\n<p>As we approach the end of 2025, we are seeing, yet again, certain familiar and simple patterns which can serve as potential lighthouses for those endeavoring to navigate so much admitted fog.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We all recognize, for example, debt levels screaming well beyond the Rubicon of the sustainable, resulting in further and familiar currency debasement, ripping (and predictable) gold prices, metals exchanges running out of metals, escalating geopolitical tensions and risk assets defying the gravity of fair valuation by literally every metric, from the Buffet and Shiller indicators to the NVDA market cap.</p>\n\n<p>And for years, we\u2019ve tracked these and countless other themes, both complex and simple, exciting and less exciting, together\u2014yet always free to make our own conclusions from the patterns, facts, numbers and themes presented.</p>\n\n<p>Below, I address two themes from 2025 which tell us much as we head toward a future riddled with increasing landmines as well as opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, I am referring to:\u00a0<strong>(1)</strong>\u00a0insider stock selling and\u00a0<strong>(2)</strong>\u00a0a potential revaluation plan hiding beneath the Strategic BTC Reserve Order.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Insider Selling: The Rats Leaving a Sinking Ship</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Although an ardent capitalist, I have, over the years, been critical of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/dying-capitalism-the-new-feudalism\"><strong>neo-feudalism</strong></a>\u00a0which has\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/the-death-of-capitalism\"><strong>replaced free-market capitalism</strong></a>\u00a0in what I have critiqued as an unhealthy and rigged-to-fail game of insider lords and Main Street serfs.</p>\n\n<p>The lords of finance and politics have long ago accepted that it was better to \u201cbe inside\u201d than to do the \u201cright thing\u201d when it came to monopoly powers, fractional reserve banking, asset-bubble creation, the repeal of Glass Steagall, the deregulation of derivatives, stock buy-backs or appalling management/employee salary ratios, all of which objectively defy greed and creep toward pathology.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Such laws of markets and human nature will likely never change, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t prepare ourselves for the consequences of this gamed system.</p>\n\n<p>What many have not noticed from 2024 to now, however, is the astronomical level of insider selling of publicly traded stocks.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Massive Selling</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Beginning in 2024, for example, Jeffrey Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Jamie Dimon, and the Walton family, along with numerous other C-suite denizens, have individually and collectively been selling billions worth of their own shares at the top of a market they knew was grotesquely over-valued and heading straight for a recession.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the $464B of insider selling in 2024, which continued well into 2025, was the highest level of insider dumping ever seen, save for the $650B of similar dumping in 2007, a year before the Great Financial Crisis sent the global financial system to its knees in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>This (and not \u201cestate planning,\u201d \u201cphilanthropy\u201d or \u201cdiversification\u201d) was why a banking CEO like Jamie Dimon, otherwise a vocal proponent of long-term holdings yet intimately aware of defaulting loan and consumer credit signals, was selling $150M worth of his own Morgan Chase stock for the first time in 18 years.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>And Bezos dumping $13B worth of his Amazon shares or Ellison taking $3B off his Oracle account while Zuckerberg cashed in a 2024 personal Meta stake of $50B came from the same motives and knowledge of the NVDA insiders who were simultaneously dumping their shares at record levels and all-time-high valuations.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This was not diversification or coincidental profit taking; it was shared recognition that their valuations, priced to perfection, were heading toward a crisis.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2><strong>History Rhyming</strong></h2>\n\n<p>This, of course, is a familiar playbook. From Countrywide Mortgage to Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, we saw similar insider dumping in 2007\u2014and it always came\u00a0<em>before</em>\u00a0rather than\u00a0<em>after</em>\u00a0they tanked.</p>\n\n<p>The sell-offs quietly marking 2024 and continuing into 2025 are, at least to me, a signal that the rats are jumping ship months before the market bow dips beneath the equity waterline.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s even more telling is that the sell-to-buy ratios behind these insider sales had skyrocketed to ratios of 9:1 and even 12:1 in 2024, the highest in history, against an average healthy rate of 3:1.</p>\n\n<p><em>Do you see a sell signal?</em></p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Emergency Plan Hiding in Plain Sight?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>2025 was also year of headline-making executive orders promoted to make America great again.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of one\u2019s politics, however, we can all agree that when the interest expense on America\u2019s public debt exceeds $1.2T (well above its annual military budget), there\u2019s a giant and economy-crushing elephant in the room.</p>\n\n<p>As I\u2019ve warned from the writings of\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/the-philosophy-of-debt-the-math-of-precious-metals\"><strong>18th-century mathematicians</strong></a>\u00a0to 21st-century Debt/GDP ratios, there\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYXmAJsdEAQ\"><strong>no longer an easy solution</strong></a>\u00a0to such historically unprecedented debt and hence currency traps.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we\u2019ve reached the desperation stage.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the evidence of\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/brics-vs-trump-whose-the-real-sucker\"><strong>a world steadily turning away from the USD</strong></a>\u00a0and toward physical gold as a superior strategic reserve asset is not a theory but a fact, one confirmed from the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/comex-flows-is-the-gold-case-almost-too-obvious\"><strong>COMEX</strong></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/the-brics-wont-kill-the-dollar-us-policy-will\"><strong>BRICS</strong></a>\u00a0to the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/latest-treasury-fed-and-bis-reports-confirm-all-twisted-paths-lead-to-gold\"><strong>BIS</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>In this backdrop of such largely ignored yet empirically mathematical realism, came a flurry of executive orders to keep the headlines positive while the experts scurried for alleged solutions. But was there a deeper \u201cplan\u201d behind all this?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Is Something Hiding Within the Strategic Reserve BTC Order?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>One so-called solution, of course, was the March 2025 Strategic BTC Reserve Order, intended to be codified by a subsequent Act of Congress. Like all desperate legislation in the face of an objective debt crisis, this gold play, carefully hiding under a BTC mask, showed its sunny side and \u201cdigital future\u201d to the media while hiding a darker side (of centralized control) in carefully worded sabotage.</p>\n\n<p>Tucked, for example, within the language of this and other so-called odes to a \u201cdecentralized future of digital efficiency\u201d and \u201cdigital gold\u201d was a provision which hid the hints of a planned and centralized currency debasement. This hidden skunk in the woodpile is now waiting for an inevitable \u201cuh-oh\u201d moment to trigger it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the crypto language of 2025 contains a lot of talk regarding \u201cstrategic reserve assets,\u201d which, of course, referred to BTC, but which some feel was just a cover story. But if you dig deeper into this definition within the Federal Reserve Register,\u00a0<em>\u201cstrategic reserve assets\u201d</em>\u00a0do not explicitly include\u00a0<em>\u201cmonetary metals\u201d</em>\u00a0\u2013 i.e., gold and silver.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In fact, under US law and Fed regulations, there is no statutory or regulatory definition of \u201cstrategic reserve assets\u201d that covers metals, BTC or any other assets in a general sense.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Fed, does, however, publish policy guidance on the composition of FX reserves and the gold holdings within the Treasury\u2019s \u201cExchange Stabilization Fund\u201d \u2013 a veritable \u201cslush fund\u201d created by the profits FDR made from his $2.8B gold confiscation of citizen metals/wealth in 1933\u2026</p>\n\n<p>This is no coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>Unbeknownst to most, the powers floating around all this crypto legislation allows the Treasury Department to acquire, manage and value these reserve assets for \u201cnational security.\u201d This is clever legalese for: The government, subsequent to altering official statements, can, at its discretion, later devalue, re-value and/or acquire these assets whenever the $#!7 hits the next fan\u2026</p>\n\n<h2><strong>We\u2019ve Seen This Movie Before</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In case you think such a tin-foil-hatted suggestion smacks in the face of American freedoms, please know that such a playbook for emergency gold re-valuation and dollar-debasement is nothing new at all.</p>\n\n<p>In 1933, when FDR faced a debt crisis of \u201cnational security\u201d (due, of course, to the banking and leverage practices of the roaring 20\u2019s), he was able by executive order (6102) to not only confiscate citizen gold at the $20.00 market price, but 9 months later, having taken his citizens\u2019 gold, to then reset the price higher at $35.00/ounce. He then placed the billions he \u201cacquired\u201d into the same ESF \u201cslush fund\u201d still at play today.</p>\n\n<p>Overnight, your government thus devalued the dollar by 69%, which made it easier to pay down Uncle Sam\u2019s debt after robbing the gold and debasing the dollar by which its citizens measured their wealth.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Concerns\u2026</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Such clever yet complex legislative theft, of course, was no shocker. All debtors, including Uncle Sam, prefer a debased currency to pay down fixed debt.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I have some concerns that the same playbook of 1933 is now quietly in motion today, only the debt levels are much higher and the potential debasement to come would be much harsher for Joe Six-Pack.</p>\n\n<p>Why the concern? Because desperate governments have shown their true faces before, and they are more desperate today than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>Uncle Sam, for example, knows that he is approaching $40T of public debt, which no one in the world, including the White House, believes can ever be repaid\u2014at least not unless he finds some equity real fast. This is because more Fed money printing is becoming politically embarrassing and globally distrusted, as gold is now held by more central banks than USTs.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Hidden Piggy Bank</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Currently, and conveniently, the US sits on over 260 million ounces of gold reserves whose certificates have been priced at $42.22/oz since 1973, creating a current value of $11B, which we all know is peanuts when measured against trillion-dollar debt levels.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, we should at least be concerned of a move to one day re-value those certificates higher, much higher, to give Uncle Sam some needed cash.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>But rather than just reprice those certificates to the market price for a trillion or so of fast cash (also peanuts), it\u2019s possible that the Fed, in conjunction with the US Treasury, would reprice those certificates much higher, as they did in 1933.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, and thanks to the hidden language above, they could legally reprice gold at $20,000, a deliberate number which would revalue those gold certificates from $11B to $5.2T, which is closer to the valuation needed to stabilize (i.e. match the assets and liabilities) of the USA\u2019s most liquid M0 monetary base (cash + bank reserves at the Fed) of $6.7T.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What\u2019s Good for Government is Bad for the Governed\u00a0</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In other words, and by one emergency action taken in a moment of \u201cnational security\u201d (i.e., an act of war, rate spikes or market implosion), the US could unilaterally re-establish a shadow \u201cgold standard light\u201d on its M0 monetary base.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Such an \u201cemergency measure\u201d would restore faith in Uncle Sam\u2019s otherwise unloved Treasury bonds without having to \u201cprint\u201d a single dollar at the Fed nor issue a single IOU from the Treasury. It\u2019s basically \u201cgolden QE.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But as in 1933, that same emergency measure would mean an absolutely disastrous devaluation of the USD by 80%. Such debasement would hit the man (and savers) on the street square in the gut, while rescuing the government at their expense.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Shocking? Unthinkable? Koo-Koo? Well, we\u2019ve seen this movie and playbook before, less than a century ago\u2014it\u2019s just that so few read history\u2026</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Insiders Building Their Arcs Before the Rain</strong></h2>\n\n<p>As in 1933, the current government and the commercial banks aligned with it would need to hold this physical gold\u00a0<em>before</em>\u00a0it was repriced.\u00a0In my admittedly jaded mind, hints of this were signaled (and prepared) three years ago when the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/gold-basel-iii-trillion-dollar-question\"><strong>Basel III rules</strong></a>\u00a0conveniently classified allocated, physical gold with Tier-1 asset status.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This made gold equal to risk-free money\u00a0<em>prior</em>\u00a0to the uh-oh moment (of \u201cnational security\u201d) they know is coming. The BIS was effectively helping itself and the banking system build their Arc of PHYSICAL GOLD before the flood of deliberate dollar debasement under a gold revaluation plan.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Real Gold Matters More than Ever</strong></h2>\n\n<p>If this \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d is true or at least plausible, it serves as yet another obvious reason to never \u201cown\u201d gold in an ETF or futures contract. As we have\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/how-to-own-gold-avoid-gold-etfs?_gl=1*1bka0f9*_gcl_au*Mjk5MjMwMTI3LjE3NjQxODA1NzE.*_ga*NzM3MTgxMjE4LjE3MTU1OTQzODA.*_ga_TNF8BYCM09*czE3NjQ3ODg5MjMkbzUzJGcxJHQxNzY0Nzg5ODk2JGozMyRsMCRoMTUwOTAzNDY2OA..\"><strong>warned for years</strong></a>, such holdings are not gold ownership but a mere claim on gold.</p>\n\n<p>And as for future contracts and other levered instruments of legalized price fixing on the openly wounded COMEX, we already know that the leverage on those permanent gold and silver shorts is multiples beyond the metals actually available.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The gold (and silver) just ain\u2019t there\u2026</p>\n\n<p><em><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2853%29_8.jpg?itok=HTn-r_T1\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image%20%2853%29_8.jpg?itok=HTn-r_T1\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"cebdcc14-98b5-4a70-9972-ffc0b3594d2a\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image%20%2853%29_8.jpg?itok=HTn-r_T1\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></em></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Banking Tricks vs. Tricked Gold</strong></h2>\n\n<p>If gold were suddenly re-priced well beyond the market price, the short-squeeze to follow would be fatal to such discredited exchanges.\u00a0In such an event, the market would immediately go \u201cno offer,\u201d which means the exchanges, ETFs, and even commercial banks holding client gold would exercise their\u00a0<em>force majeure</em>\u00a0clauses, also hiding in plain sight.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This means they could settle your gold \u201cclaims\u201d and contracts at the last official settlement price, depriving you of any upside in such an emergency repricing of gold. Those\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/thinking-of-bank-stored-gold-think-again\"><strong>holding their gold at banks</strong></a><strong>\u00a0</strong>could thus wake up to realize that they\u2019ve been paying storage fees for an asset whose sudden price appreciation would be denied them.</p>\n\n<p>Gold held in so-called \u201csafe deposit boxes\u201d would be equally at risk.\u00a0 As we also learned from the 90-year playbook of the last great taking/moment of \u201cnational security,\u201d anyone seeking access to their safe deposit boxes required the presence of a federal agent to legally \u201cacquire\u201d their gold as a matter of sovereign necessity.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Jurisdiction Matters</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Given the above reasons and risks, we have consistently recommended that US investors create a legal firewall between their precious metals and sovereign governments. This is not because we KNOW a great taking WILL happen, but because we know it CAN happen.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGold hub\u201d jurisdictions like Switzerland and Singapore, wherein gold is a uniquely protected asset, have therefore been an equal, essential and deliberate part of this preparation and conviction.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Again, I cannot say the above revaluation will happen, only that it could happen. As such, it is better to be prepared and informed than re-valued, robbed or surprised. Either way, physical gold, properly owned and protected, prevails over melting currencies and desperate/broke sovereigns.</strong></em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T22:20:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 17:20</span>\n",

And unlike the Fed, this one was not nearly as good for risk assets: the company reported earnings which beat estimates, but the top line was a mess, with cloud growth missing across the board, and margins also disappointing, sending the stock lower after hours.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Here is what Oracle just reported for Q2:</em></p>\n\n<ul><li>Adjusted EPS $2.26 vs. $1.47 y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates of $1.64\n\n\t<ul><li>The company clarified that GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share \"were both positively impacted by a $2.7 billion pre-tax gain in the sale of Oracle's interest in our Ampere chip company.\"</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Adjusted revenue $16.06 billion, +14% y/y, <strong>missing </strong>estimates of $16.21 billion\n\t<ul><li>Cloud revenue (IaaS plus SaaS) $8.0 billion, +36% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate $8.04 billion</li>\n\t\t<li>Cloud Infrastructure revenue (IaaS) $4.1 billion, +71% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates of $4.09 billion</li>\n\t\t<li>Cloud Application revenue (SaaS) $3.9 billion, +11% y/y, <em><strong>matching </strong></em>estimates of $3.9 billion</li>\n\t\t<li>Software revenue $5.88 billion, -3.1% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimates of $6.03 billion</li>\n\t\t<li>Hardware revenue $776 million, +6.6% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates of $716.7 million</li>\n\t\t<li>Service revenue $1.43 billion, +7.4% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates of $1.36 billion<br />\n\t\t\u00a0</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Revenue in constant currency +13%, <strong>missing </strong>estimates of +14.6%\n\t<ul><li>Cloud revenue (IaaS plus SaaS) in constant currency +33%, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +35.1%</li>\n\t\t<li>Cloud Infrastructure revenue (IaaS) in constant currency +66%, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +69.1%</li>\n\t\t<li>Cloud Application revenue (SaaS) in constant currency +11%, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +12.4%<br />\n\t\t\u00a0</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Adjusted operating income $6.72 billion, +10% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates $6.82 billion</li>\n\t<li>Adjusted operating margin 42% vs. 43% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimates of 42.2%</li>\n\t<li>Remaining performance obligations $523 billion, <em><strong>up 15% and beating </strong></em>est of $519.4BN\u00a0</li>\n</ul><p>Commenting on the quarter, Larry Ellison said that \"we are now committed to a policy of chip neutrality where we work closely with all our CPU and GPU suppliers. Of course, we will continue to buy the latest GPUs from NVIDIA, but we need to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy,\u201d said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. The question, of course, is where will the money come from for the company which has spooked the stock - and especially bond market - with its CDS soaring to the highest since the GFC, as markets realized that ORCL will need to issue a lot more debt to fund its capex.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Ellison also said that \u201cOracle sold Ampere because we no longer think it is strategic for us to continue designing, manufacturing and using our own chips in our cloud datacenters.\"</p>\n\n<p>There was the token AI pitch of course: \"There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) increased by $68 billion in Q2\u2014up 15% sequentially to $523 billion\u2014highlighted by new commitments from Meta, NVIDIA, and others,\" said Oracle Principal Financial Officer, Doug Kehring.</p>\n\n<p>So what to make of these results? Well, as we noted in our preview, while three months ago, Oracle\u2019s scorching earnings outlook sent the shares soaring to their best day in three decades, today things look very different for the database software maker and the AI trade in general.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Heading into today's earnings report, ORCL shares plunged 33%\u00a0since Sept. 10 (and more than 40% at the lows), when they hit an all-time high based on enthusiasm for raging growth in its cloud business. Today, Oracle and many other artificial intelligence companies are facing a wave of skepticism due to heavy capital expenditures and the circular nature of some arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>Today's results were mixed at best: yes earnings beat, but Oracle posted disappointing cloud revenue, signaling it will take longer than expected for the company\u2019s recent huge AI bookings to pay off.\u00a0 As noted above, Q2 cloud sales increased 34% to $7.98 billion, while revenue in the company\u2019s closely watched infrastructure business increased 68% to $4.08 billion. Both numbers fell just short of analysts estimates.</p>\n\n<p>The silver lining: Oracle's remaining performance obligation, a measure of bookings, jumped to $523 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended Nov. 30, the company said Wednesday in a\u00a0statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $519 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, ORCL needs to start monetizing this backlog instead of just parading with how much it may collect at some point in the future.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Oracle has found recent success in the competitive cloud computing market. It\u2019s engaging in a massive data center build-out to power AI work for\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0and also counts companies such as ByteDance\u2019s TikTok and\u00a0Meta Platforms as major cloud customers.</p>\n\n<p>Still, as Bloomberg notes, Wall Street has raised doubts about the costs and time lines required to develop AI infrastructure at such a massive scale. Oracle has taken out massive sums of debt and committed to leasing multiple data center sites; its off-balance sheet debt is also emerging as a potential risk.</p>\n\n<p>Investors want to see Oracle turn its higher spending on new data center infrastructure into revenue as quickly as it has promised. <strong>Capital expenditures, a metric of data center spending, were about $12 billion in the quarter, an increase from $8.5 billion in the preceding period</strong>. Analysts anticipated $8.25 billion in capital spending in the quarter.\u00a0\u00a0In September, the company projected capital expenditures of $35 billion for the fiscal year.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%20capex.jpg?itok=OhRMEA34\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%20capex.jpg?itok=OhRMEA34\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7adf0105-a021-4bd5-b535-21037f441b04\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"306\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ORCL%20capex.jpg?itok=OhRMEA34\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Part of the negative sentiment from investors in recent weeks is tied to increased skepticism about the business prospects of OpenAI, which is seeing more competition from companies like Google, wrote Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, in a note ahead of earnings. Investors would like to see Oracle management explain how they could adjust spending plans if demand from OpenAI changed, he added.</p>\n\n<p>But the biggest question, however, is the one we flagged earlier: where/when will the money to fund all this massive capex growth come from... and it better not be all debt because in that case the Barclays bear case of zero cash in late 2026 comes into play and ORCL's CDS will go straight up. The company better have a ready answer during the earnings call\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>ORCL shares slumped 6% in after hours after closing at $223.27 in New York.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%202025-12-10_13-24-48.jpg?itok=l-T0XlBH\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%202025-12-10_13-24-48.jpg?itok=l-T0XlBH\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"fe66086a-cfe1-4ef6-842a-590831c032de\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"294\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ORCL%202025-12-10_13-24-48.jpg?itok=l-T0XlBH\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T21:38:37+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 16:38</span>\n",

Only two days after India backpedaled on its plan to force smartphone makers to preinstall a state-run \u201ccybersecurity\u201d app, Reuters reports that the country is back at it. It\u2019s said to be considering a telecom industry proposal with another draconian requirement. This one would require smartphone makers to enable always-on satellite-based location tracking (Assisted GPS).</p>\n\n<p>The measure would require location services to remain on at all times, with no option to switch them off. The telecom industry also wants phone makers to disable notifications that alert users when their carriers have accessed their location. According to Reuters, India\u2019s home ministry was set to meet with smartphone industry executives on Friday, but the meeting was postponed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>#8</strong>\u00a0A journalist in the Netherlands has tested AI-powered glasses\u00a0<a href=\"https://x.com/pascal_bornet/status/1997215380423495938\">\u201cthat can instantly identify strangers on the street\u201d</a>\u2026</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Dutch journalist just tested a pair of AI-powered glasses that can instantly identify strangers on the street.</p>\n\n<p>No government database.

Now we need to see what Powell says for the full read\u201d</li>\n\t<li>25bp cut - still 1 cut in 2026 and 1 in 2027, as expected</li>\n\t<li>Statement language changed to 'in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments' as expected.</li>\n\t<li>Schmidt and Goolsbee hawkish dissents (in line - plus Miran for a larger cut, so 3 total)</li>\n\t<li>In the dot plot, have 6 hawkish dissents for next year \u2013 more than Goldman expected</li>\n\t<li>Fed have also announced resumption of purchases to keep balance sheet steady - <strong>they put that right in the statement</strong></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Mike Cahill, Macro FX Research at Goldman:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This all looks very close to GS expectations, so will come down to Powell's presentation in the press conference. I'm most interested in how he characterizes the debate on the Committee and risks to the labor market--what would it take for them to be ready to move again. Most notably to me in that context, they've kept their forecast for the Q4 unemployment rate average at 4.5%. That implies a much slower rate of increase than we've been seeing lately. The current rate is 4.44%, so this requires a little less than 5bp a month to meet the median. 7ppl expect it too move up to 4.6-4.7, which would be in line with the recent average. The GDP forecast for this year also implies they are penciling in a pretty big hit to growth in Q4 and a decent transfer into next year so a sizeable hit from the shutdown presumably.\u00a0On net, I would characterize that labor market forecast as optimistic rather than obviously hawkish, but it will depend on how much weaker it would need to be to get the Committee to reconsider that \"extent and timing\" of additional easing. I expect Powell will convey that the hurdle is relatively high given the 6 soft dissents already, but will see whether he brings up some of those risks more than he did in October.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Anna Wong,\u00a0Bloomberg Chief Economist:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe assess the overall tone of the statement and updated projections as leaning dovish \u2014 though there are some hawkish undertones. On the dovish side, the committee sharply revised up the growth trajectory while lowering the inflation outlook, and kept the dot plot unchanged. The FOMC also announced the commencement of reserve-management purchases. On the other hand, there\u2019s a signal in the policy statement that suggests the committee is inclined for an extended hold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Even though the dot plot shows just one 25-bp cut in 2026 \u2014 markets are pricing two \u2014 our view is that the Fed will end up cutting by 100 bps next year. </strong>That\u2019s because we anticipate weak payroll growth and currently see scant signs of an inflation resurgence in the first half of 2026.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Ira Jersey,\u00a0Bloomberg Rates Strategist </strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWhat the Federal Reserve seems to have forgotten is that reserve balances are either ample, or not. If the Fed wants to maintain an ample supply of reserves, I\u2019m still unsure why it isn\u2019t considering temporary open-market operations around tax days and other periods when reserve balances tend to fall as the TGA rises. Doing permanent operations is more difficult to explain to market participants, and although we understand the need for slow increases on the asset side of the balance sheet -- similar to, but larger than, pre-2007 operations -- we think using traditional repos to calibrate reserve demand would be a good way to right-size asset purchases.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Seema Shah, Principal Asset Management:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWith the recent scarcity of economic data and the wide dispersion in neutral rate estimates, it is hard to imagine any level of confidence in the economy that would lead to unanimous Fed voting.\u00a0We expect the Fed to pause and assess the lagged effects of prior tightening. While some additional easing is likely in 2026, it will probably be marginal and contingent on greater confidence\u2014and evidence\u2014regarding the health of the US economy.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank: </strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I'd want to ask Chair Powell if the committee has already internalized some of the weakness expected in next week\u2019s belated jobs data. I\u2019d like to get confirmation from the chair today.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Raphael Thuin, Tikehau Capital:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWith limited visibility on the data path, policymakers are forced to balance softening labor signals against the need to keep inflation moving lower. The result is greater policy uncertainty\u2014likely a key driver of market volatility as we approach 2026.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Jim Bianco, Bianco Research:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A big issue is that the US will have a new Fed chair next year. And the new chair may be perceived as having a political agenda. That\u2019s why I wanted to see more dissents to signal that they were ready, willing and able to be that political break. Maybe they will once we get that new Fed chairman but then that looks political that they didn\u2019t take the chance to do it before the new guy came.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Richard Flynn, Charles Schwab UK</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cBy acting pre-emptively, the Fed is signaling caution in the face of mounting downside risks, particularly as global growth remains sluggish and policy uncertainty persists. For investors, this is a measured adjustment rather than a dramatic pivot. While the cut could offer near-term support for risk assets, and potentially fuel a seasonal \u2018Santa rally\u2019, volatility is likely to remain elevated as markets assess the implications for future policy and the broader economic outlook.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Source: Bloomberg</em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T20:30:12+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 15:30</span>\n",

It is here, and it is seriously impacting the health of workers in Massachusetts,\" Emily H. Sparer-Fine, a director at DPH, said in a statement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health/michigan-man-dies-rabies-after-receiving-kidney-from-infected-donor-who-saved-kitten-from-skunk-cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>MICHIGAN MAN DIES OF RABIES AFTER RECEIVING KIDNEY FROM INFECTED DONOR WHO SAVED KITTEN FROM SKUNK: CDC</strong></a></p><p>The unnamed patient reportedly performed activities such as cutting, grinding and polishing, which can generate crystalline silica dust. When inhaled, this dust scars lung tissue and can <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead to silicosis</a>, DPH said.</p><p>The disease is preventable but irreversible and progressive, officials said. Symptoms include a persistent cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. Because there is often a long latency period between exposure and symptom onset, diagnoses are frequently delayed, according to DPH.\u00a0</p><p>As the disease progresses, it can result in serious complications, including lung cancer, tuberculosis and even death, the department added.\u00a0</p><p>Officials added that \"most cases of silicosis are work-related \u2013 it is very rare for silicosis to occur outside of workplace exposure.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cdc-reports-19th-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak-year-affecting-passengers-crew\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CDC REPORTS 19TH CRUISE SHIP NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK THIS YEAR AFFECTING PASSENGERS AND CREW</u></strong></a></p><p>Officials said the risk exists when handling natural stones, such as granite, but is especially high when working with engineered stone, such as quartz. While natural granite typically contains less than 45% silica, engineered stone can contain more than 90%, DPH reported.</p><p>\"In recent years, the disease has become more prevalent among stone fabrication workers due to the rise in popularity of countertops made from engineered stone (also known as quartz or artificial stone),\" DPH reported.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/botulism-deaths-raise-food-truck-safety-concerns-doctor-preaches-awareness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>BOTULISM DEATHS RAISE FOOD TRUCK SAFETY CONCERNS AS DOCTOR PREACHES 'AWARENESS'</u></strong></a></p><p>The department noted that, while this is the first confirmed case in Massachusetts within this industry, more cases are expected due to the disease's long latency period and the rising popularity of engineered stone.</p><p>Other states have also reported cases of silicosis. In a 2023 study, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">California researchers</a> identified 52 quartz countertop workers with silicosis. Twenty of them had advanced disease and 10 died.</p><p>Despite the disease\u2019s potential severity, there has not been an outright ban on <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/regulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quartz in U.S. kitchens</a>. By contrast, all work involving engineered stone has already been banned in Australia due to the severe risks it poses to workers. Other countries are also pushing for more regulations.</p><p>The DPH emphasizes that silicosis is \"absolutely preventable\" through proper workplace controls. The alert urges employers in the stone countertop fabrication industry to implement effective safety measures, such as wet cutting and proper ventilation, to minimize silica exposure and protect workers.</p><p>\"Silicosis is a devastating, life-altering disease and one that is also absolutely preventable,\" Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement.</p>",

He appeared in 16 games that year in what, until recently, marked his lone season with the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/indianapolis-colts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Indianapolis Colts.</a></p><p>Fast-forward five years, as a season-ending injury to Colts starter Daniel Jones prompted Rivers\u2019 former team to give him a call about the possibility of putting his retirement on pause.

I kind of thought that ship had sailed,\" said Rivers, who played 16 seasons for the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers before joining the Colts in 2020, and again, this week.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>\"But something about it excited me.

I know there\u2019s risk involved, but the only way to find out is going for it.\"</p><p>Rivers added that he happened to be watching the Colts game at the moment Jones fell to the turf. He admitted that it crossed his mind that he might eventually receive a call from Indianapolis coach Shane Steichen.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/colts-daniel-jones-slams-helmet-frustration-he-suffers-gruesome-achilles-injury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>COLTS' DANIEL JONES SLAMS HELMET IN FRUSTRATION AS HE SUFFERS GRUESOME ACHILLES INJURY</strong></a></p><p>\"When that happened, in my mind, I was like, \u2018What in the world?\u2019 Just how crazy this would be on the quarterback position, I have to admit I thought,'I wonder if Shane will call,\u2019\" Rivers said. \"Immediately, the competitor in you gets excited.\"</p><p>Rivers, an eight-time Pro-Bowler, has long worn the No. 17, and will continue to do so in his second stint with the Colts, courtesy of Jones.</p><p>\"I saw the injury live. I feel terrible for Daniel,\" Rivers said. \"I texted with Daniel about him being so gracious about 17. That was meaningful to me.\"</p><p>The Colts\u2019 injury crisis was compounded by the uncertainty about quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr.\u2019s health.\u00a0</p><p>Richardson, the fourth overall selection in the 2023 NFL Draft, was placed on injured reserve in October after he suffered an orbital fracture during a pregame warm-up.</p><p>The Colts visit the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/seattle-seahawks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seattle Seahawks</a> this Sunday in Week 15 action.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s</strong></i><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> sports coverage on X</a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

Discovery.</p><p>Neither Warner Bros. Discovery nor Netflix responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. A spokesperson for CNN declined to comment.</p><p>In October, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was putting itself up for sale. It previously said it was going to split into two companies \u2014 one for the studio and HBO, the other being the cable networks within the corporate umbrella.</p><p>Before Netflix emerged last week as the victor of the bidding war, it had seemed that Paramount owner David Ellison was in the driver's seat, only to be off-roaded by the streaming giant on Friday with its nearly $83 billion offer. On Monday, Paramount launched a $108 billion hostile takeover bid for the entire company, including its cable assets like CNN.</p><p>Trump's comments will likely loom over the bidding war because his administration could be a hurdle for both Netflix and Paramount to buy Warner Bros.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/trump-warns-netflix-warner-bros-discovery-deal-could-problem-says-hell-involved-decision\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>TRUMP WARNS NETFLIX-WARNER BROS DISCOVERY DEAL COULD BE A PROBLEM, SAYS HE'LL BE \u2018INVOLVED\u2019 IN DECISION</u></strong></a></p><p>CNN staffers are largely feeling \"grim\" about the prospects of CNN being owned by Ellison, who Trump has a cozy relationship with.</p><p>Network insiders say that their colleagues worry Ellison would overhaul CNN's editorial decisions the way he has with CBS News with his appointment of Bari Weiss as its editor-in-chief.</p><p>\"They see CBS as a complete and utter s--- show, which it was before this to be honest,\" one CNN staffer told <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox News Digital</a>, conceding \"our organization is also in chaos and crisis.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/senate-gears-up-intense-antitrust-hearing-wake-netflix-warner-bros-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>SENATE GEARS UP FOR 'INTENSE' ANTITRUST HEARING IN WAKE OF NETFLIX, WARNER BROS DEAL</u></strong></a></p><p>In August, Ellison took over Paramount as part of its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The deal was plagued by politics as Paramount settled Trump's election interference lawsuit against the company over CBS News' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>Kamala Harris</u></a>.\u00a0</p><p>Liberal critics accused Paramount of \"bending the knee\" to Trump in order for his FCC to approve the merger. They also expressed outrage over <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-cancels-the-late-show-stephen-colbert-end-program-may-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>CBS' cancellation</u></a> of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" which will stop airing after May 2026. The network insisted it was purely a financial decision, though critics believe it was also tied to the FCC-approved merger.\u00a0</p><p>During a CNBC interview Monday, Ellison was asked whether he would combine CNN and CBS News' newsgathering operations. He dodged the question, speaking instead about the broader goal he has for news, which is getting into the \"trust\" and \"truth business\" that \"speaks to the 70% of Americans in the middle,\" a sentiment previously echoed by Weiss.</p><p>However, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-netflix-warner-bros-battle-ellisons-a86fe15c?st=6zkB6m&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>reported</u></a> that Ellison had told Trump officials that he'd make sweeping changes to CNN if he became its owner and that Trump has been vocal about wanting CNN to have new ownership that will make programming changes.</p><p>\"I think everyone wants to be fair,\" a second CNN staffer said. \"I don't think [CNN colleagues] see Ellison as trying to target the political middle. I think they think he is kowtowing to Trump.\"</p><p>Trump has so far had a more agnostic approach to the bidding war despite his close relationship with Ellison, and his father, billionaire Larry Ellison. Last week, Trump praised Netflix as a \"great company\" and called its CEO, Ted Sarandos, a \"fantastic man\" but expressed concern about its market share.\u00a0</p><p>On Monday, he refrained from saying he supported Paramount's bid despite it being partially financed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner's private equity firm, Affinity Partners, something Trump told reporters he hadn't discussed with Kushner.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-unloads-cbs-60-minutes-over-marjorie-taylor-greenes-interview-demands-apology-rips-ownership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>blasted Paramount</u></a> over the \"60 Minutes\" interview featuring ally-turned-foe Rep.

Alonso is reportedly headed to the Baltimore Orioles, while Diaz will be joining the back-to-back reigning champion Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><p>It\u2019s a hard reality for Mets fans to accept, especially after Steve Cohen, by far the richest owner in the sport and a lifelong Mets fan, took control of the team five years ago. Yet the front office decided to let a homegrown talent and another fan favorite walk.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong>\u00a0</strong></i></p><p>That prompted longtime New York radio host Joe Beningo to <a href=\"https://www.audacy.com/stations/wfan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">call into his old station</a>, WFAN, to rip ownership and president of baseball operations David Stearns.</p><p>\"You know I can't stand David Stearns. He thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. We're gonna find out now how freaking smart David Stearns is. We're gonna find out how brilliant that Harvard education serves David Stearns. We'll see.\u00a0</p><p>\"But the guy that's the real culprit is the owner. The owner sold us a bill of goods. We all thought, we were all sucked in, 'Uncle Stevie's big money, it's never going to be the same like it was with the Wilpons,' and he spent money. [Justin] Verlander, [Max] Scherzer, he went on and got [Juan] Soto. But where is this guy? He's supposed to be like Mr. Met, I gotta see him courtside at the Garden at the playoff games with the Met hat on. What kind of Met fan are you? You telling me you're a Met fan, Cohen? Forget about Stearns, he's a fraud as far as a Met fan. He's probably got Yankee gear at home.\"</p><p>Beningo also compared Alonso\u2019s departure to Tom Seaver being traded and Darryl Strawberry signing with the Dodgers before making a bold proclamation about the team\u2019s former owners, who were notorious for being cheap.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/orioles-sign-star-slugger-record-contract-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ORIOLES SIGN STAR SLUGGER TO RECORD CONTRACT: REPORTS</strong></a></p><p>\"We all knew what the Wilpons were\u2026 but you know what? I really believe Fred Wilpon, Jeff Wilpon would have recognized what Alonso specifically meant to the organization, and they would have signed him. I really believe that,\" Beningo said, citing that the Wilpons extended David Wright to make him a lifelong Met. \"As much as we get on the Wilpons, and this guy is nowhere to be found. He sold us a bill of goods. I don't care what they do, I don't care what the little genius does now the rest of the way\u2026 it doesn't make up for this, and it doesn't make us a better team than the Dodgers.\"</p><p>\"The owner, I'm p----d at the owner,\" he added. \"I can't tell you how ticked off I am\u2026 He sold us a bill of goods and stuck it right up our rear end.\"</p><p>Earlier this offseason, the Mets also <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mets-rangers-agree-swap-all-stars-brandon-nimmo-marcus-semien-blockbuster-deal-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">traded Brandon Nimmo</a>, another homegrown talent, to the Texas Rangers for Marcus Semien. They also signed Devin Williams, who had a tumultuous season with the New York Yankees, to a three-year deal.</p><p>The offseason has plenty of time left, and players such as Kyle Tucker, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cody-bellinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cody Bellinger</a>, Bo Bichette and Framber Valdez remain available. But for now, Cohen and Stearns are public enemy No. 1 in Queens \u2014 just one year after being hailed as heroes for swiping Soto from the Bronx.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s\u00a0</strong></i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>,\u00a0and subscribe to\u00a0</strong></i><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

Conservatives in particular have panned the enhanced subsidies as a COVID-19-era relic that benefited insurance companies rather than Americans.</p><p>But some GOP lawmakers have joined Democrats in warning that failing to extend them at least temporarily at this point will result in millions of Americans seeing their <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-faces-holiday-crunch-health-care-fix-collides-shrinking-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">healthcare premiums skyrocket</a> while Congress refuses to act.</p><p>Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa., another Republican who signed the petition, said House GOP leaders signaled they would be \"putting forward\" a number of healthcare reforms \"that are very positive in nature,\" but \"an extension of the ACA tax credits was not included in that package.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/scalise-announces-gop-healthcare-overhaul-coming-next-few-weeks-amid-battle-over-expiring-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SCALISE ANNOUNCES GOP HEALTHCARE OVERHAUL COMING IN 'NEXT FEW WEEKS' AMID BATTLE OVER EXPIRING SUBSIDIES</strong></a></p><p>\"So, we have been talking about and advocating for that to move forward, and so this seems like the best vehicle to do that,\" Mackenzie said.\u00a0</p><p>He told Fox News Digital, \"The reason we're in this mess to begin with is that things were done in a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partisan fashion</a>. And, so, I think if we want longevity and reforms and changes, we should be doing it in a bipartisan fashion.</p><p>\"It's a time-sensitive matter, and it's an existential matter for people back home who we care about where this is a very real problem,\" Fitzpatrick told reporters. \"You try to do things through the normal course, you try to do things through regular order. When all those remedies are exhausted, then you've got to go this route, unfortunately.\"</p><p>Asked if it was spurred at all by moderates' conversation on the House floor with Johnson, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said, \"It was clear that, given the timeframe and given some of the differences within our conference on particular issues, that a bill was not going to be put forward. And so I think we all recognize the importance of getting an extension passed.\"</p><p>But it's not clear whether <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/democrats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">House Democratic leaders</a>, who have their own discharge petition for a three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies, will support the bill. It likely will not succeed without buy-in from all House Democrats.</p><p>Asked if his leaders would back it, Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, said, \"Go ask them. But I think they ought to.\"</p><p>Johnson, for his part, told reporters discharge petitions were \"typically used as a tool against the majority\" but said he was \"very sympathetic\" to moderate Republicans' concerns.</p><p>\"We have spent many, many hours trying to find a way out of the conundrum that we're in. With regard to those extensions, there's a lot of people who are very concerned about Obamacare and the fact that the subsidies were created by Democrats for COVID-era limited use,\" Johnson said.</p><p>\"We just can't get Republican votes on that for lots of reasons, not enough of them. And, so, look, my colleagues have made a decision. I don't take it against them personally, I don't operate that way. I have great respect for those guys, I understand the situation they're in for their districts, and we'll see how it plays out.\"</p>",

This includes possibly sensitive areas, like places of worship and medical facilities.<p>The argument for their legality rests upon the notion that these cameras are equivalent to 'mere observation', but the enormous scope and data sharing agreements in place to share and access <i>millions</i> of records without warrants blurs the lines of the fourth amendment.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46220794\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46220794</a></p>\n<p>Points: 115</p>\n<p># Comments: 68</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Hi HN, we're Aakash and Shuangling of InspectMind (<a href=\"https://www.inspectmind.ai/\">https://www.inspectmind.ai/</a>), an AI \u201cplan checker\u201d that finds issues in construction drawings, details, and specs.<p>Construction drawings quietly go out with lots of errors: dimension conflicts, co-ordination gaps, material mismatches,  missing details and more. These errors turn into delays and hundreds of thousands of dollars of rework during construction. InspectMind reviews the full drawing set of a construction project in minutes. It cross-checks architecture, engineering, and specifications to catch issues that cause rework before building begins.<p>Here\u2019s a video with some examples: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ</a>.<p>Before this, I (Aakash) built an engineering firm that worked on ~10,000 buildings across the US. One thing that always frustrated us: a lot of design coordination issues don\u2019t show up until construction starts. By then, the cost of a mistake can be 10\u2013100x higher, and everyone is scrambling to fix problems that could have been caught earlier.<p>We tried everything including checklists, overlay reviews, peer checks but scrolling through 500\u20132000 PDF sheets and remembering how every detail connects to every other sheet is a brittle process. City reviewers and GC pre-con teams try to catch issues too, yet they still sneak through.<p>We thought: if models can parse code and generate working software, maybe they can also help reason about the built environment on paper. So we built something we wished we had!<p>You upload drawings and specs (PDFs). The system breaks them into disciplines and detail hierarchies, parses geometry and text, and looks for inconsistencies: - Dimensions that don\u2019t reconcile across sheets; - Clearances blocked by mechanical/architectural elements; - Fire/safety details missing or mismatched; - Spec requirements that never made it into drawings; - Callouts referencing details that don\u2019t exist.<p>The output is a list of potential issues with sheet refs and locations for a human to review. We don\u2019t expect automation to replace design judgment, just to help ACE professionals not miss the obvious stuff. Current AIs are good at obvious stuff, plus can process data at quantities way beyond what humans can accurately do, so this is a good application for them.<p>Construction drawings aren't standardized and every firm names things differently. Earlier \u201cautomated checking\u201d tools relied heavily on manually-written rules per customer, and break when naming conventions change. Instead, we\u2019re using multimodal models for OCR + vector geometry, callout graphs across the entire set, constraint-based spatial checks, and retrieval-augmented code interpretation. No more hard-coded rules!<p>We\u2019re processing residential, commercial, and industrial projects today. Latency ranges from minutes to a few hours depending on sheet count. There\u2019s no onboarding required, simply upload PDFs. There are still lots of edge cases (PDF extraction weirdness, inconsistent layering, industry jargon), so we\u2019re learning a lot from failures, maybe more than successes. But the tech is already delivering results that couldn\u2019t be done with previous tools.<p>Pricing is pay-as-you-go: we give an instant online quote per project after you upload the project drawings. It\u2019s hard to do regular SaaS pricing since one project may be a home remodel and another may be a highrise. We\u2019re open to feedback on that too, we\u2019re still figuring it out.<p>If you work with drawings as an architect, engineer, MEP, GC preconstruction, real estate developer, plan reviewer  we\u2019d love a chance to run a sample set and hear what breaks, what\u2019s useful, and what\u2019s missing!<p>We\u2019ll be here all day to go into technical details about geometry parsing, clustering failures, code reasoning attempts or real-world construction stories about how things go wrong. Thanks for reading! We\u2019re happy to answer anything and look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386</a></p>\n<p>Points: 42</p>\n<p># Comments: 42</p>\n",

A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people,\u201d the president later posted on his Truth Social, sharing a link to the website for applicants.\n\n\u201cSO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!\u201d\n\nThe card purchases are revamping the backlogged and cumbersome EB-5 visa program that had awarded permanent legal status to foreigners who invest up to $1 million in US businesses.\n\nAs many as 250,000 foreigners were still waiting for their approvals as part of that program as of February this year.\n\nCongress authorized the visa program in 1990 to place investments of differing levels based on the region of the US. Some rural areas only required around $800,000 as opposed to $1 million.\n\nThe foreign investors also had to show they could create at least 10 American jobs with the funds.\n\nJust 135,518 EB-5 visas have been issued in its 25-year history, according to data from the Invest In the USA (IIUSA) trade association.\n\nPresident Donald Trump displays a signed executive order on gold card visa in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, September 19, 2025. REUTERS\n\nTrump expects that \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in revenue could result \u2014 and that top business leaders like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook have celebrated the gold card solution.\n\nOriginally set at a a $5 million price tag, the card has also been touted by Trump and his officials as a way of balancing the federal budget with more revenue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a line for EB-5 of 250,000 right now. 200,000 of these gold green cards [at $5 million] is $1 trillion to pay down our debt,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in February.\n\nThe nation\u2019s debt currently stands at more than $38 trillion.",

    "content": "*Set in an unnamed state in 2008, an idealistic 34-year-old lieutenant governor juggles familial issues and a challenging work life while preparing to take over the job of her mentor, the state's longtime incumbent governor, who suddenly accepts a cabinet position in the incoming Obama administration.*\n\nCast: Emma Mackey, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jack Lowden, Woody Harrelson, Rebecca Hall\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 21%\n\nMetacritic: 41\n\nSome reviews:\n\nJocelyn Noveck, Associated Press 1/4 - It\u2019s hard to understand how \u201cElla McCay,\u201d the first original feature from writer-director Brooks in 15 years, goes so utterly haywire. Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\u201d? \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d?\n\nJohnny Oleksinski, New York Post 1/4 - This sloppy slog is terrible; short, but interminable.\n\nMoira MacDonald, Seattle Times 2.5/4 - It\u2019s not at all unpleasant spending two hours with Ella and her family and colleagues, but it leaves you feeling a little nostalgic for what it could have been.\n\nRadheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail - Ella McCay, the movie, feels like we\u2019re being bear hugged by a lovable, slightly boozy old grand-uncle who genuinely hopes to find common ground with a new generation, but also can\u2019t help being a little patronizing.\n\nNick Schager, The Daily Beast - Its phoniness epitomized by Emma Mackey\u2019s lead turn, it\u2019s the biggest dud of the artist\u2019s career, and the holiday season\u2019s most egregious misfire.\n\nOdie Henderson, Boston Globe 2/4 - Ella McCay never registers as a real person; she\u2019s a collection of tics that Mackey desperately tries to play.\n\nVikram Murthi, IndieWire B - Watching \u201cElla McCay\u201d can sometimes feel like time travel, particularly for those vested in bygone eras of American filmmaking, but if you\u2019re capable of tuning into its wavelength, an old but worthwhile spirit can be found.\n\nTim Robey, Daily Telegraph (UK) 1/5 - There\u2019s not a great deal more to be said about the experience, except that it is best politely avoided, like a Christmas invitation from neighbours you find chirpy, well-meaning and off-puttingly strange on every collision.\n\nTara Brady, Irish Times 3/5 - At 85, Brooks retains an instinct for human foibles and complex characters, even if on this occasion the material doesn\u2019t always live up to his cast.\n\nTim Grierson, Screen International - This comedy-drama contains some of the crackling dialogue and disarming candour of Brooks\u2019 best work. Ultimately, however, this disjointed character study ultimately feels as messy as its heroine\u2019s life.\n\nAdrian Horton, Guardian 2/5 - Ella McCay is, first and foremost, a mess -- a clunky collection of incoherent characters and confounding plot that seem to defy basic story logic at every turn, and not in a surprising or intriguing way.\n\nWilliam Bibbiani, TheWrap - 'Ella McCay' is a film about American politics in the same way that Pixar\u2019s 'Cars' is a movie about cars. As in yes, these are definitely films about politics and cars. But no, politics and cars don't work like that.\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter - Almost everyone here is trying way too hard, with the exception of Mackey, who\u2019s appealing and natural even when stuck in a phony world full of phony characters.\n\nTaylor Williams, Slant Magazine 2/4 - As it follows its main character navigating political and personal waters, James L. Brook\u2019s film finds itself poised between sincerity and artificiality\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes page:\nhttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ella_mccay\n\nMetacritic page:\nhttps://www.metacritic.com/movie/ella-mccay/",

He\u2019s missed significant time due to injuries in 3/6 seasons. Speaking from personal experience, it\u2019s hard to want to keep doing a sport when you\u2019ve had so much pain caused by it.

I think all the internet BS and misinformation is more harmful to society when adults (like those who vote..!) get sucked in.   Maybe instead of banning, we turn off the share button and commenting?  So the internet is more about media than socializing?",

      "u/RoyalCities: These laws are such BS. If social media is so toxic it makes more sense to regulate large social media companies rather than banning kids by way of having every Adult send their ID to random companies to use the internet.\n\nFirst they could start by open sourcing the recommendation systems for public scrutiny if / when a social media platform gets very large and has millions of users. \n\nBasically all recommendation systems are just built around cosine similarity and Twitter has shown there is massive power in that tech.\n\nSo start off with real public oversight just so they KNOW how the levers are being skewed when they use it. Heck there is oversight in the food and drug markets since it directly deals with what people are putting in their body - I'd argue the fact a company can en-mass dictate what they can put in your mind warrants the same level of scrutiny. \n\nIf social media became so toxic and polarizing then maybe start by investigating HOW it got so bad - rather than just trying to gatekeep access to it because then you haven't really fixed the problem at all.",

Slaughter</i></a>, a case in which it is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/08/us/trump-supreme-court-presidential-power\">likely</a> to overturn <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/03/19/trump-fires-democratic-ftc-commissioners/\"><i>Humphrey's Executor</i></a>, a decision that would likely grant the president license not only to remove executive agency bureaucrats but to replace the Fed's Board of Governors. In view of these pressures, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), led by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, may be preemptively catering to President Donald Trump's calls to lower interest rates in a bid to avoid replacement if and when <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> is overturned.</p>\n<p>Trump has been egging the FOMC, the Fed's key policymaking body, to lower rates since this summer. In June, the president sent Powell a letter <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/07/30/the-federal-reserve-rightly-rejects-trumps-calls-for-lower-interest-rates/\">saying</a>, \"we should be paying 1% Interest, or better!\" In late July, with year-over-year inflation <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-inflation-pce.htm\">at 2.6 percent</a>, well above the Fed's 2 percent target, Powell and all but two members of <a href=\"http://two\">the 12-member FOMC</a> wisely <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/07/30/the-federal-reserve-rightly-rejects-trumps-calls-for-lower-interest-rates/\">held</a> the fed funds target constant. However, in mid-September, the Fed <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/18/the-federal-reserve-cuts-rates-with-inflation-still-hot-is-political-pressure-winning/\">decreased</a> the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, lowering <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU\">the upper bound</a> rate from 4.5 percent to 4.25 percent.</p>\n<p>Stephen Miran, nominated by Trump and confirmed as a member of the Fed's Board of Governors in September, shortly before the fed funds announcement, <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/18/the-federal-reserve-cuts-rates-with-inflation-still-hot-is-political-pressure-winning/\">dissented</a>. Per the FOMC's <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm\">official statement</a>, Miran \"preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point.\"</p>\n<p>At the end of October, the FOMC lowered the fed funds rate by another 25 basis points, leaving the upper bound at 4.0 percent. Miran again <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\">dissented</a>, preferring a 50 basis point decrease in the federal funds rate. Miran's dissent was juxtaposed by Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who voted against lowering the rate at all.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Miran yet again objected to the FOMC's decision to lower the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, preferring a 50-basis point drop. Schmid also dissented the same way he had in October, voting for no change whatsoever. On Wednesday, Schmid was joined in his opposition to rate cuts by Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\u00a0<em>The Wall Street Journal\u00a0</em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-cuts-rates-again-signals-it-may-be-done-for-now-67069bb5?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf2esxoM9yqmlinffEI--KMYinbGLTUwuUKMIlofYCNiBsGnUx01uXcCUxIxZ4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6939f37e&amp;gaa_sig=8V0puUDf4PCbW0z0kz0edLV08TLyE51-6wkTVYjCeghSm0uEI1QDerdKxKl1Eah-10vj5j1j3igelX0P_tC3wQ%3D%3D\">notes</a> that this is \"the first time in six years that three officials cast dissents.\"</p>\n<p>But two members of the FOMC voting against further rate cuts should not be surprising: Year-over-year inflation has been stubbornly increasing since April. The Consumer Price Index, the most common inflation metric and the one used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm\">rose</a> from 2.3 percent in April to 3 percent in September. Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-inflation-pce.htm\">increased</a> from 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent. At the same time, the unemployment rate has <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm\">increased</a> from 4.2 percent to 4.4 percent, while the labor force participation rate <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm\">decreased slightly</a> from 62.6 percent to 62.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Peter C. Earle, director of economics and economic freedom at the American Institute for Economic Research, tells <i>Reason</i> that the Fed's decision to continue lowering interest rates in the face of persistently elevated inflation signals that \"it has chosen to prioritize labor market softness over the purchasing power of the dollar and broader affordability concerns.\" Earle says the latest cut is risky, but defensible, as \"inflation projections for this year and 2026 have been revised lower, [while] unemployment forecasts remain steady, and private hiring data suggest a labor market that's cooling.\" More troubling than the decision itself is the phenomenon of \"members aligning their votes with rapid, deeper cuts in line with what the President has expressed a desire for.\"</p>\n<p>Earle predicts that, \"if presidential discretion over the Fed's Board of Governors expands in the wake of <i>Humphrey's Executor </i>[being overturned]&hellip;the result would be a Federal Reserve more vulnerable to serving the immediate priorities of the executive branch rather than maintaining consistent rules, stable money, and a predictable policy environment.\" Such central bank would \"weaken the dollar and undermine long-term investment planning,\" warns Earle.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/federal-reserve-defers-to-donald-trump-by-cutting-interest-rates-by-25-points/\">Federal Reserve Defers to Donald Trump by Cutting Interest Rates by 25 Points</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

Import taxes on machinery and fertilizer are raising farmers' costs. Foreign countries' retaliatory tariffs are closing off export markets.</p>\n<p>The contradictions of the Trump administration's agriculture bailout, however, go beyond using tariff revenue to ameliorate the costs of tariffs.</p>\n<p>Among those eligible for the <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/12/08/trump-administration-announces-12-billion-farmer-bridge-payments-american-farmers-impacted-unfair\">new bailout will be</a> growers of corn, sunflower, canola, rapeseed, and safflower\u2014that is to say, growers of the most common seeds used for seed oils.</p>\n<p>So, on the one hand, the Trump administration is encouraging Americans to consume fewer seed oils through policy nudges and the government's bully pulpit. On the other hand, it's bailing out the producers of the products that it wants Americans to consume less of.</p>\n<p>A more consistent policy would involve either welcoming the collapsing fortunes of seed growers or, alternatively, encouraging Americans to consume more seed oils to prop up the suffering industry.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Trump administration has settled on a contradictory effort to encourage seed oil production while suppressing seed oil consumption.</p>\n<p>Federal agriculture policy has long been a contradictory mix of hectoring nanny state restrictions on things you're not supposed to eat and subsidies for the producers of those same discouraged products.</p>\n<p>The MAHA movement was supposed to be a more significant break with past federal nutrition policy. Instead, it's found itself in the same contradictory position.</p>\n<p>The list of discouraged ingredients is a little heavier on seed oils and a little lighter on trans fats, but little else has changed about the government's crony relationship with the food industry.</p>\n<p>Consumers should take note. The federal government will always be more invested in keeping agricultural subsidies flowing than in improving the diets of the average American.</p>\n<p>Healthier consumption behaviors are ultimately going to come from better personal decisions, not policy nudges from Washington.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/the-maha-administration-bails-out-big-seed-oil/\">The MAHA Administration Bails Out Big Seed Oil</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

On its face, that move is a <a href=\"https://www.firearmspolicy.org/trump-admin-enacts-fpc-proposal-to-create-new-doj-second-amendment-rights-section\">welcome development</a> for defenders of the constitutional right to armed self-defense\u2014an impression reinforced by the <a href=\"https://www.bradyunited.org/press/doj-launch-of-new-gun-rights-office-second-amendment-civil-rights-division\">alarm</a> the new initiative has generated among gun control advocates. But the section's mission statement raises doubts about its commitment to Second Amendment advocacy. So does the Justice Department's (DOJ) ongoing defense of constitutionally dubious federal gun laws.</p>\n<p>\"I'm really excited about this,\" Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Civil Rights Division, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-promises-a-lot-more-action-gun-rights-new-second-amendment-enforcement-section\">told</a> Fox News. \"For the first time, the DOJ Civil Rights Division and the DOJ at large will be protecting and advancing our citizens' right to bear arms as part of our civil rights work&hellip;.As Attorney General Pam Bondi has said, the Second Amendment is not a second-class right, and I couldn't agree more with my boss.\"</p>\n<p>Dhillon said the Justice Department will challenge obstacles to obtaining concealed carry permits such as \"multi-thousand-dollar costs\" and \"unreasonably long delays.\" Another potential target, she said, is state bans on \"guns that should be protected by the Second Amendment\" under \"recent Supreme Court precedent,\" by which she presumably meant <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/05/14/assault-weapons-explained/\">\"assault weapon\" bans</a>. In a recent Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1259/379286/20251009151027698_24-1259RushOpp.pdf\">brief</a>, the government's lawyers suggested that \"cases involving state laws banning AR-15 rifles\" provide good \"vehicles for clarifying the appropriate framework for discerning what types of arms the Second Amendment protects.\"</p>\n<p>So far, so good. But the Justice Department's description of the Second Amendment Section's agenda should give pause to anyone familiar with the litigation inspired by the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf\"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a>, which clarified the Second Amendment test for gun control laws and cast doubt on the constitutionality of many longstanding firearm restrictions.</p>\n<p>The Second Amendment Section aims to protect \"the natural firearm rights of law-abiding American citizens and ensure that such rights to keep and bear arms will not be infringed,\" the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/second-amendment-section\">says</a>. \"The mission of the 2nd Amendment Section is to ensure that law-abiding American citizens may responsibly possess, carry, and use firearms.\"</p>\n<p>That \"law-abiding\" qualifier does not appear in the text of the Second Amendment. Nor is it \"consistent with this Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation\"\u2014the constitutional test established by <em>Bruen</em>. And taken literally, it excludes millions of peaceful Americans from exercising \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\"</p>\n<p>In the landmark Second Amendment case\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-290P.ZO\"><em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em></a>, the Supreme Court did refer to \"law-abiding citizens.\" It said the amendment \"does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\" And it upheld \"the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" But the Court also recognized that the phrase \"the people,\" which appears in the First, Fourth, Ninth, and 10th amendments as well as the Second, \"unambiguously refers to all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset.\" According to <em>Heller</em>, that language creates a \"strong presumption\" that the right to arms \"belongs to all Americans.\"</p>\n<p>In the 2023 case\u00a0<a href=\"https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/212835pen.pdf\"><em>Range v. Attorney General</em></a>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit unambiguously <a href=\"https://reason.com/2023/06/07/disarming-a-man-based-on-a-nonviolent-misdemeanor-is-unconstitutional-the-3rd-circuit-rules/\">rejected</a> the proposition that the Second Amendment applies only to \"law-abiding\" citizens. \"We are confident that the Supreme Court's references to 'law-abiding, responsible citizens' do not mean that every American who gets a traffic ticket is no longer among 'the people' protected by the Second Amendment,\" Judge Thomas M. Hardiman wrote in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p>What about more serious offenses, such as felonies? The problem with that reading, Hardiman said, is that it empowers the government to strip individuals of their constitutional rights based on how legislators decide to classify an offense. \"At root, the Government's claim that only 'law-abiding, responsible citizens' are protected by the Second Amendment devolves authority to legislators to decide whom to exclude from 'the people,'\" Hardiman noted. \"We reject that approach because such 'extreme deference gives legislatures unreviewable power to manipulate the Second Amendment by choosing a label.'\"</p>\n<p>The law at issue in that case was <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922\">18 USC 922(g)(1)</a>, which makes it a felony for anyone convicted of \"a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" to receive or possess a firearm. That provision, the 3rd Circuit ruled, was unconstitutional as applied to Bryan Range, a Pennsylvania man who lost his gun rights because he had pleaded guilty nearly three decades earlier to fraudulently obtaining $2,458 in food stamps by understating his income.</p>\n<p>Range's offense was a misdemeanor under Pennsylvania law, and his sentence was limited to restitution, a $100 fine, $288 in court costs, and three years of probation. But because his crime was notionally punishable by up to five years in prison, his conviction triggered Section 922(g)(1), which encompasses state misdemeanors punishable by more than two years of incarceration.</p>\n<p>\"The Government has not shown that the Nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation supports depriving Range of his Second Amendment right to possess a firearm,\" Hardiman wrote. \"Because the Government has not shown that our Republic has a longstanding history and tradition of depriving people like Range of their firearms, [it] cannot constitutionally strip him of his Second Amendment rights.\"</p>\n<p>As I explain in my new book <a href=\"https://beyondcontrolbook.net/\"><em>Beyond Control</em></a>, the law that deprived Range of his gun rights covers an absurdly broad spectrum of offenses, disarming millions of people with no history of violence. It does not matter what the offense entailed, how long ago it was committed, or what sentence was actually imposed. Section 922(g)(1) empowers Congress and state legislators to restrict the Second Amendment simply by authorizing maximum sentences that meet the provision's criteria, even if those penalties are rarely or never imposed in practice.</p>\n<p>Since <em>Bruen</em>, at least seven federal appeals courts have <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/10/will-scotus-resolve-the-circuit-split-on-a-law-that-disarms-people-based-on-nonviolent-crimes/\">ruled</a> that Section 922(g)(1) is constitutional in all of its applications. But at least three\u2014the <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/23-50452/23-50452-2024-09-18.pdf\">5th</a>, <a href=\"https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/24a0195p-06.pdf\">6th</a>, and <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/22-1557/22-1557-2023-06-20.pdf\">7th</a> circuits\u2014have joined the 3rd Circuit in holding that Section 922(g)(1) may be unconstitutional as applied to people with nonviolent criminal records.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department repeatedly defended that law against such challenges during the Biden administration. It continues to do so under the Trump administration, notwithstanding the president's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/protecting-second-amendment-rights/\">avowed commitment</a> to the Second Amendment and his <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/01/15/the-law-that-disarmed-trump-is-unfair-illogical-and-constitutionally-dubious/\">personal experience</a> with this law, which bars him from possessing firearms because he was <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/05/30/the-verdict-against-trump-suggests-jurors-bought-the-prosecutions-dubious-election-fraud-narrative/\">convicted</a> of state felonies involving falsification of business records.</p>\n<p>Consider the government's response to a Supreme Court petition from Melynda Vincent, a Utah social worker who is <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/06/12/17-years-ago-she-lost-her-gun-rights-for-passing-a-bad-check-she-wants-scotus-to-rectify-that-injustice/\">barred</a> from possessing firearms under Section 922(g)(1) because she was convicted of passing a bad check at a grocery store 17 years ago. Vincent is <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1155/358365/20250508130618964_Vincent%20Cert%20Petition%20-%20FINAL.pdf\">asking</a> the Court to resolve the circuit split on this issue, arguing that the law is unconstitutional as applied to her because \"our historical tradition of firearms regulation does not permit the federal government to permanently disarm someone based solely on the fact of a prior nonviolent criminal conviction.\" That is especially true, her lawyers say, when \"no evidence suggests that the person poses, or has ever posed, a threat to anyone else.\"</p>\n<p>In opposition to Vincent's petition, Solicitor General D. John Sauer <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1155/369383/20250811150023889_24-1155VincentOpp.pdf\">argues</a> that she \"cannot prevail on her Second Amendment challenge\" because the Justice Department has <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/06/27/criminal-justice-reformers-should-welcome-pam-bondis-gun-rights-restoration-initiative/\">revived</a> a previously moribund process for restoring the gun rights of people whom the attorney general determines are not \"likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety.\" But that process is entirely discretionary. If disarming someone like Vincent fails the\u00a0<em>Bruen</em> test, it is no answer to say she can beg for the restoration of constitutional rights she should not have lost to begin with.</p>\n<p>\"At least as a general matter,\" Sauer says, \"Section 922(g)(1)'s disarmament of convicted felons complies with the Second Amendment.\" In\u00a0<em>Heller</em>, he notes, the Supreme Court described \"longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons\" as \"presumptively lawful,\" and it quoted that language in subsequent decisions. But none of those cases directly addressed Section 922(g)(1), and describing certain restrictions as \"presumptively lawful\" suggests that presumption might be overcome in some circumstances. The Court in <em>Heller\u00a0</em>explicitly did not delve into the reasoning for that label, saying \"there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us.\"</p>\n<p>Sauer also trots out the familiar argument that \"death was 'the standard penalty for all serious crimes' at the founding,\" which he thinks means the lesser penalty of losing one's gun rights must be constitutional. But as Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted in a 2019 <a href=\"https://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2019/D03-15/C:18-1478:J:Barrett:dis:T:fnOp:N:2309276:S:0#page=27\">dissent</a> as an appeals court judge, \"the obvious point that the dead enjoy no rights does not tell us what the founding-era generation would have understood about the rights of felons who lived, discharged their sentences, and returned to society.\"</p>\n<p>It surely would be odd to argue, based on that \"obvious point,\" that people with felony records should automatically lose, say, the right to freedom of speech or the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Although Dhillon declares that \"the Second Amendment is not a second-class right,\" the government's position in this case seems to treat it that way.</p>\n<p>That position puts the Trump administration at odds with the National Rifle Association (NRA), the Firearms Policy Coalition, and the Second Amendment Foundation. Under <em>Bruen</em>, those groups argue in a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1155/362890/20250611142353837_24-1155%20-%20NRA%20-%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf\">brief</a> supporting Vincent's petition, \"all firearm regulations must be justified by historical tradition, including the regulations that <em>Heller</em> labeled 'presumptively lawful.'\"</p>\n<p>Delving into the historical evidence, the NRA et al. conclude that \"there is no tradition of disarming peaceable citizens.\" Historically, they say, \"nonviolent criminals\u2014including nonviolent felons\u2014who did not demonstrate a propensity for violence retained the ability to exercise their right to keep and bear arms.\" In fact, \"some laws expressly allowed or even required them to keep and bear arms\" for militia service.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration's position in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1234.html\"><em>United States v. Hemani</em></a> further illustrates its determination to restrict Second Amendment rights. That case, which the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/20/scotus-will-consider-the-constitutionality-of-the-federal-ban-on-gun-possession-by-illegal-drug-users/\">will hear</a> this term, involves 18 USC 922(g)(3), which <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/07/21/hunter-biden-walks-free-while-this-iowa-man-serves-4-years-for-the-same-crime/\">prohibits</a> gun possession by any \"unlawful user\" of a \"controlled substance.\" Like Section 922(g)(1), that provision disarms millions of Americans who pose no plausible threat to public safety, including cannabis consumers who live in states that have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. And as with Section 922(g)(1), the Trump administration <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/03/20/biden-decries-criminalization-of-cannabis-consumers-even-as-he-insists-they-have-no-second-amendment-rights/\">echoes</a> the Biden administration in <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/29/trump-an-avowed-second-amendment-champion-defends-a-gun-ban-with-no-historical-justification/\">arguing</a> that the law is perfectly constitutional.</p>\n<p>In the 2024 case\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-50312-CR0.pdf\"><em>United States v. Connelly</em></a>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found \"no historical justification for disarming a sober citizen not presently under an impairing influence.\" This year in <a href=\"https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/25/02/241998P.pdf\"><em>United States v. Cooper</em></a>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit agreed that specific prosecutions under Section 922(g)(3) may violate the Second Amendment. It concluded that \"nothing in our tradition allows disarmament simply because [someone] belongs to a category of people, drug users, that Congress has categorically deemed dangerous.\"</p>\n<p>The 5th Circuit and the 8th Circuit are wrong, Sauer <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1234/362144/20250602174403309_HemaniPetition.pdf\">argues</a> in\u00a0<em>Hemani</em>.\u00a0In making that case, he repeatedly states that Section 922(g)(3) \"disqualif[ies] only <em>habitual</em> users of illegal drugs from possessing firearms,\" which is not true. The ban applies to <em>all</em> consumers of federally prohibited drugs, no matter their pattern of use and regardless of whether they ever handle guns while intoxicated. It is analogous to a categorical ban on gun possession by alcohol consumers\u2014a point that Sauer obscures by equating all \"unlawful\" drug consumers with \"habitual drunkards.\"</p>\n<p>Sauer implausibly argues that all drug users, including occasional cannabis consumers and patients who use marijuana for symptom relief in compliance with state law, pose a danger to public safety that justifies disarming them. And even if there might be \"marginal cases\" where that is not true, he says, they can be addressed by seeking relief from the attorney general\u2014the same unsatisfactory solution he offers for people with nonviolent criminal records.</p>\n<p>The Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) <a href=\"https://www.firearmspolicy.org/trump-admin-enacts-fpc-proposal-to-create-new-doj-second-amendment-rights-section\">welcomed</a>\u00a0the Justice Department's Second Amendment Section as \"a major step toward properly recognizing the Second Amendment as protecting a real right that warrants the same institutional protection as all other enumerated rights.\" But it also noted that \"the DOJ continues\u2014at this moment\u2014to advance\u00a0harmful\u00a0and anti-originalist arguments in multiple ongoing cases, including efforts that would\u00a0narrow or even reverse major Second Amendment victories protecting millions of peaceable Americans.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to the Justice Department's defense of Section 922(g)(3), the FPC cited the government's position in cases involving the <a href=\"https://www.firearmspolicy.org/fpc-blasts-doj-motion-to-gut-second-amendment-victory-fires-back-in-new-court-brief\">ban</a> on guns in post offices and the National Firearms Act's <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/17/this-gun-case-harks-back-to-constitutional-concerns-about-the-limits-of-federal-power-that-now-seem-quaint/\">registration requirements</a>. The organization urged the Trump administration to \"immediately halt these contradictory litigation positions and begin supporting\u2014rather than opposing\u2014strong constitutional litigation that advances the very rights this new DOJ section is intended to protect.\"</p>\n<p>It is encouraging that the Justice Department plans to challenge policies and practices that infringe on the right to arms. But if it were serious about defending the Second Amendment, it would stop defending unjust, historically ungrounded laws that disarm Americans for no good reason.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/the-doj-says-it-will-challenge-unconstitutional-gun-policies-maybe-it-should-stop-defending-them/\">The DOJ Says It Will Challenge Unconstitutional Gun Policies.

    "full_content": "The GOP took up a challenge from Democrat Rep. Jasmine Crockett (TX-30) for people to find proof that Democrats were \"invoking violence,\" and it couldn't have backfired on her more spectacularly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs RedState reported, Crockett made headlines on Tuesday when she officially announced her run for a Senate seat in the great state of Texas.\n\nREAD MORE: New: Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett Officially Launches U.S. Senate Bid\n\nCrockett's Trainwreck Announcement Underscores Why She's Not Ready for Prime Time\n\nIn response, numerous clips have resurfaced of the crazy things the Democrat representative has said. In one example, Crockett made comments during her appearance in October on The Breakfast Club radio show (which features host Charlamagne tha God), following Charlie Kirk's assassination a month earlier.\n\nApparently, Crockett was so unaware of the massive numbers of Democrats who have incited violence against those on the right, that she apparently thought it would be hard to prove. But if you are a RedState reader, you know all too well that the proof is everywhere.\n\nDuring the lawmaker's appearance on the show, she said the following (It comes at the 7:12 minute mark):\n\n\"I challenge somebody to go and find a clip of a Democrat invoking violence.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, the GOP has accepted the challenge, sharing a short video on X on Wednesday with many clips of the vile comments, made by Democrats, calling for violence.\n\nWatch:\n\nJasmine Crockett: \u201cI challenge somebody to go and find a clip of a Democrat invoking violence.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere you go @JasmineForUS pic.twitter.com/zalak7LqJx \u2014 GOP (@GOP) December 10, 2025\n\nHere's just a sampling of what you hear in the video.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY-8): \"We're going to fight it in the courts. And we are going to fight it in the streets.\"\n\nDem Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA-14): \"When they go low, we're going to bury them below the Capitol. That's what we're going to do.\"\n\nDem Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-7): \"There needs to be unrest in the streets as long as there's unrest in our lives.\"\n\nDemocrat California Governor Gavin Newsom: \"We're walking down a damn different path. We're fighting fire with fire. And we're going to punch these sons of [....] in the mouth.\"\n\nDemocrat Rep. Derek Tran (CA-45): \"Fight back, punch back and make sure they stay down, and you know what, kick them when they're down. Because they deserve it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Crockett is featured in the clip several times, with her own invocations for violence.\n\n\"I think that you punch,\" Crockett said. \"I think you punch. I think you're okay. You okay with punching.\"\n\n\"We are not only going to punch you back, but we are going to knock you out,\" she added. \"Not only are we going to punch back, but we about to beat you down.\"\n\nSEE: Jasmine Crockett's Woman of the People Shtick Blows Up After Release of Latest FEC Filings\n\nALSO: Did Republicans Actually Trick Jasmine Crockett Into Running for Senate?\n\nThis is just more proof that those inciting/invoking violence against the other side of the political aisle are the Democrats and those on the left, not the other way around.\n\nCrockett's self-own might be funny if it weren't so disgusting and damaging to our country.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Do you enjoy RedState\u2019s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Yeah, boy, you guys are scared.\u201d\n\nA Somali college student in Minnesota has drawn significant criticism after he appeared in a social media video threatening to \u201cpop\u201d immigration agents. Hasan Mohamed, a student at Minnesota State University, posted the video on TikTok in which he stated that he would shoot ICE agents if they entered his neighborhood in Owatonna.\n\n\u201cICE, I actually heard you guys pulled up to Owatonna, the big O, and you pulled up when I was not there? Y\u2019all so puss-*ss sh*t, boy. You\u2019re gonna get popped next time I see you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBring the whole cavalry. Yeah, boy, you guys are scared.\u201d\n\nThe video was later deleted, and Mohamed appeared to issue an apology. After widespread backlash, he posted several follow-up videos describing the incident as a \u201clapse in [his] judgment,\u201d though many online responded by saying his apology seemed sarcastic rather than sincere.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect to be forgiven. I\u2019m just here to apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cI truly did not mean what I said. I was just trying to be funny.\u201d\n\nICE has continued operations throughout Minnesota as concerns grow about Somali illegal immigrants and fraud involving Somali migrants. The agency posted a video on X showing recent arrests in the state, accompanied by the caption \u201cMinnesota\u2019s weather is cloudy with a 100% chance of ICE.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanctuary policies and politicians like Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey allowed these pedophiles, domestic terrorists, and gang members to roam the streets and terrorize Americans,\u201d Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement last week about ICE activity in the state. \u201cICE law enforcement are risking their lives to protect Minnesotans while their own elected officials sit by and do nothing. No matter when and where, ICE will find, arrest, and deport ALL criminal illegal aliens.\u201d",

Smith\u2014focuses on how the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit weighed multiple IQ scores in a murder case.</p>\n\n<p>Joseph Clifton Smith was sentenced to death after a jury found him guilty of brutally murdering a man. Under Alabama law, Smith could demonstrate low intellectual functioning with an IQ of 70 or below and substantial deficits in adaptive behavior.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-872/342591/20250212131357854_2025.02.12%20--%20Hamm%20v.%20Smith%20Cert%20Petition%20FINAL.pdf\">court filings</a>, <strong>Smith received five IQ scores: 75, 74, 72, 78, and 74. When the case reached the 11th Circuit in 2023, the appeals court upheld a lower court decision vacating his death sentence.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The more controversial part of its decision was how it weighed Smith\u2019s IQ scores. Although each of the scores was above the 70-point threshold, the court said it wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Smith was intellectually disabled. Given the margin of error for IQ tests, the court said Smith\u2019s score could actually be as low as 69.</p>\n\n<p>It pointed to another Supreme Court decision\u2014Hall v. Florida\u2014which said that courts must consider the standard error of measurement when an IQ score is close to, but above, 70. It has also <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-797_n7io.pdf\">said</a> that courts should move beyond IQ and consider \u201cadaptive deficits,\u201d or things like changing behavior with different circumstances, when IQ scores are close to but above 70.</p>\n\n<p>Considering those deficits, <strong>the appeals court said Smith shouldn\u2019t receive the death penalty.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Alabama told the Supreme Court that this was the wrong approach and that Smith had a burden of proving disability by a preponderance of the evidence. Instead of focusing on the error range for a lower IQ score, courts should instead weigh the cumulative effect of multiple scores, Alabama said.</p>\n\n<p>Katherine Robertson, an attorney with the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office, told The Epoch Times that courts had strayed from the actual meaning of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>I think what we\u2019re looking for is just a return to what the Eighth Amendment actually requires, and a move away, ultimately, from all this judge-made precedent</strong>,\u201d she said. She add that \u201cour position in our office philosophically has always been: if you\u2019re competent enough to stand trial, then ... how do you get special treatment when it comes to the penalty phase?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While she wasn\u2019t asking the Supreme Court to overrule its precedent in Atkins, she said it would have to revisit it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think they\u2019re going to have to revisit it,\u201d she said, suggesting that it could foster a return to the true meaning of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>In the Atkins majority <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/536/304/\">opinion</a>, Justice John Paul Stevens said that society viewed mentally challenged individuals as less culpable than the average criminal. Among other things, he said that those individuals may be less able to give meaningful assistance to attorneys defending them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cMentally retarded defendants in the aggregate face a special risk of wrongful execution</strong>,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s unclear how the Supreme Court will rule but Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the decision in 2002.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has also intervened in support of Alabama. It <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-872/369406/20250811162544896_24-872%20--%20Hamm%20v%20Smith.pdf\">argued</a> that the decision in Atkins broke from the Eighth Amendment\u2019s original meaning but also afforded states flexibility in determining intellectual disability.</p>\n\n<p>Smith\u2019s attorneys, meanwhile, defended the appeals court decision and said courts should take a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to evaluating intellectual disability. Regardless of whether IQ scores are conclusive, they said, defendants should be able to present additional evidence surrounding their intellectual functioning.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T02:30:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 21:30</span>\n",

It\u2019s perfect in pretty much every way. I love the directing, the acting, and the actors. The CGI also looks phenomenal and still holds up incredibly well today. I know that the film\u2019s length was and still is controversial, but I actually don\u2019t mind it. I personally think that the buildup to Skull Island is incredible, and I think the whole movie was paced fairly well - the first hour in New York and on the ship, the second hour on the island, and the third and final hour back in New York with Kong causing chaos. What do you all think? I think this is still the best version of Kong; I wish the newer movies had kept the 2005 design.\n\nEdit - this is in no way a diss to the other films. I like King Kong, no matter what. I just personally really enjoy this movie and think it's the best. That's just my opinion. I like having discussions and seeing them; at the end of the day, they're all good films in their own way.",

As we saw, though, when Joe Biden came along with his \u201copen the floodgates\u201d policy, the Left actually has no interest in securing the border or stopping the flow of illegal drugs and aliens. In fact, they actively work against any efforts to do so.\n\nIn his '24 campaign, Trump continued to stress the importance of taking action, and that is one very big reason he was able to win a second non-consecutive term as the commander in chief.\n\nOn Wednesday, his administration focused once again on keeping the boundary secure, as the Interior Department announced new military zones on the border between Canada and Mexico:\n\nThe Department of Interior said it would transfer jurisdiction along most of California's border with Mexico to the Navy to reinforce \"the historic role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty.\" The Interior Department described the newest national defense area in California as a high-traffic zone for unlawful crossings by immigrants. But Border Patrol arrests along the southern U.S. border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since the 1960s amid President Trump's push for mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, CBS News, for pointing out that arrests by the Border Patrol have dropped to virtually zero. Why? Because of Trump\u2019s policies, like this new one. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, CBS.\n\nTake a look at what it was like under Joe Biden:\n\nAliens seeking asylum at the California US - Mexico border just south of San Ysidro port of entry.\n\n\n\nHomeland Security expects up to 13,000 crossings per day once Title 42 expires.\n\n\n\n- PoliceFrequency pic.twitter.com/ZuXXPacdi1 \u2014 suzy (@Suzy_1776) May 2, 2023\n\nThe move puts the military in charge of large swaths of what were formerly high-crossing areas:\n\nThe move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops to detain people who enter the country illegally and sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. It is done under the authority of the national emergency on the border declared by President Donald Trump on his first day in office.\n\nThe U.S. wants the zones operational to help combat the human smuggling networks and insidious drug cartels, both of which Trump has long emphasized. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a press release Wednesday that it is important to honor the \u201chistoric role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty\u201d:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy working with the Navy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use, and advancing the President's agenda.\n\nBy working with @USNavy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use and advancing @POTUS' agenda to put the safety and security of the American people FIRST! https://t.co/c2oYAdOeht \u2014 Secretary Doug Burgum (@SecretaryBurgum) December 10, 2025\n\nTrump promised over 10 years ago that he was going to fix the border \u2014 and he\u2019s been doing just that since he took up residence again in the White House in January. Promises made, promises kept.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: We voted for mass deportations, not mass amnesty. Help us continue to fight back against those trying to go against the will of the American people.\n\nJoin RedState's VIP today and use promo code FIGHT to get 60% off your VIP membership.",

During a speech to the crowd of pastors at the Shiloh archeological site in the West Bank, Evans addressed recent remarks from Vice President JD Vance and President Trump about not supporting the Israeli annexation of the Palestinian territory, which he calls Judea and Samaria.</p>\n\n<p>\"You said that the policy of the administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. <strong>Mr. Vice President, we love you, and we love America, but the policy of the God who birthed America and the policy of the God who gave these people this land</strong> is in fact that Judea and Samaria is Bible land,\" Evans said.</p>\n\n<p>\"Eighty percent of Bible stories come out of Judea and Samaria. So don\u2019t pressure Israel to give illegal, radical Islam Jew-haters Judea and Samaria,\" he said, adding that the MAGA movement is based on the Bible and \"upon the God of this book, the God of Israel.\"</p>\n\n<p>While American evangelicals have always comprised a solid base of support for Israel, <strong>that support has been declining</strong>, part of an overall trend among Americans due to Israel's brutal campaign in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>\"<strong>There is a growing cancer within the evangelical movement</strong> in America, where people are thinking Israel doesn\u2019t matter and there\u2019s nothing biblical about our relationship with Israel.

no one wants to watch these movies.\u00a0 However, some distributors can't help themselves as they search foreign markets to purchase far-left content and get their ideological fix.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The newest foreign art house slop making it's way to Netflix audiences in the US this month is a movie called \"Queen Of Coal\", originally titled \"Miss Carbon\" in Argentina where the flick was originally released.\u00a0 Pedro Pascal plays a role in the film (of course he does), and it's set to hit Netflix on December 19th.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The story is a docudrama based on the true story of an 18-year-old man named\u00a0Carlos Antonella Rodr\u00edguez\u00a0who gets work as a coal miner in 2011.\u00a0 He then \"transitions\" over the course of a few years to become a transgender woman named \"Carlita\" (take note of the almost worshipful manner in which the trans character is portrayed).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yb6RMRrXnJ8\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Carlos is officially recognized as a woman under an Argentina law enacted on May 23, 2012.\u00a0 It was the world's first legislation to allow legal gender recognition based on self-identification, without requiring medical interventions, psychological diagnoses, or judicial approval (this might be something that Javier Milei should look into).\u00a0 The man was then declared the \"first woman coal miner\" in Argentina's history.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>That's right, a man dressed up as a woman defeated the patriarchy for all women because he is now legally considered a real woman in Argentina.\u00a0 In other words, this is a lot like Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner) winning Glamour Magazine's \"woman of the year.\"\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Netflix describes the movie as:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Carlita, a trans woman, dreams of working in the coal mines but faces superstitions and a ban on female workers, forcing her to fight for her place and disrupt the system.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/QueenCoal2.jpg?itok=K5TDSrec\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/QueenCoal2.jpg?itok=K5TDSrec\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"13661f7d-41f5-4045-89db-71c72bdd1369\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"631\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/QueenCoal2.jpg?itok=K5TDSrec\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Some might wonder why anyone would \"dream\" of becoming a coal miner.\u00a0 No one does, but in Argentina in 2012 coal mining was considered a higher paying job ($1500 per month US).\u00a0 Carlos does not actually extract coal, he repairs machinery that helps in the mining of coal, but is technically considered a \"coal miner\".</p>\n\n<p>Some people might remember the explosive controversy over Netflix's distribution of the 2020 film \"Cuties\" - A French movie featuring 11-year-old girls in a highly sexualized dance troupe.\u00a0 Critics accused the filmmakers of creating thinly veiled child pornography disguised as feminist empowerment.\u00a0 The film's director is a female Muslim feminist from Senegal who grew up in a polygamous family.\u00a0 Around 10% of Senegalese Muslim marriages involve minors under the age of 15.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The foreign feature did not go over well with American audiences, except for leftist activists who widely defended the movie and even argued in favor of the child dance scenes.\u00a0 Much was revealed about the political left in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There has been a similar reaction with the announcement of Queen Of Coal:\u00a0 Audiences are laughing at the concept while rejecting the basic premise that a man can become a women and then be declared the \"first woman coal miner\".\u00a0 It does not appear that the film will draw many viewers for Netflix, but it does showcase why Netflix's attempted purchase of Warner Bros. is very bad for movie goers.\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T03:45:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 22:45</span>\n",

On Sept. 2, he found the federal government had violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>\n\n<p>The federal government has argued that the sometimes-violent protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were interfering with the government\u2019s ability to enforce federal immigration law.</p>\n\n<p>Although the federal Posse Comitatus Act restricts the ability of the federal government to use military resources for domestic law enforcement, a president may take over, or federalize, state National Guard troops on an emergency basis in certain circumstances.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cThe Founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balances. Defendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one,\u201d</strong></em> Breyer wrote in the court <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70496361/225/newsom-v-trump/\">order</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSix months after they first federalized the California National Guard, Defendants still retain control of approximately 300 Guardsmen, despite no evidence that execution of federal law is impeded in any way\u2014let alone significantly.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The judge also rejected the administration\u2019s argument that the court system has no authority to review a president\u2019s takeover of state National Guard troops in an emergency situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Breyer wrote that it was \u201cnonsensical to suggest that the law would permit a president to ... send Guardsmen wherever he wanted for as long as he wanted.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>After California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to block the deployment, the Trump administration took the position that \u201cafter a valid initial federalization, all subsequent re-federalizations are completely, and forever, unreviewable by the courts,\u201d the judge wrote.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cDefendants\u2019 position is contrary to law,\u201d </strong>and, coupled with the Trump administration\u2019s deployment of California National Guard troops to other states, is \u201ceffectively creating a national police force made up of state troops,\u201d the judge added.</em></p>\n\n<p>Breyer stayed his preliminary injunction until noon on Dec. 15, presumably to give the federal government an opportunity to appeal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Newsom hailed the ruling.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is abundantly clear \u2013 the federalization of the National Guard in California is illegal and must end,\u201d the governor said in a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/12/10/federal-court-to-trump-keeping-a-standing-army-is-illegal-the-federalization-of-californias-national-guard-must-end/\">statement</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe President deployed these brave men and women against their own communities, removing them from essential public safety operations. We look forward to all National Guard servicemembers being returned to state service.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p>The Epoch Times reached out to the Department of Justice for comment. No reply was received by publication time.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, on Sept. 8 the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/supreme-court-lifts-restrictions-on-immigration-stops-in-southern-california-5911940\">stayed</a> a lower court order restricting immigration stops in Southern California. Three justices dissented.</p>\n\n<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement started operations in the Los Angeles area on June 6. Local and state officials strongly criticized the effort, saying the federal government was overstepping its legal authority.</p>\n\n<p>The high court order paused a temporary restraining order that Judge Maame Frimpong of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued on July 11 that limited the factors that law enforcement officials may use when making immigration-related stops and arrests.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, Frimpong barred the Department of Homeland Security from stopping or arresting individuals based exclusively on factors such as the language the person speaks or where the person works.</p>\n\n<p>In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \u201cWe should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh filed a concurring opinion.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cApparent ethnicity alone\u201d is not enough to establish the reasonable suspicion needed to justify an immigration stop, but it may be relevant to the issue,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T03:20:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 22:20</span>\n",

U.N. officials have described UNRWA as the backbone of Gaza\u2019s aid effort during the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, but the Trump administration has accused the group of ties to Hamas \u2013 an allegation the agency vehemently disputes.</p><p>Washington, once UNRWA\u2019s biggest donor, froze funding in January 2024 after Israel accused roughly a dozen staff members of involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war.</p><p>In October, Secretary of State <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marco Rubio</a> referred to UNRWA as a subsidiary of Hamas.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/new-film-probes-un-agencys-alleged-terror-ties-claims-fueled-israeli-palestinian-conflict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>NEW FILM PROBES UN AGENCY\u2019S ALLEGED TERROR TIES AND CLAIMS IT FUELED THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT</strong></a></p><p>\"UNRWA's not going to play any role in it,\" Rubio said at the time when asked whether the agency would assist in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. \"The United Nations is here. They're on the ground. We're willing to work with them if they can make it work, but not UNRWA. UNRWA became a subsidiary of Hamas.\"</p><p>Reuters reported it was unclear whether recent internal discussions focused on sanctioning the entire agency or specific officials or operations, and that U.S. officials have not yet settled on what type of sanctions they might pursue.</p><p>The sources said the State Department has discussed declaring UNRWA a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" or FTO \u2013 a step that would financially isolate the agency.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-under-fire-usaid-investigators-probe-hamas-diversion-aid-gaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>UN UNDER FIRE AS USAID INVESTIGATORS PROBE HAMAS DIVERSION OF AID TO GAZA</strong></a></p><p>Any broad move against UNRWA could disrupt refugee aid across the region, as the agency is already facing a severe funding crisis. Such sanctions would be highly unusual, since the U.S. is both a U.N. member and the host nation of the body that created the agency in 1949.</p><p>William Deere, who heads UNRWA\u2019s Washington office, said the group would be \"disappointed\" if officials were discussing an <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FTO designation</a>, calling such a step \"unprecedented and unwarranted.\"</p><p>He pointed to multiple investigations \u2013 including one by the U.S. National Intelligence Council \u2013 that concluded UNRWA remains a neutral and essential humanitarian actor.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/unrwa-schools-hijacked-hamas-watchdog-report-warns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>UNRWA SCHOOLS \u2018HIJACKED BY HAMAS,\u2019 WATCHDOG REPORT WARNS</strong></a></p><p>The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment. The U.S. and Israel have maintained tough positions towards the agency, particularly in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre.</p><p>President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump</a> in February reaffirmed that the U.S. would not fund UNRWA. In the executive order, Trump said that \"UNRWA has reportedly been infiltrated by members of groups long designated by the Secretary of State as foreign terrorist organizations, and UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.\"</p><p>When the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/experts-slam-un-court-ruling-israel-warn-opinion-also-a-real-danger-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) in April 2025 demanded Israel work with UNRWA, Washington backed Israel, saying it was under no obligation to work with the agency and had \"ample grounds to question UNRWA\u2019s impartiality.\"</p><p>UNRWA announced in August 2024 the end of an investigation by the Office of Internal Oversight Services into whether its staff participated in the attacks, as Israel claimed.</p><p>The probe examined 19 employees and resulted in nine dismissals over evidence that \"could indicate\" involvement. The investigation found one case with no evidence of involvement and nine others in which \"the evidence obtained by OIOS was insufficient\" to prove participation, the agency said.</p><p><i>Fox News Digital\u2019s Rachel Wolf and Reuters contributed to this report.</i></p>",

And then I said it again, and I realized, \u2018Boy, I really am offending him now. Forgive me,\u2019\" he recalled. \"I didn\u2019t understand how deeply held his faith was and how much of an organizing principle it was for him as well.\"</p><p>Although the governor admitted he's more spiritual than religious, he acknowledged the value in Kirk building a movement that merged \"creating community, a sense of belonging, meaning, identity.\"</p><p>Newsom added that while \"there are a lot of grievances\" he holds about some of Kirk's views, \"there are also a lot of grievances I have in this space, that my party has completely neglected this space, that we haven\u2019t been organizing the campuses.\"</p><p>\"We haven\u2019t been organizing young men. We haven\u2019t been addressing their societal screams, their concerns. Their suicide rate \u2014 four times that of women. Their dropout rates. Their depths of despair. We have men who are suffering, and it\u2019s hurting women. Any mother understands this,\" he explained.</p><p>Wrapping up his reflection on Kirk's impact on young men, Newsom recalled how excited his son was when he found out that he was interviewing the TPUSA founder, telling his father, \"You really need to get to know him, Dad.\"</p><p>\"I started to wake up to this reality that the Democratic Party needs to wake up to. And that\u2019s, again, the entry into why I did this podcast and had those folks on as first guests,\" he shared.</p>",

But re-watching it now, I realize that Aurelio is absolutely *terrified*. He realizes that if John thinks for a moment that he's helped Tarasov that he's dead, whereas if he humiliates Tarsov and kicks him out at least he has a chance of surviving Viggo's wrath. Both the scenes with Tarasov and the scenes with John he's basically making the case for his life, just in different ways.\n\nIt's easy to miss because John doesn't show any overt hostility towards Aurelio but part of Reeves' performance is he doesn't often show that, and the (apparently) calm drinking scene where Aurelio pours John a drink and they have the brief conversation about Tarasov is still one fraught with tension.\n\nAurelio's anxiousness is most evident when Tarasov first shows up with the car. It's not just Aurelio being disdainful of Tarasov, he's acutely aware that now he's involved, and knows that John's going to show up at some point. And if John thinks Aurelio helped Tarasov that he's a dead man. It's honestly a fantastic performance from Leguizamo, an all time great character actor, demonstrating a mix of emotions that I think often gets overlooked. It's honestly kind of amusing that he's demonstrating less fear during the conversation with Viggo (although not none) than he is when he's talking to Tarasov.",

The pilot was honestly not that funny or fun to me, and the premise felt like it was forcing itself to be the cheerleading version of Glee. That said, episode 4 though? Something clicked. Maybe it was just the hilarious guest star Jeff Hiller playing a corporate Willy Wonka factory owner with an absolutely stupid accent, or just that the show stopped trying so hard, but I finally see a glimmer of fun here, and I hope it continues through the rest of the season (and maybe onwards).\n\nI'd love to hear what other viewers think.",

    "content": "I just finished Hulu\u2019s All\u2019s Fair season 1. The show was fine imo. Pretty on brand with all that Ryan Murphy does: great idea, okay execution, campy fun mixed with BIG emotions in a way that doesn\u2019t always work and of course a lot of pointless sex.\n\nThe show was a critical failure even before it came out and I won\u2019t go into why (hint: people hate women). One thing that people keep bringing up is that Kim Kardashian is an awful actor. I however disagree.\n\nOf course it\u2019s important to point out that Kim is not an actor. She\u2019s a\u2026 daughter of Kris Jenner and I mean good for her. I\u2019m not too familiar with her work as an influencer and have never watched her reality show.\n\nFor me this is one case where I doubt she would be a good casting choice for any other role on any other show but in All\u2019s Fair her performance works for me. I mean she is just playing herself and doing a good job at it. Her performance is believable although it doesn\u2019t pull on too many emotions but that fits the character.\n\nI think her lack of versatility may become a problem if they try to expand on her character in later seasons but for S1 it worked for me. I don\u2019t think she needs an Emmy but people love to hate just for the sake of hating.\n\nEnd disclaimer: I don\u2019t think she should take job opportunities from real actors but I don\u2019t think that that is what happened here. To me it seems like she asked her friend (Murphy) to create a show where she can play a lawyer since she doesn\u2019t seem to be able to pass the bar thus creating jobs for struggling actors like Glenn Close (/j).\n\nTL;DR:\nI think that Kim\u2019s performance worked for this role quite well and all the hate is unnecessary.",

Daily Mail readers, meanwhile, have been told that the budget has taken from hard-working families to give to benefit claimants.</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly what the powers-that-be want people to believe, not only as the old divide-and-rule strategy, but because society needs to understand that jobs are disappearing rapidly, and the future is basic universal income and total dependence on the state.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The looming technocracy has no use for the majority of the workforce.</strong> Data and distribution centres will be run by robots. Artificial intelligence will rise through the occupational strata to replace professional practitioners such as lawyers and doctors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Call it new technology<br />\nAnd they use it to burn<br />\nAnd they show no concern<br />\nWork for their prosperity<br />\nWhile the big wheels turn<br />\nNow it\u2019s too late to learn<br />\nDon\u2019t upset the teacher<br />\nThough we know he lied to you<br />\nDon\u2019t upset the preacher<br />\nHe\u2019s gonna close his eyes for you</p>\n\n<p>And it\u2019s a shame<br />\nThat you\u2019re so afraid<br />\nJust a worker waiting in the pouring rain<br />\nPutting back the pieces of a broken dream</p>\n\n<p>Father worked in industry<br />\nNow the work has moved on<br />\nAnd the factory\u2019s gone<br />\nSee them sell your history<br />\nWhere once you were strong<br />\nAnd you used to belong<br />\nThere was once a future<br />\nFor a working man<br />\nThere was once a lifetime<br />\nFor a skillful hand \u2013 yesterday</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prophetic words by the band Erasure, back in 1986.<strong> But most people do not heed the warnings, preferring to shoot the messenger.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A talented OffGuardian writer, Todd Hayen, has decided to stop writing due to the abusive responses to\u00a0<a href=\"https://off-guardian.org/2025/11/29/it-isnt-that-big-of-a-deal/\">his latest article</a>\u00a0on the persistent faith of citizens in government and in official narratives. He used the term \u2018sheep\u2019 for the easily herded folk who take the vaccines and believe in the scripted saviours and bogeymen.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Funny how the same people can be utterly convinced that their own pet catastrophes\u2014Trump returning to power, climate change, systemic racism, white supremacy, overpopulation, or the rise of the far right\u2014are existential threats that will end life as we know it unless we surrender every freedom immediately to stop them. But mention digital id, central bank digital currencies, vaccine passports, social credit systems, or the creeping transhumanist agenda, and suddenly you\u2019re the paranoid one wearing a tinfoil hat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The threats to humanity are \u2013 or at least should be \u2013 emphatically clear. A digital prison is being built around us, with the implicit consent of the \u2018sheep\u2019, who still think that technology will solve our problems. Convenience, security and efficiency are prized over meaningful social interaction, privacy and freedom. As Hayen explained, this delusion was primed long ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of them have been psychologically and educationally groomed for decades to believe that socialism, Marxism, or outright communism are not only benign but morally superior. \u2018From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\u2019 sounds noble when you\u2019ve never watched the state decide what your needs actually are. They think communism is free healthcare, student-debt forgiveness, and government UBI cheques. They have no idea it\u2019s secret police at 3 a.m., neighbours denouncing neighbours for extra bread rations, gulags, re-education camps, forced confessions, and a boot stamping on a human face\u2014forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am no less against global corporate capitalism and fascism as I am of leftist totalitarianism, but merely a minority of critical thinkers see through the Left versus Right paradigm. Ask a progressive liberal student whether she\u2019d expect a fascist government to give free money to everyone in society, of whatever colour or creed, and she\u2019d probably scoff at such a ridiculous notion. Welfare is a thing of the Left \u2013 that\u2019s how younger generations are taught to love Big Brother.</p>\n\n<p>Britons are led to believe that the government will always be there as a safety net, when the jobs are gone. Therefore, they don\u2019t threaten aa uprising on the throwing of taxpayers\u2019 money at Ukraine or on the perpetual influx \u2013 a million every year \u2013 of immigrants whose cheap labour will be a temporary pursuit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The budget is misunderstood by the majority as a giveaway to the workshy.

    "content": "\n<p>Father of five here, and founder of a social media marketing company (exited).   Our kids are up against problems we didn't have during the great expansion of social. The three big things:<p>1. State level actors and well funded not for profits are fighting an information war to influence our kids. And they are very good at it. Down to having troll farms to talk one on one. Every time something new happens in the world, my younger kids ask me about what they saw on Tik-Tok and their initial understanding is shaped by a well funded actor, and is often completely a false narrative. The solution is be open and talk about it with your kids.<p>2. Criminals are even better at social than state level actors. They are smooth. And they are on platforms you wouldn't expect - like games. And criminals aren't all about fraud. They sell drugs, they try to physically steal in real life from your kids,they'll try to get your kids to do something embarrasing and blackmail them with it, and even can be human traffickers. Again, the solution is be open and talk about it with your kids - and make sure they know it's ok to ask, and it's especially ok if you think I shouldn't share this with Dad or they person is saying not to show your parents.<p>3. Sexual predators are even better at social than the criminals. The difference is that the predators can't hide behind national borders so they are very careful. Same solution as $#2, but this one is really tough because when your kids come to you about it, they may have shared something with the predator that the predator is using to extort them into hooking up. Don't attack or blame your kid, focus on making sure the predator never gets to them<p>I do not believe for a minute that social media was good for my kids as they grew up, but I'm not sure that you can even begin to fix it the way AU is trying to - regulating speech, association using prohibition is dipping a colander in the river to filter the silt.</p>\n",

A New Jersey doctor who wanted to treat patients from nearby states also joined the challenge, as did other plaintiffs who have since passed away or retired.</p><p>One of the plaintiffs, Dr. Paul Bryman, said he was disappointed by the ruling. \"Terminal patients outside New Jersey should have the option of medical aid in dying without having to travel long distances,\" he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/delawares-assisted-suicide-bill-signed-law-making-11th-state-statute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DELAWARE'S ASSISTED SUICIDE BILL SIGNED INTO LAW, MAKING IT THE 11TH STATE WITH SUCH A STATUTE</strong></a></p><p>New Jersey Gov. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/phil-murphy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Phil Murphy</a>, a Democrat, signed the measure into law in 2019, saying at the time that while his Catholic faith might prevent him from choosing assisted suicide for himself, he supported the right of others to make that decision.</p><p>Under the law, a patient must be an adult New Jersey resident with a terminal diagnosis and a prognosis of six months or fewer to live. Two physicians must confirm the diagnosis and the patient\u2019s capacity to decide. Patients must make two requests \u2014 at least one of them in writing with two witnesses \u2014 and must be given the opportunity to rescind.</p><p>At least one witness cannot be a family member, heir, attending physician or an employee of the facility where the patient receives care. Patients must self-administer the medication, and doctors are required to offer alternatives such as palliative care.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/love-you-forever-author-may-soon-die-assisted-suicide-pro-life-groups-call-decision-heartbreaking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>\u2018LOVE YOU FOREVER\u2019 AUTHOR MAY SOON DIE BY ASSISTED SUICIDE, PRO-LIFE GROUPS CALL DECISION \u2018HEARTBREAKING\u2019</strong></a></p><p>A lower court previously dismissed the challenge, finding that physician-assisted suicide is not a fundamental right states must extend to non-residents.

Their timeless power and magnificence rise above even the most bitter political differences to quietly bring all Americans together.\"</p><p>Suckling continued, \"It\u2019s disgusting of Trump to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">politicize America\u2019s most sacred refuge</a> by pasting his face over the national parks in the same way he slaps his corporate name on buildings, restaurants, and golf courses.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-trump-department-rolls-out-christmas-tree-savings-plan-making-this-season-brighter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TOP TRUMP DEPARTMENT ROLLS OUT CHRISTMAS TREE SAVINGS PLAN: \u2018MAKING THIS SEASON BRIGHTER'</strong></a></p><p>The executive director added that national parks \"are not a personal branding opportunity.\"</p><p>\"They\u2019re the pride and joy of the American people,\" he asserted.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, the 2026 America the Beautiful Pass was supposed to feature an image of Glacier National Park, the winner of the photo contest.</p><p>\"Instead the Department of the Interior (DOI) replaced it with a closeup of President Trump\u2019s face,\" the center said, adding that the Glacier National Park photo was \"illegally relegated\" to the new \"Nonresident\" pass.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/burgum-labels-california-national-security-threat-energy-chief-warns-blue-states-skewing-cost-averages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>BURGUM CALLS CALIFORNIA A \u2018NATIONAL SECURITY RISK\u2019 AS ENERGY CHIEF WARNS BLUE STATES ARE SKEWING COST AVERAGES</strong></a></p><p>The center argued that the Trump administration broke the law by using a photo that was \"not taken on federal land and was not entered in the public contest, and by creating new Resident and Nonresident passes expressly prohibited by the law.\"</p><p>\"America the Beautiful means wild rivers and majestic mountains, not a headshot of a bloated, fragile, attention-seeking ego,\" Suckling stated. \"There\u2019s nothing beautiful about that.\"</p><p>On Nov. 25, the DOI announced the launch of \"<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/travel/national-park-passes-put-american-families-first-while-tripling-entry-fees-some\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">America the Beautiful passes</a>\" intended to put \"American families first\" by implementing a new resident-focused fee beginning Jan. 1, 2026.
