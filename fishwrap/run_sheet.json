During a rally Tuesday evening in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, President Trump reminded both Republicans and Democrats of just how savvy a messenger he can be when energizing his base. He crushed former President Joe Biden and his administration for overseeing the runaway inflation we are still battling today. He discussed his efforts to bring higher wage jobs to American workers, not illegal aliens. He dismantled Obamacare, highlighting high costs and the trillions in taxpayer dollars given to insurance companies instead of the American people. President Trump went full MAGA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe energy in the room was electric. The subliminal message was clear: Republicans, take this message and run with it during the 2026 midterm election cycle. President Trump tore apart Obamacare. He is tired of insurance companies lining their pockets with Obamacare subsidies, and stated once again that he wants that money sent directly to the American people.\n\n.@POTUS: \"Under Obamacare, trillions of dollars were given directly to health insurance companies...I want to give billions of dollars directly to the people...I want to give NOTHING to the insurance companies...We want you to go out and buy your own health insurance.\" pic.twitter.com/Yrr3dmZOmF \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump Touts the Economy and Tackles 'Affordability' in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump Shares Incredible Update About National Guardsman Shot in DC Terror Attack\n\nImagine being able to use your own money to purchase health insurance instead of those dollars going straight to the insurance companies? For Republicans in 2026, this is a smart policy that could excite the base in an election cycle where President Trump is not on the ballot. Healthcare across America, in many cases, is unaffordable and frustrating. This is certainly an area where the GOP can make up ground with sound policy ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump has essentially closed our southern border by the sheer power he wields through the executive branch. The administration has now moved to tackle illegal immigration within our borders, in regards to both deportations and American jobs taken by illegal aliens.\n\n.@POTUS: Before I took office, 100% of all net new jobs were going to migrants and illegals. Since I took office, 100% of ALL net job creation is going to AMERICAN CITIZENS \u2014 and now, more Americans are working than any time in the history of our country. pic.twitter.com/7zBoCrPCAE \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nWow. Since President Trump took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American citizens. That is an amazing statistic that every GOP House and Senate member should be touting on the campaign trail. Not for nothing, but President Trump is also clearly tired of immigrants coming to America who do not care to fully assimilate or share our values.\n\n.@POTUS: \"If you don't share our values, contribute to our economy, and assimilate into our society, then we don\u2019t want you in our country \u2014 we don't want you.\" pic.twitter.com/NqBWr1ceZ3 \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump also announced a permanent pause on third-world migration, \"including from hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia, and many other countries.\" This is a very smart and, frankly, important policy. During the recent off-year election cycle, many Americans learned for the first time how many third-world immigrants have infiltrated major American cities. This is a winning message and one the GOP should carry into 2026.\n\nFinally, the deadly drugs have got to stop flowing into this country. President Trump has taken lethal action that is sure to have every drug boat planning to bring drugs to America second-guessing that decision. For some Republicans who support Trump's policy but have struggled to properly communicate the importance to their constituents, the president simplified the issue for the entire party.\n\n\ud83d\udea8POTUS on Venezuelan Drug Boats: \"Think about it\u2014every boat that gets hit, we save 25,000 American lives.\" pic.twitter.com/Kd9mMQBXgJ \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) December 10, 2025\n\nThis is where President Trump is at his best. Instead of litigating the action he has taken on the Venezuelan drug boats, he simply points to the number of American lives his actions are saving. 25,000 American lives is not a small number. For the GOP in 2026, the message from President Trump in Pennsylvania is crystal clear: \"After just 10 months, our border is secure, our spirit is restored, inflation is stopped, wages are up, prices are down...and America is back!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow his lead.\n\nEditor's Note: Help RedState continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration's accomplishments as we continue to usher in the Golden Era of America.

      "full_content": "\u201cBring the whole cavalry. Yeah, boy, you guys are scared.\u201d\n\nA Somali college student in Minnesota has drawn significant criticism after he appeared in a social media video threatening to \u201cpop\u201d immigration agents. Hasan Mohamed, a student at Minnesota State University, posted the video on TikTok in which he stated that he would shoot ICE agents if they entered his neighborhood in Owatonna.\n\n\u201cICE, I actually heard you guys pulled up to Owatonna, the big O, and you pulled up when I was not there? Y\u2019all so puss-*ss sh*t, boy. You\u2019re gonna get popped next time I see you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBring the whole cavalry. Yeah, boy, you guys are scared.\u201d\n\nThe video was later deleted, and Mohamed appeared to issue an apology. After widespread backlash, he posted several follow-up videos describing the incident as a \u201clapse in [his] judgment,\u201d though many online responded by saying his apology seemed sarcastic rather than sincere.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect to be forgiven. I\u2019m just here to apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cI truly did not mean what I said. I was just trying to be funny.\u201d\n\nICE has continued operations throughout Minnesota as concerns grow about Somali illegal immigrants and fraud involving Somali migrants. The agency posted a video on X showing recent arrests in the state, accompanied by the caption \u201cMinnesota\u2019s weather is cloudy with a 100% chance of ICE.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanctuary policies and politicians like Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey allowed these pedophiles, domestic terrorists, and gang members to roam the streets and terrorize Americans,\u201d Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement last week about ICE activity in the state. \u201cICE law enforcement are risking their lives to protect Minnesotans while their own elected officials sit by and do nothing. No matter when and where, ICE will find, arrest, and deport ALL criminal illegal aliens.\u201d",

      "full_content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2013 Ukrainian officials were expected to hand their latest peace proposals to United States negotiators Wednesday, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who also said Ukraine would be ready for elections within three months if partners can guarantee a safe vote during wartime and if its electoral law can be altered.\n\nZelenskyy was responding to comments by U.S. President Donald Trump in which he questioned Ukraine\u00b4s democracy and suggested the Ukrainian leader was using the war as an excuse not to hold an election.\n\nZelenskyy told reporters late Tuesday that he is \u201cready\u201d for an election but would need help from the U.S. and possibly Europe to ensure security for a vote to happen. He suggested that Ukraine could be ready to hold balloting in 60 to 90 days if that proviso is met.\n\n\u201cTo hold elections, two issues must be addressed: primarily, security \u2013 how to conduct them, how to do it under strikes, under missile attacks; and a question regarding our military \u2013 how they would vote,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\n\u201cAnd the second issue is the legislative framework required to ensure the legitimacy of elections,\u201d he said.\n\nPreviously, Zelenskyy had pointed out that a ballot can\u2019t legally take place while martial law imposed due to Russia\u2019s invasion nearly four years ago is in place. He has also asked how a vote could happen when civilian areas of Ukraine are being bombarded by Russia and almost 20% of the country is under Russian occupation.\n\nZelenskyy said he has asked lawmakers from his party in Parliament to draw up legislative proposals that would allow elections while Ukraine is under martial law.\n\nUkrainians have on the whole supported Zelenskyy\u2019s arguments, and there has been no clamor in Ukraine for an election. Under the Ukrainian law that is in force, Zelenskyy\u00b4s rule is legitimate.\n\nBut with Trump pressing hard for a deal between Kyiv and Moscow, Zelenskyy is walking a tightrope between defending Ukrainian interests and showing the American president that he is willing to make some compromises.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly complained that Zelenskyy can\u2019t legitimately negotiate a peace settlement because his five-year term in office that began in 2019 has expired.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an important time to hold an election. They\u2019re using war not to hold an election,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Politico, echoing Moscow\u2019s stance.\n\nA new U.S. national security strategy released last Friday made it clear that Trump wants to improve America\u00b4s relationship with Moscow and \u201creestablish strategic stability with Russia.\u201d\n\nThe document also portrays European allies as weak.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday praised Trump\u2019s role in the Ukraine peace effort, saying in a speech at the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia\u2019s Parliament, that Moscow appreciates his \u201ccommitment to dialogue.\u201d Trump, Lavrov said, is \u201cthe only Western leader\u201d who shows \u201can understanding of the reasons that made war in Ukraine inevitable.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s decisions are likely to be pivotal for Ukraine, Washington\u2019s peace efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nTrump\u2019s initial peace proposal was heavily slanted toward Russia\u2019s demands. To counter that, Zelenskyy has turned to his European supporters.\n\nIn recent days, Zelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nZelenskyy said three documents were being discussed with American and European partners \u2013 a 20-point framework document that is constantly changing, a document on security guarantees, and a document about Ukraine\u2019s recovery.\n\nEurope\u2019s support is uneven, however, and that has meant a drop-off in military aid since the Trump administration this year cut off supplies to Kyiv unless they were paid for by other NATO countries.\n\nForeign military help for Ukraine fell sharply over the summer, and that trend continued through September and October, a German body that tracks international help for Ukraine said Wednesday.\n\nAverage annual aid, mostly provided by the U.S. and Europe, was around 41.6 euros billion ($48.4 billion) between 2022-2024. But so far this year Ukraine has received just 32.5 billion euros ($37.8 billion), the Kiel Institute said.\n\n\u201cIf this slower pace continues in the remaining months (of the year), 2025 will become the year with the lowest level of new aid allocations\u201d since the war began, it said.\n\nThis year, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have substantially increased their help for Ukraine, while Germany nearly tripled its average monthly allocations and France and the U.K. both more than doubled their contributions, according to the Kiel Institute.\n\nOn the other hand, it said, Spain recorded no new military aid for Kyiv in 2025 while Italy reduced its low contributions by 15% compared with 2022-2024.",

A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people,\u201d the president later posted on his Truth Social, sharing a link to the website for applicants.\n\n\u201cSO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!\u201d\n\nThe card purchases are revamping the backlogged and cumbersome EB-5 visa program that had awarded permanent legal status to foreigners who invest up to $1 million in US businesses.\n\nAs many as 250,000 foreigners were still waiting for their approvals as part of that program as of February this year.\n\nCongress authorized the visa program in 1990 to place investments of differing levels based on the region of the US. Some rural areas only required around $800,000 as opposed to $1 million.\n\nThe foreign investors also had to show they could create at least 10 American jobs with the funds.\n\nJust 135,518 EB-5 visas have been issued in its 25-year history, according to data from the Invest In the USA (IIUSA) trade association.\n\nPresident Donald Trump displays a signed executive order on gold card visa in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, September 19, 2025. REUTERS\n\nTrump expects that \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in revenue could result \u2014 and that top business leaders like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook have celebrated the gold card solution.\n\nOriginally set at a a $5 million price tag, the card has also been touted by Trump and his officials as a way of balancing the federal budget with more revenue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a line for EB-5 of 250,000 right now. 200,000 of these gold green cards [at $5 million] is $1 trillion to pay down our debt,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in February.\n\nThe nation\u2019s debt currently stands at more than $38 trillion.",

      "full_content": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard to Los Angeles, returning control to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).\n\nU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee and brother of former Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, ruled that Trump illegally kept about 100 troops deployed in Los Angeles months after sending troops amid violent protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement this summer, The Hill news outlet reported.\n\n\u201cThe Founders designed our government to be a system of checks and balances,\u201d Breyer wrote in his opinion. \u201cDefendants, however, make clear that the only check they want is a blank one.\u201d\n\nBreyer paused his ruling until Monday to give the Justice Department time to appeal, which the White House indicated that it plans to.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump exercised his lawful authority to deploy National Guard troops to support federal officers and assets following violent riots that local leaders like Newscum refused to stop,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.\u201d\n\nTrump deployed thousands of National Guardsmen to Los Angeles in the summer, resulting in a lawsuit from Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D).\n\nThe judge blocked Trump's initial deployment of the National Guard, but an appeals court later halted the ruling. However, most of the National Guardsmen have since been sent home.\n\nBreyer\u2019s Wednesday decision blocks Trump's extension that kept 300 California National Guardsmen under federal control until February. Only 100 remain in Los Angeles, as 200 were sent to Oregon.\n\n\u201cOnce again, a court has firmly rejected the President\u2019s attempt to make the National Guard a traveling national police force,\u201d Bonta said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFor more than five months, the Trump Administration has held California National Guard troops hostage as part of its political games. But the President is not King. And he cannot federalize the National Guard whenever, wherever, and for however long he wants, without justification. This is a good day for our democracy and the strength of the rule of law.\u201d",

Jasmine Crockett (TX-30) for people to find proof that Democrats were \"invoking violence,\" and it couldn't have backfired on her more spectacularly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs RedState reported, Crockett made headlines on Tuesday when she officially announced her run for a Senate seat in the great state of Texas.\n\nREAD MORE: New: Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett Officially Launches U.S. Senate Bid\n\nCrockett's Trainwreck Announcement Underscores Why She's Not Ready for Prime Time\n\nIn response, numerous clips have resurfaced of the crazy things the Democrat representative has said. In one example, Crockett made comments during her appearance in October on The Breakfast Club radio show (which features host Charlamagne tha God), following Charlie Kirk's assassination a month earlier.\n\nApparently, Crockett was so unaware of the massive numbers of Democrats who have incited violence against those on the right, that she apparently thought it would be hard to prove. But if you are a RedState reader, you know all too well that the proof is everywhere.\n\nDuring the lawmaker's appearance on the show, she said the following (It comes at the 7:12 minute mark):\n\n\"I challenge somebody to go and find a clip of a Democrat invoking violence.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, the GOP has accepted the challenge, sharing a short video on X on Wednesday with many clips of the vile comments, made by Democrats, calling for violence.\n\nWatch:\n\nJasmine Crockett: \u201cI challenge somebody to go and find a clip of a Democrat invoking violence.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere you go @JasmineForUS pic.twitter.com/zalak7LqJx \u2014 GOP (@GOP) December 10, 2025\n\nHere's just a sampling of what you hear in the video.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY-8): \"We're going to fight it in the courts. And we are going to fight it in the streets.\"\n\nDem Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA-14): \"When they go low, we're going to bury them below the Capitol. That's what we're going to do.\"\n\nDem Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-7): \"There needs to be unrest in the streets as long as there's unrest in our lives.\"\n\nDemocrat California Governor Gavin Newsom: \"We're walking down a damn different path. We're fighting fire with fire. And we're going to punch these sons of [....] in the mouth.\"\n\nDemocrat Rep. Derek Tran (CA-45): \"Fight back, punch back and make sure they stay down, and you know what, kick them when they're down. Because they deserve it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Crockett is featured in the clip several times, with her own invocations for violence.\n\n\"I think that you punch,\" Crockett said. \"I think you punch. I think you're okay. You okay with punching.\"\n\n\"We are not only going to punch you back, but we are going to knock you out,\" she added. \"Not only are we going to punch back, but we about to beat you down.\"\n\nSEE: Jasmine Crockett's Woman of the People Shtick Blows Up After Release of Latest FEC Filings\n\nALSO: Did Republicans Actually Trick Jasmine Crockett Into Running for Senate?\n\nThis is just more proof that those inciting/invoking violence against the other side of the political aisle are the Democrats and those on the left, not the other way around.\n\nCrockett's self-own might be funny if it weren't so disgusting and damaging to our country.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Do you enjoy RedState\u2019s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

      "full_content": "American workers saw their inflation-adjusted pay increase for the fifth consecutive quarter, providing continued relief on household budgets even as the pace of compensation growth moderates from pandemic-era peaks.\n\nTotal compensation for private-sector workers rose 3.5 percent in the 12 months ending in September, while inflation increased roughly 3 percent over the same period, according to the Employment Cost Index released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That left workers with real purchasing power gains of 0.6 percent for wages and salaries and 0.5 percent for total compensation including benefits.\n\nThe quarterly data showed wages and salaries increased 0.8 percent in the three months ending September 30, matching the pace of total compensation growth. Benefits, which include health insurance and retirement contributions, also rose 0.8 percent during the quarter.\n\nThe 3.5 percent annual increase represents a significant moderation from peaks above five percent in late 2022. However, workers are in a stronger position now than during that earlier period, when inflation was running at 6 percent or higher, eroding purchasing power despite the faster nominal wage growth. The current pace marks the slowest compensation growth since early 2021, but it\u2019s also one of the few periods since the pandemic where paychecks have consistently outpaced price increases.\n\nThe Employment Cost Index, favored by Federal Reserve policymakers because it controls for shifts in the types of jobs people hold, provides a clearer picture of pure wage pressure and labor market health than other measures. Unlike average hourly earnings data, the ECI isolates how much employers are raising pay for the same positions rather than reflecting changes in employment mix.\n\nRegional Variation in Pay Gains\n\nThe data revealed substantial geographic differences in compensation growth. Workers in the Miami metro area saw 12-month pay increases of 5.7 percent, while those in Seattle received 4.7 percent more. By contrast, the Washington, D.C. area recorded just 2.2 percent compensation growth, the slowest among major metropolitan regions tracked.\n\nManufacturing workers saw wages rise 3.6 percent annually, while education and health services workers experienced 3.9 percent growth. Union workers continued to see faster pay gains than non-union employees, with increases of 4.5 percent versus 3.5 percent respectively.\n\nThe report\u2019s release was delayed more than five weeks due to the federal government shutdown that lasted from late September through mid-November. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that data collection was interrupted before the shutdown began, and survey response rates decreased for the September quarter.\n\n\u201cAfter funding had been restored, any data self-reported by establishments during the shutdown were reviewed and included; however, survey response rates decreased in September,\u201d the agency stated in the report.\n\nThe next Employment Cost Index, originally scheduled for December, has been rescheduled to February 10, 2026.\n\nImplications for Consumers and Monetary Policy\n\nThe continued real wage gains suggest American households have maintained some ability to absorb price increases without cutting back on spending. Consumer expenditures have remained resilient through 2025 despite elevated prices for housing, food, and other essentials compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, the moderating pace of compensation growth alongside positive but slower inflation readings may support continued interest rate cuts as policymakers seek to balance employment and price stability objectives.\n\nThe moderation in wage growth reflects a jobs market that has cooled considerably from the red-hot conditions of 2021-2022, when employers faced severe worker shortages. Hiring has slowed and job openings have declined, reducing workers\u2019 leverage in salary negotiations even as layoffs remain relatively low by historical standards.\n\nStill, the fact that paychecks continue growing faster than prices means the average worker can buy slightly more with their paycheck than they could a year ago, providing at least some cushion against ongoing affordability concerns that have dominated household financial anxiety since inflation surged in 2021.",

      "full_content": "\"Switching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department\u2019s official correspondence.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has directed diplomats to ditch the font used by the Biden administration and return to the Times New Roman typeface for official communications.\n\nIn an \"Action Request\" memo obtained by the New York Times, Rubio said that switching back to the font would \"restore decorum and professionalism to the department\u2019s written work.\" The memo stated that Calibri, which Biden administration Secretary of State Antony Blinken ordered the switch to in 2023, was \"informal\" compared to serif typefaces such as Times New Roman, and \"clashes\" with the department\u2019s letterhead. The document\u2019s authenticity was confirmed by a State Department official.\n\nThe memo, bearing the subject line \"Return to Tradition: Times New Roman 14-Point Font Required for All Department Paper,\" said that the change to Calibri \"was not among the department\u2019s most illegal, immoral, radical or wasteful instances of DEIA,\" the acronym for diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. Rubio said the switch was a failure, and that \"accessibility-based document remediation cases\" had not declined.\n\nRubio wrote, \"Switching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department\u2019s official correspondence.\" Times New Roman, Rubio wrote, had been the official typeface of the department for nearly 20 years. Prior to 2004, the State Department used Courier New.\n\nBlinken changed the font in 2023 after a recommendation came from the State Department\u2019s office of diversity and inclusion. The switch to Calibri, which is viewed as a more modern, accessible font, was meant to improve readability for those with vision problems, dyslexia, and those who use assistive technology such as screen readers.\n\nRubio\u2019s order said that Serif typefaces, such as Times New Roman, are \"generally perceived to connote tradition, formality and ceremony,\" and used by other federal government entities such as the White House and Supreme Court.",

But the basic idea was the same: to establish whose clubhouse it really is.\n\nFor an emblem of player-commissioner relations in the NFL today, the New York Times reporter Ken Belson writes, look to the \u201cRoger Goodell Bro Hug.\u201d Every spring, the newest first-round picks bound across the NFL draft stage and wrap their arms around the commissioner. Sometimes they lift him off his feet. A hug Goodell shared with Baltimore Ravens draftee Malaki Starks this past April lasted 21 seconds. Speaking to Belson, an agent laments the annual show of affection for management, though he can\u2019t help but admire the bleak triumph it signals: \u201cYou have to give kudos to the NFL for making it that way.\u201d\n\nBelson\u2019s new book, Every Day Is Sunday: How Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, and Roger Goodell Turned the NFL into a Cultural & Economic Juggernaut, is a sobering account of how the NFL made the world this way, its way, totally in its image. Today, the football fan wakes to kickoffs in London and Berlin; she dozes off to the drawl of Cris Collinsworth, whose network pays $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Night Football. In 2024, NFL games accounted for 72 of the 100 highest-rated broadcasts on American TV. The year before, without the election and Olympics to account for, that number was 93.\n\nNFL revenues have more than tripled since Belson began covering the league's inner workings in 2013. Since then, the NFL has glided through obstacles: damning concussion research, increased attention on players arrested for domestic violence, high-profile player protests, tawdry owner scandals, the rise of streaming services, and overtures from private equity. In the book\u2019s acknowledgements, Belson recalls his Times editor\u2019s early mandate to cover the NFL \u201cas a really, really big business.\u201d Off the field were the real stories. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not at whatever folks consider to be the \u2018big game\u2019 of the week.\u201d\n\nThe Goodell presented in Every Day Is Sunday might be flattered by that kind of attention. At a 2010 meeting, he presented owners with a then-unthinkable financial target, to grow league revenue from $8 billion to $25 billion by 2027. In doing so, Goodell set his sights far beyond the little Sports Tuesday section on B8. \u201cRoger doesn\u2019t view the other leagues as competition,\u201d an NFL staffer tells Belson. \u201cHe wants to be mentioned with Disney and the Vatican, these massive institutions.\u201d Now in his 20th season as commissioner, Goodell has won his bosses gobs of money with what Belson paints as both political savvy and quiet ambition. The $25 billion vision will indeed come to pass in a couple of years, but the prophet won\u2019t be satisfied. When a friend emailed him the stat about 93 of 100 broadcasts, Goodell replied, \u201cWe have a couple of more spots to fill!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a story to read in the book\u2019s negative space: If Goodell, Kraft, and Jones have built the NFL as we know it now, it\u2019s been built almost entirely on ownership\u2019s terms. When they are drawn at all, the lines between labor and management are quickly smudged by a slick league PR apparatus. Rarely these days are the lines drawn by the sport\u2019s most prominent players. (Per the book\u2019s index, Magary, Drew is mentioned once, the same number of times as Mahomes, Patrick.)\n\nGoodell became commissioner in 2006, months after the NFL signed a CBA granting players 52 percent of league revenue after deductions. Owners quickly soured on the split. (\u201cA mean mother,\u201d Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called it.) In 2008, they exercised an opt-out clause to shorten the deal by a year. The 2011 lockout that followed marked the start of a prolonged\u2014and maybe still active\u2014period of backlash. For enduring labor\u2019s brief edge, the billionaires were owed reparations. As then-Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson put it at a 2010 owners meeting, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stick together and take back our league.\u201d That phrase, \u201cour league,\u201d confirms a suspicion voiced in the book by Jeff Saturday, a lead NFLPA player rep at the time: \u201cI feel like at times Jerry [Richardson] felt like the owners had created this thing as opposed to the other way around.\u201d The eventual 2011 deal reduced players' share of league revenue to 47 percent. Saturday and Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, christened the end of the lockout with a hug.\n\nRob Carr/Getty Images\n\nEvery Day Is Sunday brought to mind John Helyar\u2019s 1994 classic Lords of the Realm, a dishy history of labor wins in baseball. (Come back! It\u2019s interesting! I swear!) Helyar finds an easy hero in the union boss Marvin Miller, whose gift for \u201cconsciousness-raising\u201d made the MLBPA the gold standard. Miller turned \u201ccompliant peons to budding rebels\u201d with a message so simple and eternal that today a raw milk-drinking, de-blooded, re-blooded red-ass superstar slugger getting Wobbly just scans as basic gene expression. \u201cYou are the game,\u201d Miller told the players. \u201cWithout you there is no game.\u201d That spirit won MLB players free agency, better pensions, and the right to salary arbitration. Bit by bit, they clawed power away from \u201cthe Lords.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, these two books tell opposite stories, but it might be truer to call them different parts of the same story. In Belson\u2019s sequel\u2014spoiler!\u2014the Lords strike back. A chapter on the 2017 player protests is both instructive and nauseating as a peek into the NFL's corporate machinery. After players knelt during the national anthem in protest of police brutality, Goodell arranged a meeting between players and owners. One of the players was Anquan Boldin, whose goals here were not particularly lofty. Before the meeting, he told Goodell he wanted the owners to join the players in calling for legislative reform. \u201cIf an owner or the commissioner goes into a meeting with me, the conversation changes from a photo op to talking about true issues,\u201d he said.\n\nBoldin repeated this wish to owners in the meeting, a recording of which was sent to Belson:\n\nLater in the meeting, Boldin was more direct. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018players are being militant,\u2019 we\u2019re looked at as villains,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can have owners come and say, nationally, that no, they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re Americans, they care about the cities they\u2019re in, they care about these issues, we care about these issues, we\u2019re behind them, we\u2019re gonna educate ourselves about these issues, and we\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re gonna push forward. That changes us as a nation.\u201d\n\nAny genuine desires Boldin and the players voiced in that meeting would re-emerge from a Park Avenue boardroom as the Inspire Change initiative. Everyone was allowed to write \u201cEnd Racism\u201d on their cleats. Tension bubbled up again the next year, when owners pushed to officially mandate standing for the anthem. But that story ends tidily, with Kraft recruiting Jay-Z to produce the Super Bowl halftime show. It ends also with an amendment to the NFL game operations manual: \u201cAll teams and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and anthem.\u201d Earlier this year, the \u201cEnd Racism\u201d messaging was quietly scrapped.\n\nInterviewed for Ben Lindbergh\u2019s Lords of the Realm retrospective at The Ringer in 2019, Helyar noted a recent \u201ccreep toward owners\u201d in baseball. Belson\u2019s book warns that labor peace only means it\u2019s time to get back on defense. That can be hard in sports, where the labor force is trained to take things one game at a time. Owners like to leverage the brevity of most athletic careers to paint the real fight as one among labor, imagined between stars and scrubs. In an Atlanta Braves investor call this past June, Manfred copped to the clubhouse tour strategy: \u201cI usually try to avoid the high-earning guy at this point and find a younger player and say, \u2018Look, if you\u2019re one of the 10 percent, it\u2019s a great deal. But if you\u2019re the other 90, it ain\u2019t so good.\u2019\u201d Collier, an MVP candidate who co-founded the offseason league Unrivaled, has been charged with having a conflict of interest that would make her less sensitive to (or even the beneficiary of) a WNBA lockout.\n\nWhy do Kraft, Jones, and Goodell win so much? One trait they share is a stubborn belief in their own permanence. If Jones should ever die, visitors to the Dallas Cowboys' stadium may see him live on in hologram form; AI Jerry pops up at the end of the \u201cOwners Experience Tour.\u201d Kraft and Jones both star in multi-part docu-hagiographies, available to stream. Even in their eighties, neither owner speaks much of succession, and friends of Goodell\u2019s say they have never heard him mention retirement either. Every day is Sunday, and it will be forever.\n\nMiller asked players to think on exactly these terms, to remember that their cause transcends any one life or contract. \u201cThis could be my last year in baseball, and if the strike lasts the entire season and I\u2019ve played my last game, well, it will be painful,\u201d Giants player rep Willie Mays tells his fellow reps in a union meeting in Lords of the Realm, during the 1972 strike. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t hang together, everything we\u2019ve worked for will be lost.\u201d There\u2019s another means of immortality, not the hologram or the docuseries, just the simple vow to keep an eye out for someone else so they can one day do the same. When he signed a record contract with the New York Yankees in 2019, ace Gerrit Cole thanked Curt Flood and Miller, labor heroes he\u2019d first learned about from a veteran teammate in Pittsburgh. Of particular concern to Collier, she said in her press conference, were the underpaid stars coming up in the league, the ones four or five years younger. Harper has already signed the last big contract he will ever sign. We\u2019ll all die one day, but there\u2019s still some part to play, some piece of the fight to wage. You can hug it out, or you can pick up a bat.",

Somehow, the sentence I'm about to write is even more dispiriting than the one that precedes it: Kyrgios and Sabalenka spent a half an hour on Tuesday promoting this match on Piers Morgan's show.\n\nThe newsworthy portion of the conversation arrived about halfway through, when Morgan turned to the topic of trans participation in sports. \"Martina Navratilova, a former No. 1 like yourself, says it's wrong for the Women's Tennis Association to allow trans women to compete in its events, do you agree with that?\" Morgan asked. Sabalenka replied:\n\nThat's a tricky question. I have nothing to do against [trans people], but I feel like they still got a huge advantage over the woman, and I think it's just not fair to the woman to basically face biologically a man. It's not fair, the woman been working her whole life to reach her limit, and then she has to face a man, which is biologically much stronger, so for me I don't agree with this kind of stuff in sport.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Kyrgios said that Sabalenka had \"hit the nail on the head.\"\n\nThis is all standard fare that you've heard from anti-trans activists hundreds of times by now, but this particular conversation was made more interesting by where it went next. Immediately after agreeing with Kyrgios and Sabalenka, Morgan brought up an incident from earlier this year when Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostyuk implied that Sabalenka has an advantage over her because of her size and potentially \"higher level of testosterone.\"\n\nHere was an interesting moment. Morgan, totally on accident (he asked this question in order to tee up a punchline built around putting Sabalenka's bikini pictures on screen), had plowed the conversation into a queasy and inconvenient truth that anti-trans agitators refuse to grapple with: In the absence of any actual high-level trans athletes attempting to compete, those who most prominently suffer when trans bans are put into place are cis athletes who do not conform to a particular image of femininity. In other words, if anyone currently on the tour is going to end up being subjected to gross speculation and invasive sex testing under a trans ban, it's players who look like Sabalenka.\n\nNone of this, nor the fact that they had just finished talking about how physical advantages can undermine the competitive fairness of their sport, seemed to enter into Sabalaneka's or Kyrgios's heads as they gave their response about Kostyuk:\n\nSabalenka: All I hear here is just excuses. And it's actually quite funny because she's a strong a girl, she probably has more muscles than I do. She looks fit and strong, and I think that's not the case in all of the matches she lost against top players. Kyrgios: We kind of debunked that. Someone like John Isner or Ivo Karlovi\u0107 was a fair bit bigger than Roger Federer, but that doesn't really\u2014 Morgan: Yeah, you're always going to get physical differences between players, obviously\u2014 Sabalenka: I think that's not the key in sports.\n\nThe most important ingredient in maintaining a commitment to anti-trans bigotry is never stopping to think about anything for more than two seconds.",

I am here to discuss the queer film My Secret Santa, is this the correct place?\n\nSabrina: You are in the right place! Before we dive into the movie, I have to ask. Have either of you ever cross-dressed to commit workplace fraud?\n\nAlex: I really had to sit for a moment and think about it but I\u2019m gonna lean toward no for now.\n\nKelsey: NOT YET! I\u2019m hoping to in the future.\n\nSabrina: 2026 goals! I did not realize when I chose this film that My Secret Santa is essentially a remake of Mrs. Doubtfire except it\u2019s Santa.\n\nKelsey: It also has shades of She\u2019s the Man/Twelfth Night! All the classics of the cross-dressing for employment genre!\n\nSabrina: My Secret Santa opens with our intrepid hero, Taylor Jacobson, getting fired from her job, Fantine-style, which leaves her in dire financial straits. Not only does she need to pay her overdue rent, she also \"needs\" to pay for presumably a very expensive snowboarding school for her daughter Zoey. This was when the movie first fell apart for me. I thought about that dril tweet where someone is like \u201ccan someone help me budget, my family is dying\u201d and it\u2019s like $200 on groceries, $500 on rent, $5,000 on candles. Here, private snowboarding school is candles.\n\nKelsey: One thing I love about movies of this caliber is that you never know what is going to be important. The opening scene of this movie is her very carefully checking decorated cookies for flaws and pulling out the other ones. It\u2019s implied that she\u2019s pretty good at the cookie job and also that she likes it. But guess what? Cookies are not relevant to this movie at all! We never hear about the cookies again! It was all just a job she could lose.\n\nAlex: As the movie went on I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the very first moment in the movie where she picks a Santa cookie out of the lineup and is like, \u201cHe\u2019s depressed!!\u201d That\u2019s called foreshadowing.\n\nKelsey: Also, that Santa cookie looks identical to all the other ones. It\u2019s also called projection.\n\nSabrina: I got where Taylor was coming from, because it seems no one in this small Christmas town has ever seen a therapist, at least one that was not Santa.\n\nKelsey: Don\u2019t be silly, Sabs. You do not need therapy when you have Christmas Spirit.\n\nSabrina: Soooooo true babe. Luckily Taylor has a plan to make some money. She goes to a used record store and tries to sell her collection of vinyl\u2014she only makes $150, which would probably pay for approximately one hour of elite snowboarding school\u2014where she runs into what we are supposed to believe is an alluring eligible bachelor: local hotel heir Matthew Layne.\n\nAlex: It\u2019s moments like these when I fully grasp the width of the chasm between my opinion of a \u201chot man\u201d and Christmas Movie Hot Man. He is fine. The best part about him I think is that he is a huge fan of Screaming Kittens, which turns out to be ... Taylor\u2019s old band?!\n\nKelsey: At this point, the movie has been on for like 15 minutes and there are already so many things happening: old band, potential love interest, snowboarding school, rent problems, fired from job, and also the approach of Christmas, obviously.\n\nAlex: I have this in my notes: \"'You can\u2019t really be a rock star and a mom at the same time' HELL YEAH.\u201d I think I was excited to have the thesis statement spelled out so quickly. I was hoping for a musical performance at some point and I was not disappointed.\n\nSabrina: Matthew asks Taylor out on the traditional adult Christmas date\u2014drinking hot chocolate while leaving room for Jesus\u2014and she cruelly rebuffs him because she cannot be a rock star and a mom and a girlfriend at the same time, obviously.\n\nAlex: Hot chocolate does not exist in the world except for in Christmas movies, but because of this movie I have been craving hot chocolate constantly and I\u2019ve already had it three times.\n\nKelsey: Now, the movie gives us even more plot! The ski resort where Taylor\u2019s daughter has to go to ski school in order to become an Olympic snowboarder(??) even though she is already 16, is a ski resort that is owned by the love interest\u2019s dad. And his dad is mad at him because he already spent so much money crashing his car into a building in Italy(??). So his dad names him the General Manager of the resort, usurping poor Tia Mowry who was in line for the job.\n\nAlex: THRILLING Tia Mowry appearance! This led me down a rabbit hole to confirm that it appears she and Tamara have reconciled in some way so nobody panic.\n\nSabrina: Oh my god, that\u2019s a real Christmas miracle! Twitches lives!! I was pissed off by how this movie treated Tia\u2019s character. She is the only person in this world who got her job without the influence of nepotism, and she seems to be really good at it. Because of this the movie has decided she is an evil careerist mom and therefore the closest this movie comes to a villain.\n\nTaylor learns from her gay brother (more on that later) that the snowboarding tuition is half-off for Sun Peaks employees, so she goes to the hotel to try and get a job. But Tia informs her that the only job they are hiring for is Santa. Alas, Taylor is too beautiful and too female to play Santa!\n\nAlex: It\u2019s at this point that I\u2019m like ... why are you only considering this right now, seemingly two days before this camp starts? If your daughter is this snowboarding savant and you live in this ski town, would this not have come up sooner?? But these movies are not for airtight storytelling. They are the product of someone putting a bunch of nouns and verbs into a hat and covering their eyes as they draw three.\n\nKelsey: I also just do not believe for a second that being Santa at $2000 a week is going to cover half of a snowboarding camp and your rent backlog. Mountain sports are for rich people! And Taylor cannot even pay her rent or get her daughter a new snowboard. Maybe let\u2019s cool it on the snowboarding camp. Or, we as the audience should be given more context about how good Taylor\u2019s daughter is at snowboarding because the way it\u2019s presented in the movie, it seems like she just thinks it\u2019s cool. And unfortunately only rich kids get to do everything they think is cool!\n\nSabrina: Kelsey I was so confused by that. How has her daughter been snowboarding for so long? Has Taylor just been spending 80 percent of her income on snowboarding? Zoey seemed too well-adjusted to be a pro athlete. But fortunately Taylor\u2019s gay brother has a plan: he and his husband will create an elaborate Santa drag disguise for her. This also made no sense financially. The level of detail of the prosthetic Santa mask, the rich velvet of the costume, all of this money could have simply gone to snowboarding school. Or, frankly, to a financial planner for Taylor, to give her the cold hard truth!\n\nAlex: Just to note that I believe Taylor is 100 percent someone who refers to her brother as \u201cmy gay brother\u201d so that is how I\u2019ll be referring to him. Anyway, somehow her gay brother has all the supplies and technology to make professional-level prosthetics for the face and body.\n\nSabrina: When you\u2019re gay they teach you that in gay school, I think.\n\nKelsey: I did really like the Mission: Impossible sequence where they scanned her head with a 3-D scanner and then printed a new face for her as Santa which the gay brother and gay brother-in-law then painted to look realistic. They filled the Santa belly with lentils. Iconique.\n\nAlex: The mask they make is absolutely terrifying. The final product is \u2026 kind of convincing? Through the screen? But I have a hard time believing it wouldn\u2019t feel uncanny valley up close, so that was in the back of my mind the rest of the movie whenever she was in Santa\u2014or rather, Hugh Mann\u2014costume.\n\nSabrina: The mask clearly works on Hotel Heir Matthew and General Manager Tia, because they hire Taylor as Santa. She tells them her name is Hugh \u2026 Mann. This raised many questions for me. How did she not think ahead to come up with a fake name? What on earth does her W2 look like?\n\nKelsey: What kind of passport did she submit!! The Santa job should be cash under the table anyway, in my opinion.\n\nAlex: Mr. Mann!!! It feels like a drag performance at this point. And the gender excitement just keeps going because then she takes a call in the women\u2019s bathroom thinking it\u2019s empty, but of course a toilet flushes and an old lady comes out. The tone is very Ha ha! It\u2019s a man in the women\u2019s bathroom! Isn\u2019t that silly?!\n\nSabrina: Yeah I refuse to engage with or even imagine this movie\u2019s perspective on trans politics. But the next bathroom Taylor finds herself in is a steamy one. She is led by Chief Elf Jimmy to the men\u2019s locker room to change into her Santa fit, where she runs into a nude Matthew Layne. What proceeds is maybe the most homoerotic scene of the movie\u2019s many homoerotic scenes. Midway through dressing, Matthew asks Taylor-as-Hugh to tie his tie for him. I genuinely thought they were going to bone, or something close to it.\n\nAlex: When Matthew Layne is gazing into Hugh Mann\u2019s eyes and saying he just feels like he can talk to him \u2026 wow, it was a truly romantic moment.\n\nKelsey: To me, it is beautiful that the sexual chemistry between Matthew and Taylor exists even when she is dressed in a giant Santa suit. I love love. What I do not love is that one of the clues the movie plants that Hugh Mann is Taylor is a kind of chapstick that has a unicorn head on the top of it that we are supposed to believe Taylor uses all the time.\n\nSabrina: Honestly I felt like the only times Matthew and Taylor had chemistry is when she was in character as Hugh Mann. Maybe it has to do with the way \u201cstraight\u201d men are able to be intimate in a \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d way in these movies that a heterosexual couple simply cannot. But I was genuinely titillated by the Daddy-Son dynamic between them, and I couldn\u2019t help but fantasize about another Christmas movie where the real Santa finds love in a locker room.\n\nKelsey: No, you\u2019re totally right. There was almost no chemistry when Taylor was dressed as herself. I think part of that is because her character description was mainly \u201cuptight\u201d and \u201cscared.\u201d\n\nAlex: And also when she is Hugh Mann, she is also daddy, which is what Matthew desperately needs.\n\nSabrina: Holy shit. Yes. Yes!!!\n\nKelsey: WOW! Freud! It all makes sense. He just wants to get a drink with his dad and be loved by him.\n\nSabrina: I\u2019m reeling.\n\nAlex: I\u2019m gonna be honest, this is the point in the movie where I wrote \u201cit\u2019s giving mulan\u201d and my notes ended because I was hootin and hollerin at the TV. Speeding through the plot though, Hugh becomes the resort\u2019s Santa and is really bad at it at first because she\u2019s too practical, and then she has a heart to heart with Matthew at a bar.\n\nKelsey: My notes at this point say FLAMING CANDY CANES. Because I was very excited by the drink that is brought out to Matthew and Hugh Mann that has crushed candy canes on the side of it and some kind of floating flammable topper shot. No one drinks these because they light Hugh Mann\u2019s beard on fire, but I liked seeing them.\n\nSabrina: After Taylor tries to give a pep talk to her daughter (while dressed as Santa), Zoey tells Santa that all she wants for Christmas is for her mom to get a boyfriend. This changes Taylor\u2019s whole approach to being Santa from being uptight and practical to becoming a kind of therapist to the many children who wish for something less material than presents.\n\nKelsey: More good evidence in my opinion that we should not be risking our life\u2019s savings on snowboarding school!! Your Christmas wish is for your mom to have a boyfriend?\n\nAlex: Also, just a small note on the topic of Taylor\u2019s financial literacy: I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s wearing a Canada Goose coat in one scene?!? Those are like $1000???\n\nSabrina: And I feel like that\u2019s still less expensive than this Santa drag getup! Which, by the way, has already been repaired twice after the fire incident, and another incident when an overzealous child bursts Hugh Mann\u2019s belly leading him to gush lentils like a burst artery. This was a fun bit of body horror for me, imagining a kind of man who is made of lentils. But soon we come to what was, for me, the absolute worst part of the movie. A young girl who stutters comes up to Hugh Mann and says her Christmas wish is to not stutter anymore, and then Hugh Mann tells her that stuttering can be fixed with the power of song, and then they all sing \u201cJingle Bells\u201d together (in my opinion the worst Christmas song!) and the girl doesn\u2019t stutter and her mom tells her she\u2019s proud of her and the moment goes viral on the internet and this is all used as evidence that Matthew has now become good at general managing a hotel.\n\nKelsey: I hated this part, to be honest. Although, it did lead me to googling whether or not singing helps stuttering and apparently it does help. Also the website it goes viral on is called \"HAPPENED.\" We see it on a computer screen.\n\nSabrina: That reminds me of when Tia Mowry is doing investigative journalism on Hugh Mann and looks him up on a search engine called \u201cLook Path\u201d and then again on a website called \u201cJobization.\u201d I had fun imagining what terrible tech billionaires ruled over this world of Christmas.\n\nAlex: I could tell we were on the path toward a zany party scene where both Taylor and Hugh are invited and expected to make appearances, and I was impatient to get there.\n\nSabrina: The party where Hugh and Taylor both have to be there is a good bit of fun. She has to run back and forth to the bathroom to change in and out of Santa drag with the help of her gay brother, who is also really hungry for some reason? Why didn\u2019t he eat before this?\n\nKelsey: I was dying at the hunger subplot. Why are you so hungry? Why do you want your sister-in-law who is clearly in crisis to bring you weird catered food from upstairs! Just wait!\n\nAlex: And this is where we get an explicitly implied gay sex scene in the bathroom because Matthew walks in and hears Taylor and gay brother grunting and banging on walls as they tried to get her fat suit on, and then Hugh walks out and it\u2019s like\u2026\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nSabrina: I was pleasantly surprised by Matthew\u2019s reaction to hearing what could only have been gay sex in the bathroom of his hotel lobby. He reacted like an ally! Or even a man who might be interested in trying some of that himself!\n\nAlex: I have to imagine that Matthew was at least a little bit curious!!! Given everything he\u2019s going through!!!\n\nKelsey: And also when it was revealed to be his man-crush Hugh Mann who was in there making these sounds, he was very professional and kind. Matthew is an ally.\n\nAlex: By this point, Tia has figured out a connection between Hugh and Taylor because she realized that Hugh had filled out his paperwork with her Social Security number, and she\u2019s like \u201ccheckmate to my nemesis.\u201d She wants to be the general manager of the resort and she thinks exposing Hugh will make Matthew look bad and secure the promotion for her. Which is incredibly misguided because when does sabotaging someone over an opportunity you were already passed over for work out in your favor? Also, these people think and talk about general managers so much more than anyone, ever.\n\nSabrina: After Tia accuses Taylor in front of the party, Taylor is feeling cornered. I thought she was going to do a Mission: Impossible unmasking, ripping off her Santa face and spraying the room with lentils, but then a hotel employee runs in asking for Taylor, because her daughter Zoey had a snowboarding accident. This stressed me out so much because presumably Sun Peaks is not offering their seasonal employee Hugh Mann health insurance??\n\nKelsey: God I wish the lentils had made a comeback!\n\nAlex: I do not ski for many reasons but chief among them is the risk of catastrophic injury, and when Zoey is on a stretcher with her neck in a neck brace I thought it was going to be so much worse than what turned out to be a sprained arm?\n\nSabrina: Yeah they really bait-and-switched us! When I saw the neck brace I was prepared for a worst-case scenario, and then like two scenes later she just is wearing a sling.\n\nKelsey: Insane that there was no concern about health insurance when she took a part-time job to pay for snowboarding school! I did really enjoy the scene though where Taylor forgets she is dressed as Santa and is comforting her injured daughter who is \u2026 so confused about why Santa is there.\n\nSabrina: That\u2019s finally when Hugh Mann unmasks to reveal himself as Taylor, leaving everyone shocked, but Matthew overall seemed pretty chill about it, which I appreciated. Taylor was like, I can explain! And Matthew was like, Your daughter is in a neck brace, which is more important than our situationship. I was a little confused why everyone was so mad about Taylor being Santa. Obviously it\u2019s not a good idea to have hired someone to work with children without doing a background check first, and employment fraud is probably bad, probably? But also I feel like there must be gender discrimination in the Santa industry, and would Taylor have been hired if she had been honest about being a woman?\n\nAlex: Yeah, if this happened in real life, in no universe does the heat come down on the beloved resort Santa. This is a local newspaper investigation into the hiring practices of the resort and how there are no background checks done.\n\nSabrina: This is where I have to be honest and say that the first evening I sat down and tried to watch this movie, I paused after 15 minutes to watch my favorite Christmas-adjacent movie of all time, Spotlight. It was a really good decision. And I returned to My Secret Santa when I had a more open, patient heart.\n\nUltimately Taylor and Matthew reconcile at some kind of unveiling with the same \u201cbig crowd\u201d of 20 extras who appear in every single crowd shot. She decides to walk on stage as Matthew is announcing something and then apologizes, and then Matthew finally admits that he was feeling sexual feelings toward Santa. I wish they had been able to have this conversation in private so that Taylor, as the sister of a gay brother, might have been able to shepherd him toward an understanding of his queerness. But no, they had to reconcile in front of a crowd so that everyone could clap when they kissed and then sing a \u201cpunk\u201d rendition of \"Run Rudolph Run\" that I simply do not believe was punk.\n\nKelsey: As a sister of a gay brother, you would think she would try harder! I agree!\n\nAlex: He does admit he misses Hugh, which makes me believe that there\u2019s room for this relationship to evolve with time.\n\nSabrina: That\u2019s right, Taylor, it\u2019s never too late to transition!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe movie closes with everyone at a Christmas party together smiling laughing whatever. Boring! Let Matthew kiss Hugh on his wizened old lips! Do you feel like you learned any lessons from this movie?\n\nAlex: I learned that it is impossible to be a present parent and also be successful at your career so you gotta choose one. Classic!\n\nKelsey: A lesson I learned is to never fill your fake belly with only lentils if it is not double lined. You need the lentils to be secure. What lessons did you learn?\n\nSabrina: I learned the lesson of Mamma Mia, which is that you should always tell your daughter about the band you were in when you were younger because it fosters a genuine and lasting connection between the two of you that can also help transfer intergenerational wisdom about financial planning (in this case from Zoey to Taylor). And I learned to never do winter sports without health insurance.",

      "full_content": "Are we as sure as we think we are that Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua has filled his school's institutional diaper by carrying on about the Fighting Irish being excluded from the college football playoff? Or is this just college football fans, and mostly those from the lower right quadrant of the nation, shrieking in glee at said diaper and its owner?\n\nWe're not exactly sure, to be honest, although it says something about the tone of it all that the metaphorical diaper is a constant. Despite its ongoing consolidation into sprawling gigaconferences, college football has never been a more regional sport than it is now, and a large part of the nation that's still invested in the whole Ponzi scheme likes the fact that everyone involved is pantloading in a frantically public way. As big a deal as Notre Dame football is\u2014and it is a big deal, if not quite as big a deal as it believes itself to be\u2014this is more about the chance to giggle and gawk at an embarrassing public spectacle than it is anything to do with the game itself.\n\nBut here we are anyway, on Day 4 of a two-day story, with Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark chastising Bevacqua for complaining about ACC commissioner Jim Phillips' inertia re: the ACC social media team's frantic promotion for the playoff candidacy of full member Miami instead of part member Notre Dame. That's a lot to follow, a proper pigpile of socially arrested suits moaning and groaning about each other. They are upset because their entire system is a Jenga tower wrapped in money and coated in maple syrup; they are complaining because that's more or less their raison d'etre.\n\nNotre Dame has always been an easy target for such fans and opponents because of the advantages it has blackjacked into being. Those include being an independent in the program's most lucrative sport and a conference member in all the others; having its own network; and the recent discovery that they can be grandfathered into the 2026 playoff simply by being ranked in the top 12 by the nitwit-powered playoff committee. Notre Dame is entitled because they are Notre Dame, but it is more salient in this case that the system has re-entitled them. As a result, Notre Dame when wronged is particularly squeally, and those who don't like them for those privileges (read: the rest of College Football America) will naturally be inclined to soak their feet in the bucket of Notre Dame's tears.\n\nBut if it were just that, we could all move on to some other seasonal gripe\u2014the fact that inflatable front yard Santas are not only a thing but a thing that costs $200, maybe. It isn't just that, though. College football is no longer about either college or football. It's certainly not about the players, who used to be student-athletes but now are working their way toward the drinking-age hell of being employees. College football is about itself, and more specifically about the act of consuming itself\u2014about being shouty about something or someone. We suspect that Bevacqua knows this in his way, just as the committee knew it in their context, and Lane Kiffin knew about it in his uniquely hyper-solipsistic way, and LSU knew it when it fired Brian Kelly, then unfired him so they could avoid paying him, then lost their interest in unfiring him when they found out they'd have to pay him anyway and fired him again. You can see this knowledge, which is cynical and sure and absolutely ice cold, in the way that coaches were being fired weekly for Snickers and giggles all season, and in USC and Michigan complaining that Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti is seeking out hedge fund operators to fuel college sports. Everyone knows their respective advantage and what they can get away with, and everyone is pressing their luck.\n\nIt's all adult-on-adult behavior, and the one thing youth culture has always gotten right is how utterly contemptible adults are when left to their own reflections. Commissioners? Athletic directors? Coaches? Hedge funds? How much closer to the bottom of the latrine are we this year than last?\n\nWhatever that distance, this is what college football wants to be now, and so we must presume what it will continue to be. People even hate the comparatively charming presences of Tulane and James Madison in the playoff as the business' last offering to the 100-some-odd schools left out of the SEC/Big Ten appropriation of the levers of power. Those people will likely be proven right, if annoying, when Tulane gets boatraced (again) by the de-Kiffinized Ole Miss and JMU gets pounded by Oregon. Those adults will complain about the playoff format for five days while the Tulane and JMU coaches flit off to their next jobs, and then everyone will get back to the bidness of bidness.\n\nWith all that as the backdrop, Notre Dame re-galvanizing the industry's Pavlovian hate against itself may actually be brilliant if self-parodic theatre, a reminder that, even in this churning mosh pit of soul-deficient moneygrubbers, there is one thing they can all agree upon. We prefer to think, then, that Pete Bevacqua saw the business tearing itself apart and imposed the power incumbent in his office as Chief Petty Officer Of The U.S.S. Fighting Irish to remind everyone of the one thing they can all agree upon\u2014hating Notre Dame for being so relentlessly, persistently and shamelessly Notre Dame. Bevacqua's sacrifice should be hailed as what it is, a brave act of falling on the grenade to save the rest of the platoon. The only real quibble we have is why anyone would bother to take one for this platoon, even or especially when it all just feels like friendly fire.",

So when a detestable invertebrate was once again dropped without warning into my plastic box, when I heard its loathsome little wings battering the acrylic walls, I turned around without hesitation and opened my mouth to swallow the minibeast. After weeks of mealworms, I was ready for flavor and prepared for significant bodily harm. O wretched ambrosial bug, come into my mouth!\n\nShinji Sugiura\n\nWhen I opened my eyes to see my meal, horror coursed through the cold blood of my veins. I am no stranger to pain. I had survived the barbed penes of the mason wasp and the pestilential nectar of the bombardier beetle. But now I faced a nemesis I feared I could not vanquish. Time wavered as I realized that I now looked upon the northern giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia. Had I not been so hungry, I would have bowed my head in reverence to such a creature. This is the beast some call the murder hornet.\n\nWhat a predicament I have inflicted upon myself! Shinji Sugiura\n\nVerily, good reader, I had heard the horror stories. How its stinger slices through the dense barrier of a beekeeping suit as if it were nothing more than silk. How it slays four score bees a minute, decapitating each worker head by puny head. How a single prick of its venom can kill a mouse. How might the life of a mouse measure up to that of of a frog? The odds, I reasoned, were not in my favor. I thought I had stared Death in his wizened face before, felt his stale breath waft over my mortal soul, but I know now I had never been in any real danger. The mason wasp and bombardier beetle were mere hurdles, a way to test my thirst for the spice of life. But this, it dawned on me, would be my final test. Was this lonely frog ready to die?\n\nO Death, am I ready for your sweet embrace? Shinji Sugiura\n\nOf course I contemplated spitting out the hornet, wrenching it from my lips with the suctioned pads of my forelimbs. Yet my mouth rudely ignored my mind; my jaws clamped together as the creature thrashed in my throat. I thought of many things in these precious seconds that preceded the pain. I thought of my almost-love, my almost-killer. I thought of my youth in Honshu, whose green fields I remember only in dreams. Was it still my homeland, or had my home become this plastic cube? Had the fluorescent overhead lighting become my new sun, and these large-fingered scientists my pantheon of gods? 'Twould not be so bad to die like this, I reasoned, among the closest thing a frog has got to family. No need to mend a broken heart if it stops beating entirely. And so I waited, hornet in my jaws, thinking of my father\u2014had I ever met him, and did he look like me?\u2014and felt the Dreaded Puncture of my supper's stinger slicing through my flesh. Farewell, brutish world!\n\nCome, Reaper, I am ready for your embrace! Shinji Sugiura\n\nI waited, and waited, and waited, and as I waited this dastardly hornet stung me once more on my lip, and then my throat and face, and finally, my eyeball. This is when I began pleading with Death to come more expeditiously. Come Charon, here is my coin! Let me hop with the shades! Through my stung eye, I looked beyond the walls of my box to see if any of my fellow frogs bore witness to my expiration. But none spared me a second glance. My comrades were each in their boxes, munching on hornets of their own, and looking invariably unperturbed. What was the meaning of this? Were we not all put on Earth to die, put specifically in this laboratory to be murdered by way of hornet?\n\nAnd then I swallowed the hornet and felt fine. A cold sheen seeped from my mucus membrane as I realized that I was, against every expectation, going to live. (This also surprised the scientists.)\n\nFrog who is \"going to be okay.\" Shinji Sugiura\n\nIn that moment I understood the devil with which I had danced. I had almost given up the most precious gift a frog can have, because of what, exactly? Some failed romance? I was a fool to search for happiness in others before I could first find happiness in myself.\n\nI may be a frog alone in the world, but this is not such a tragedy. I have my two strong hindlimbs for hopping, my two dexterous forelimbs for pushing giant, wriggling hornets down my gullet. I have eyes that can see despite being repeatedly stung. I have a mind and a soul, one no more or less significant than any of the other beings around me in this lab. I have a story, which I am not ready to end. I am not ready to croak. Bring it on, life, give me more! Give me more taste, more experiences. Give me the moon and the stars! Give me more joy, more love, even more heartache, I am ready for it all! Whatever the webbed fingers of the heavens may throw at me next, I will open my mouth wide to guzzle the rapture and the pain, to be changed by what will change me. You know what I'm getting at. Another hornet, good sir!",

The Penguins took 47 shots to Anaheim's 28, had five power plays to the Ducks' one, enjoyed 80 percent of the game's high-danger scoring chances, and generally broke the Deserve To Win O'Meter. Yet it was the Ducks who came away with two points\u2014duck, duck, deuce?\u2014for they enjoy the inscrutable blessings of fate and physics.\n\nIt took a pair of miracles to get there, but that's simply the way the puck bounces when things are going good. The first came at the end of regulation\u2014the very, very end. 19:59.9 of the third period, to be precise, when the Ducks, down a goal, down a man but with their goalie pulled, skated in on a Pens defense that looked fairly prepared for the desperation attempt. But rookie Beckett Sennecke was allowed a shocking amount of room to maneuver on net (play the man, not the puck!) and attempted a short pass across the goalmouth that, had things gone according to Sennecke's plan, would have seen time expire. \"I wasn\u2019t really keeping track of the time,\u201d Sennecke admitted.\n\nBut the pass bounced off the hand of a sprawled Erik Karlsson and in, with 0.1 showing on the clock.\n\n\"It hit my hand and went in. There was no question about it,\u201d Karlsson said. \u201cHow it came to be that way, I don't really know.\" Yes! Join me in freeing yourself from the shackles of causality! This is the NHL in December, where nothing makes sense and nothing really matters. The Pens are an inexplicable 1-7 on games that make it to overtime? Sure, why not. The Ducks are 19-10-1, and have won three straight despite being down to their third and fourth goaltenders? Tell another one.\n\nVille Husso, said third-string netminder, is on a very Ducklike heater, in that he's winning game after game despite not playing a very good goal. He's allowed three or more goals in four of six starts since stepping in for the injured Lukas Dostal and Petr Mrazek, and he's 5-1 in those games. A representative bit of Husso magic came in overtime, when Sidney Crosby along the goal line pushed a lovely pass out to Tommy Novak in the opposite circle for the one-timer. An off-balance Husso reached out with his stick ... and didn't get anywhere near it.\n\nIt's tough to see, even on replays, but Novak's shot hit the post and rode up Husso's stick, and he deposited it in an only slightly less dangerous part of the crease, until it was fortuitously cleared away. I'm not sure Husso really did anything here, let alone earned the \"save of the year\" caption, but all that ultimately matters is straightforward enough to be described to a caveman, and puck no go in.\n\nLeo Carlsson's first-round shootout goal stood up, as Husso added three more stops to go with his 44 saves.\n\nHusso has likened the Ducks' hot start\u2014and we're past a third of the way through the season, so this is more than a fluke\u2014to the Blues' Stanley Cup run he enjoyed from the bench in 2019. \"I feel like there\u2019s a lot of similar stuff happening here. The atmosphere and everything. The rink is buzzing. Fans are excited. Everything is just like clicking.\" Do not underestimate the power of buzzing and clicking. Something weird and fun is happening here.\n\n",

      "full_content": "How dare you. That was the joint response from Muslim-majority Egypt and Iran, two Middle East nations where homosexuality is illegal, venting their fury Tuesday that FIFA has scheduled a 2026 World Cup soccer match in Seattle that overlaps LGBTQI+ Pride events.\n\nThe fixture on June 26 next year has been designated by local organisers as a \u201cPride Match\u201d to coincide with Seattle\u2019s Pride weekend, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nEgypt and Iran are now furiously protesting because that cause affronts their Islamic sensibilities alongside \u201cthe cultural and social values\u201d they hold.\n\nEgypt\u2019s soccer federation issued a statement late Tuesday saying it sent a letter to FIFA \u201ccategorically rejecting any activities related to supporting homosexuality during the match.\u201d\n\nSeattle PrideFest has been organized in the city since 2007 by a nonprofit which designated the June 26 game for celebration before FIFA made the World Cup draw Friday, AP reports.\n\nFIFA chose Saturday to allocate the Egypt-Iran game to Seattle instead of Vancouver, where the teams\u2019 group rivals Belgium and New Zealand will play at the same time.\n\n\u201cWith matches on Juneteenth and pride, we get to show the world that in Seattle, everyone is welcome,\u201d Seattle\u2019s Mayor-elect Kate Wilson wrote on social media. \u201cWhat an incredible honor!\u201d\n\nThe AP report notes FIFA controls only stadiums and official fan zones in World Cup host cities and should have no formal authority over community events like Seattle PrideFest.\n\nIn Iran, where gays and lesbians can face the death penalty, the president of Iran\u2019s Football Federation Mehdi Taj attacked the match during an interview aired on state television.\n\nTaj said Iran would bring up the issue during a FIFA Council meeting in Qatar next week. The longest-serving member of the 37-person council chaired by FIFA President Gianni Infantino is Egypt\u2019s Hany Abo Rida.\n\n\u201cBoth Egypt and we have objected, because this is an unreasonable and illogical move that essentially signals support for a particular group, and we must definitely address this point,\u201d Taj said. State TV on Tuesday confirmed a complaint would be sent to FIFA.\n\nThe Egypt soccer federation led by Ado Rida said of the pride events it \u201ccompletely rejects such activities, which directly contradict the cultural, religious and social values in the region, especially in Arab and Islamic societies.\u201d\n\nThe 2026 World Cup is set to be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026.\n\nRead the AP report in full here",

But it's a losing battle, you're not going to be able to change American football to another name.\"\u00a0</p><p>One thing that both Jones and Badji believe can be feasibly addressed in the U.S. by the time the World Cup begins is fan behavior during games.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/iran-boycotting-2026-world-cup-draw-ceremony-washington-due-denied-visas-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>IRAN BOYCOTTING 2026 WORLD CUP DRAW CEREMONY IN WASHINGTON DUE TO DENIED VISAS BY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\u00a0</strong></a></p><p>In 2025 alone, soccer matches across the world have been sites of violent fan behavior.\u00a0</p><p>Just this month at a game for the French club OGC France, players and staff were assaulted, spat on and punched by their own supporters after a loss, and a man in the U.K. was charged with racially abusing Bournemouth player Antoine Semenyo during a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer/premier-league\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Premier League match</a> against Liverpool.\u00a0</p><p>\"The biggest thing is the fan behavior,\" Jones said. \"It's important that the adults are displaying proper behavior for the kids that are becoming adults.\"</p><p>Jones added of the upcoming World Cup, \"There's going to be a lot of people from a lot of different cultures, so I'm sure there's going to be some clashes, but I think it's going to be a great chance as well to celebrate each other's differences and learn about each other's cultures.</p><p>\"Security will be important, and you want to make sure that it's a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/travel-safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">safe environment</a> for everyone, and everyone can just enjoy the games and get home safely.\"\u00a0</p><p>Badji said he is disappointed with the behavior of fans at <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer/major-league-soccer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MLS games</a> \"all the time.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"People flipping you off, people saying slurs to you, I unfortunately have had racial slurs thrown at me. I've heard other slurs thrown at other people, so it's unfortunate,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Badji said one of his biggest hopes and goals of the upcoming World Cup is to \"getting rid of some of the ignorance that comes with not knowing the cultures of different countries.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Soccer will bring people together that might not speak the same language,\" Badji, later adding, \"Politics are so heavily involved in soccer that sometimes it sways the way people perceive other people, other teams, other countries\"</p><p>It is a topic that Badji and Jones spoke about at the \"Three Nations, One Game: North America\u2019s Role in Shaping Global Sportsmanship,\" panel at the Ronald Reagan Institute's Center on Civility and Democracy (CCD) in <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">downtown Washington, D.C.</a>, on Dec. 2.

But he is also aware of American football's cultural dominance.</p><p>\"By calling it football here, you're competing with the biggest sport in the country\u2026 I think it should be football, because that's what the rest of the world calls it,\" Badji told Fox News Digital.\u00a0</p><p>\"When you talk about <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. soccer</a>, you're trying to get up to speed with the rest of the world, and it's just a little barrier in soccer-football, but ultimately I think it should be called football. But it's a losing battle, you're not going to be able to change American football to another name.\"\u00a0</p><p>One thing that both Jones and Badji believe can be feasibly addressed in the U.S. by the time the World Cup begins is fan behavior during games.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/iran-boycotting-2026-world-cup-draw-ceremony-washington-due-denied-visas-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>IRAN BOYCOTTING 2026 WORLD CUP DRAW CEREMONY IN WASHINGTON DUE TO DENIED VISAS BY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\u00a0</strong></a></p><p>In 2025 alone, soccer matches across the world have been sites of violent fan behavior.\u00a0</p><p>Just this month at a game for the French club OGC France, players and staff were assaulted, spat on and punched by their own supporters after a loss, and a man in the U.K. was charged with racially abusing Bournemouth player Antoine Semenyo during a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer/premier-league\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Premier League match</a> against Liverpool.\u00a0</p><p>\"The biggest thing is the fan behavior,\" Jones said. \"It's important that the adults are displaying proper behavior for the kids that are becoming adults.\"</p><p>Jones added of the upcoming World Cup, \"There's going to be a lot of people from a lot of different cultures, so I'm sure there's going to be some clashes, but I think it's going to be a great chance as well to celebrate each other's differences and learn about each other's cultures.</p><p>\"Security will be important, and you want to make sure that it's a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/travel-safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">safe environment</a> for everyone, and everyone can just enjoy the games and get home safely.\"\u00a0</p><p>Badji said he is disappointed with the behavior of fans at <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer/major-league-soccer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MLS games</a> \"all the time.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"People flipping you off, people saying slurs to you, I unfortunately have had racial slurs thrown at me. I've heard other slurs thrown at other people, so it's unfortunate,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>Badji said one of his biggest hopes and goals of the upcoming World Cup is to \"getting rid of some of the ignorance that comes with not knowing the cultures of different countries.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Soccer will bring people together that might not speak the same language,\" Badji, later adding, \"Politics are so heavily involved in soccer that sometimes it sways the way people perceive other people, other teams, other countries\"</p><p>It is a topic that Badji and Jones spoke about at the \"Three Nations, One Game: North America\u2019s Role in Shaping Global Sportsmanship,\" panel at the Ronald Reagan Institute's Center on Civility and Democracy (CCD) in <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/washington-dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">downtown Washington, D.C.</a>, on Dec. 2. They delivered their speeches alongside Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., and Andrew Giuliani, executive director of the White House\u2019s FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force.\u00a0</p><p>CCD Director Fred Ryan told Fox News Digital he believes that even more than the fans, the players are accountable for showing respect on the field in order to promote a peaceful environment.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's been a few disappointing things from time to time, there's an athlete on the field who does not show respect for their opponent or rules of the game or the referee,\" Ryan said. \"On the field, we want to applaud good sportsmanship, we want to applaud people who respect their opponent\u2026 and people who respect the rules of the game.\"\u00a0</p><p>For Jones, one of his avenues for maintaining respect and promoting unity as a player on the field is by <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">channeling his devotion to Jesus Christ</a>.</p><p>\"I believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins and every day, honestly, when I'm reading my Bible and praying and definitely before I step onto the pitch, I just ask for the lord to protect me and to guide me when I'm out there,\" Jones said.\u00a0</p><p>\"One of the biggest things Jesus teaches is just to love your neighbor as yourself\u2026 I think a lot of times in society, people are looking out for themselves, and whatever gets them ahead but if we all just had a little bit more empathy and looked to our neighbors and see what we could do to help instead of always get something and receiving\u2026 I think that would go a long way in making the world more peaceful.\"\u00a0</p><p><i>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong><u>sports coverage on X</u></strong></i></a><i>, and subscribe to\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong><u>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</u></strong></i></a><i>.</i></p>",

      "full_content": "Their team lost.\n\nEight teen football players from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were arrested on theft charges in Florida after being caught in a brazen \"conspiracy\" to steal thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise from a Dick's Sporting Goods. The juvenile suspects had traveled to Polk County, Florida, to participate in the Prolifix Nationals tournament at the time of their apprehensions.\n\n\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) said in a press release that the incident occurred just hours before the teens were scheduled to participate in the championship game. They were handcuffed instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 10:55 am on December 6, a store manager at the Dick's Sporting Goods in Davenport contacted the sheriff's office \"after observing multiple juveniles concealing merchandise.\" PCSO deputies arrived on scene and detained all eight football players.According to authorities, the suspects split into two groups to carry out the conspiracy. Marcus Hudgens, 15, made a purchase near the front of the store and then approached his teammates, who were walking around inside. Hudgens opened his Dick's Sporting Goods bag, and the other suspects placed merchandise inside it.Daimon Johnson, 15, Mark Bryan, 15, and Ibn Mahdee Abdul Haqq, 14, then exited the store with the bag full of stolen merchandise. They were arrested upon exit. Abdul-Haqq allegedly had stolen merchandise concealed inside a black backpack, while Bryan was in possession of the bag from the store that consisted of more than $2,000 worth of stolen goods. The other five suspects were detained inside the store. This included Hudgens, Elijah Myers, 14, Tymir Speller, 15, Tymir Smith, 14, and Jacob Scott, 15. Authorities discovered a beanie hidden inside Speller's pants when he was detained, according to the press release.Photo Polk County Sheriff's OfficeThe eight teens were identified as members of the United Thoroughbreds, a youth football team located in Philadelphia. The total value of stolen merchandise totaled $2,296.07.\"These juveniles were not from Polk County, they came here from Philly for a football tournament, and instead of representing their team with pride, they chose to steal - they are Thoroughbred thieves,\" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who shamed the players in a press conference. \"Let this be clear: it doesn't matter if you're from here or visiting, if you break the law in Polk County, you will be arrested and held accountable.\"The team's coach, Raekwon Bynes, 29, responded to the store and confirmed to authorities that the teens were staying in Davenport for the championship game, the sheriff's office said. The eight suspects had no prior criminal histories and declined to provide statements to authorities. The players were transported to the Juvenile Assessment Center, and each was charged with retail theft and conspiracy to commit retail theft.Sheriff Judd congratulated the opposing team for defeating the Thoroughbreds in the championship game, stating that the Coco Tigers didn't just win but \"ran over them.\" The Thoroughbreds lost the game 26-6.",

      "content": "<div class=\"FeatureByline\">\n           By <b>Joe Brockmeier</b><br>December 10, 2025</br>\n           </div>\n<p>Linux containers have made it reasonably easy to develop, distribute, and\ndeploy server applications along with all the distribution dependencies that they\nneed. For example, anyone can deploy and run a Debian-based <a\nhref=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres\">PostgreSQL container</a> \non a Fedora&#160;Linux host. <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/\">Distrobox</a> is a project that is designed to\nbring the cross-distribution compatibility to the desktop and allow users to\nmix-and-match Linux distributions without fussing with dual-booting, virtual\nmachines, or multiple computers. It is an ideal way to install\nadditional software on image-based systems, such as Fedora's <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/\">Atomic Desktops</a>\nor <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1046228/\">Bazzite</a>, and also\nprovides a convenient way to move a development environment or\nfavorite applications to a new system.</p>\n\n<p>Distrobox creator Luca Di Maio <a\nhref=\"https://fedoramagazine.org/run-distrobox-on-fedora-linux/\">was\ninspired</a> by the <a href=\"https://containertoolbx.org/doc/\">Toolbx</a>\nproject (formerly Container Toolbox) for Fedora. Generally, the idea with Linux\ncontainers is to run processes in their own environment to isolate them as much\nas possible from the host without having to resort to virtual machines\nwith their additional overhead. It is possible, though, to set up a container to give it privileged\naccess to the system with little to no isolation. This is typically referred to\nas a <a\nhref=\"https://www.baeldung.com/linux/privileged-container-capabilities#privileged-containers\">privileged\ncontainer</a>.\nIt is possible to set up privileged containers manually, but it requires the\nuser to know a great deal about working with containers and some fairly involved\nsetup. The original goal for Toolbx was to let users run a privileged container\n\"toolbox\" on image-based systems that could be used for system administration\nand troubleshooting without having to include administration utilities in the\nimage itself.</p>\n\n<p>Toolbx has a somewhat limited scope: it works best with specific container images and was primarily developed to provide a software toolbox for\nimage-based Fedora editions like <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/\">CoreOS</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/\">Silverblue</a>. Toolbx is also\nlimited to the <a href=\"https://podman.io/\">Podman</a> container manager, which\nis not ideal for those who prefer to use <a\nhref=\"https://www.docker.com/get-started/\">Docker</a>. Di Maio wanted to have\nbroader compatibility with other Linux distributions as host operating systems\nas well as the ability to use a wide range of container images. He published the\nfirst release, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.0.0\">Distrobox&#160;1.0.0</a>,\nin December&#160;2021, under the GPLv3.</p>\n\n<p>The Distrobox project is, as its homepage notes, \"<q>a fancy\nwrapper</q>\" that works with Docker and Podman, with di Maio's own minimal\ncontainer manager, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/lilipod?tab=readme-ov-file#lilipod\">Lilipod</a>,\nas a fallback if the others are not present. Distrobox is written in POSIX\nshell, so that it is as portable as possible. The <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#aims\">project's\nprimary goal</a> is to allow the use of any Linux distribution containers on any\nLinux distribution host running one of the supported container managers. It also\nhas a goal of entering a container as quickly as possible, \"<q>every millisecond\nadds up if you use the container as your default environment for your\nterminal</q>\".</p>\n\n<p>Di&#160;Maio notes in the project's README that isolation and\nsandboxing of applications are non-goals: \"<q>on the contrary it aims\nto tightly integrate the container with the host</q>\". This means that\ncontainers run by Distrobox have access to the user's home directory, external\nstorage, USB devices, audio devices, and more. The idea of a sandboxed\nmode for Distrobox <a href=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28\">was\ndiscussed</a> but di&#160;Maio ultimately <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28#issuecomment-2408529939\">decided\nagainst</a> implementing one and has <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/pull/1806#issuecomment-3219301182\">opted\nnot to take patches</a> attempting to add isolation features: \"<q>the focus of\ndistrobox is not isolation, security or stuff, but integration and transparency\nwith the host</q>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\n\n<p>Distrobox is packaged for most popular Linux distributions, and the project\nhas a <a href=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#host-distros\">compatibility\ntable of host distributions</a> for those it has been tested on. The table \nhas notes with additional instructions if necessary. There is a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#containers-distros\">table of guest\ndistributions</a> as well that lists the container images that have been successfully\ntested with Distrobox. If a distribution is not mentioned in the host or guest\ntable it does not mean that Distrobox will not work; it simply indicates that\nthe combinations have not been tested. Users will also need one of the supported\ncontainer managers installed as well.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of how and why one might use Distrobox: the <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/#signal\">Signal</a> project only provides <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/download/linux/\">packages for Debian-based\ndistributions</a>, so there are no official packages for Arch, Fedora, openSUSE,\nor other non-Debian systems. There is a Flatpak available, but\nit is not maintained by the Signal project itself. It is possible to \ncompile Signal from source, but it is far easier to create a Debian Distrobox and\ninstall the official Signal package there:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox create -i debian:trixie -n signal -H ~/distrobox/signal\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox enter signal\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first command tells <tt>distrobox</tt> to create a new\ncontainer using the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> image with its home directory set to\n<tt>~/distrobox/signal</tt>, and to name it \"signal\". If the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> container image is not already present on the\nsystem, Distrobox will ask if you want to download it. Note that\nDistrobox uses the system's settings for short-name container\nlookup; it is also possible to pass the full registry path to\n<tt>distrobox</tt> if one prefers. The second command tells it to\nopen a shell inside the container (or <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-enter/\">enter</a> the container) so\none can work within its environment.</p>\n\n<p>All of that will probably look quite\nfamiliar to folks who work with Linux containers regularly, but\nDistrobox is doing quite a bit more behind the scenes. The\n\"<tt>--dry-run</tt>\" (or <span class=\"nobreak\">just \"<tt>-d</tt>\"</span>) option will print out the\ncommand that \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox create</tt></span>\" is\npassing to the container manager for inspection, without taking any\nactions. It's worth eyeballing the output to see what goes into\nsetting up a container that's well-integrated with the host system. In\nthe case of the example command here, there are more than 50 options\npassed to <tt>podman</tt>, including 17 volume mounts. That is a lot\nof container magic that the user is not required to fuss with or know\nabout, unless they want to.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things it does is to set up passwordless <tt>sudo</tt>\ninside the container, so one can immediately install packages in the container and so\nforth. Note that, by default, Distrobox executes the user's login\nshell when entering a container, but <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/useful_tips/#use-a-different-shell-than-the-host\">this\ncan be changed</a> if one wants to use (say) the Fish shell on the\nhost system but GNU Bash inside a Distrobox container.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of setting a home directory is not to provide isolation from the\nuser's home directory, but to avoid clutter. If no home directory is specified,\nthe guest container will <span class=\"nobreak\">use <tt>~/</tt></span>; that may be undesirable if one wants\nto maintain a separate set of configuration files or project directories in a\nDistrobox. Applications and processes in the Distrobox will still be able to\naccess files under the user's normal home directory. For example, if\nDistrobox container is set up with its home as\n<tt>/home/user/distrobox/signal</tt> then that will be set as\n<tt>$HOME</tt> for applications within the container. However, the\napplications can still access files in <tt>/home/user</tt>,\n<tt>/home/user/Documents</tt>, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>The <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-create/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;create</tt></a>\nman page provides a number of useful examples to help getting\nstarted. The \"<tt>distrobox&#160;create&#160;-C</tt>\" command will provide a\ncurrent list of images that are considered compatible with Distrobox. If a\ncontainer image is not listed as compatible, that does not mean it won't work,\njust that it has not been tested and confirmed to work.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, Distroboxes can be destroyed as well as created: \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox rm\n<em>name</em></tt></span>\" will remove a container. That does <em>not</em>,\nhowever, remove the container image from the system. If the goal is to\ncompletely purge the container image as well, then it's necessary to use the\ncontainer manager to do so, e.g. \"<tt>podman&#160;rmi&#160;<em>imagename</em></tt>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Exporting applications and moving containers</h4>\n\n<p>Since Distrobox is often used to run desktop applications, it does not make\nsense to have to enter the Distrobox container each time one wants to run Signal or some\nother application. The project provides a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-export/\">distrobox-export</a> command that sets\nup a <tt>.desktop</tt> file to launch the command directly from one's\ndesktop. For example, this will create a launcher for the Signal desktop client:\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox-export --app signal-desktop\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that the command should be run from within the container\ncreated by Distrobox, not on the host. Assuming that\nthe user is running a desktop environment like GNOME, KDE, or Xfce, an entry for\nSignal should show up in whatever menu or launcher is being used. Now it's not\nnecessary to use \"<tt>distrobox&#160;enter</tt>\" at all to run Signal, it can be\nrun like any other desktop application that is installed on the\nhost. Even though Distrobox prioritizes speed in starting containers,\nthere is usually a small but noticeable lag when launching an application from\na container that hasn't started yet.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, one might want to use a Distrobox container as their\nprimary command-line environment. Some terminal emulators, such as <a\nhref=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis#ptyxis-your-container-oriented-terminal-for-gnome\">Ptyxis</a>,\noffer integration with Distrobox and other container tools; a user can\nset Ptyxis to open new terminal windows in the container\nautomatically. This is particularly handy on image-based systems where\none cannot install software directly on the host using APT or DNF. I\nset Ptyxis to use a Fedora container by default and do my work in the\ncontainer and install additional software therein. To distinguish\nbetween working in the host terminal and in my default container, I\nset the color palette to \"Borland\" from the <a\nhref=\"https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/\">Gogh</a> set of color schemes\nfor terminals. The old-school look is appealing, and I don't get it\nconfused with the black-on-green theme for regular terminals.</p>\n\n<p>The \"<a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-assemble/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt></a>\"\ncommand can automate the creation of one or more Distroboxes. It takes\nan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">INI file</a> with\nspecifications on how to create a new container or multiple\ncontainers. For example, this is a simple <tt>distrobox.ini</tt> that\nwould create a container using a Fedora Rawhide image with several\npackages that I use regularly. The <tt>pull=true</tt> option tells\n<tt>distrobox</tt> to go ahead and pull the container image if it is\nnot available on the system.</p>\n\n<pre>\n    [rawhide]\n    additional_packages=\"emacs emacs-pgtk aerc tmux git lolcat bat\"\n    image=fedora:rawhide\n    pull=true\n    home=/home/jzb/distrobox/rawhide\n</pre>\n\n<p>Jorge Castro has written a <a\nhref=\"https://www.ypsidanger.com/declaring-your-own-personal-distroboxes/\">good\nblog post</a> on using \"<tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt>\" that is\nworth reading for anyone using Distrobox.</p>\n\n<p>The project is not on a time-based schedule, so releases are\nsomewhat sporadic. There is also no roadmap to follow for future\nreleases. Generally, Distrobox seems mostly feature complete, so\nnew versions seem to be mostly about bug fixes or catching up to\nchanges in Linux distributions and container tooling. The most recent\nfeature release was <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.0\">version&#160;1.8.2.0</a>\non October&#160;28 which included Bash completion enhancements, added\nsupport for new guest distributions, and included quite a few\ndocumentation changes as well as bug fixes. With that release,\ndi&#160;Maio also announced the addition of Alessio Biancalana as a\nmaintainer, and Biancalana has headed up the recent minor\nreleases. The most recent is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.2\">1.8.2.2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project does not, unfortunately, have a mailing list or even a web forum:\nthe documentation points users to a <a\nhref=\"https://matrix.to/#/%23distrobox:matrix.org\">Matrix room</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://t.me/distrobox_chat_new\">Telegram group</a> instead. Users\ninterested in making contributions or reporting bugs should check <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\"><tt>CONTRIBUTING.md</tt></a>\nfor guidance.</p>\n\n<p>I've found Distrobox to be enormously useful for providing an easy and quick\nway to run multiple distributions on a single system. Distrobox is probably one\nof my most-used applications after Firefox and Emacs. Multiple versions of Alpine Linux,\nCentOS&#160;Stream, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and others are just a few\nkeystrokes away any time I need them.</p>\n\n</p>",

For example, anyone can deploy and run a Debian-based <a\nhref=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres\">PostgreSQL container</a> \non a Fedora&#160;Linux host. <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/\">Distrobox</a> is a project that is designed to\nbring the cross-distribution compatibility to the desktop and allow users to\nmix-and-match Linux distributions without fussing with dual-booting, virtual\nmachines, or multiple computers. It is an ideal way to install\nadditional software on image-based systems, such as Fedora's <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/\">Atomic Desktops</a>\nor <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1046228/\">Bazzite</a>, and also\nprovides a convenient way to move a development environment or\nfavorite applications to a new system.</p>\n\n<p>Distrobox creator Luca Di Maio <a\nhref=\"https://fedoramagazine.org/run-distrobox-on-fedora-linux/\">was\ninspired</a> by the <a href=\"https://containertoolbx.org/doc/\">Toolbx</a>\nproject (formerly Container Toolbox) for Fedora. Generally, the idea with Linux\ncontainers is to run processes in their own environment to isolate them as much\nas possible from the host without having to resort to virtual machines\nwith their additional overhead. It is possible, though, to set up a container to give it privileged\naccess to the system with little to no isolation. This is typically referred to\nas a <a\nhref=\"https://www.baeldung.com/linux/privileged-container-capabilities#privileged-containers\">privileged\ncontainer</a>.\nIt is possible to set up privileged containers manually, but it requires the\nuser to know a great deal about working with containers and some fairly involved\nsetup. The original goal for Toolbx was to let users run a privileged container\n\"toolbox\" on image-based systems that could be used for system administration\nand troubleshooting without having to include administration utilities in the\nimage itself.</p>\n\n<p>Toolbx has a somewhat limited scope: it works best with specific container images and was primarily developed to provide a software toolbox for\nimage-based Fedora editions like <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/\">CoreOS</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/\">Silverblue</a>. Toolbx is also\nlimited to the <a href=\"https://podman.io/\">Podman</a> container manager, which\nis not ideal for those who prefer to use <a\nhref=\"https://www.docker.com/get-started/\">Docker</a>. Di Maio wanted to have\nbroader compatibility with other Linux distributions as host operating systems\nas well as the ability to use a wide range of container images. He published the\nfirst release, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.0.0\">Distrobox&#160;1.0.0</a>,\nin December&#160;2021, under the GPLv3.</p>\n\n<p>The Distrobox project is, as its homepage notes, \"<q>a fancy\nwrapper</q>\" that works with Docker and Podman, with di Maio's own minimal\ncontainer manager, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/lilipod?tab=readme-ov-file#lilipod\">Lilipod</a>,\nas a fallback if the others are not present. Distrobox is written in POSIX\nshell, so that it is as portable as possible. The <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#aims\">project's\nprimary goal</a> is to allow the use of any Linux distribution containers on any\nLinux distribution host running one of the supported container managers. It also\nhas a goal of entering a container as quickly as possible, \"<q>every millisecond\nadds up if you use the container as your default environment for your\nterminal</q>\".</p>\n\n<p>Di&#160;Maio notes in the project's README that isolation and\nsandboxing of applications are non-goals: \"<q>on the contrary it aims\nto tightly integrate the container with the host</q>\". This means that\ncontainers run by Distrobox have access to the user's home directory, external\nstorage, USB devices, audio devices, and more. The idea of a sandboxed\nmode for Distrobox <a href=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28\">was\ndiscussed</a> but di&#160;Maio ultimately <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28#issuecomment-2408529939\">decided\nagainst</a> implementing one and has <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/pull/1806#issuecomment-3219301182\">opted\nnot to take patches</a> attempting to add isolation features: \"<q>the focus of\ndistrobox is not isolation, security or stuff, but integration and transparency\nwith the host</q>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\n\n<p>Distrobox is packaged for most popular Linux distributions, and the project\nhas a <a href=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#host-distros\">compatibility\ntable of host distributions</a> for those it has been tested on. The table \nhas notes with additional instructions if necessary. There is a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#containers-distros\">table of guest\ndistributions</a> as well that lists the container images that have been successfully\ntested with Distrobox. If a distribution is not mentioned in the host or guest\ntable it does not mean that Distrobox will not work; it simply indicates that\nthe combinations have not been tested. Users will also need one of the supported\ncontainer managers installed as well.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of how and why one might use Distrobox: the <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/#signal\">Signal</a> project only provides <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/download/linux/\">packages for Debian-based\ndistributions</a>, so there are no official packages for Arch, Fedora, openSUSE,\nor other non-Debian systems. There is a Flatpak available, but\nit is not maintained by the Signal project itself. It is possible to \ncompile Signal from source, but it is far easier to create a Debian Distrobox and\ninstall the official Signal package there:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox create -i debian:trixie -n signal -H ~/distrobox/signal\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox enter signal\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first command tells <tt>distrobox</tt> to create a new\ncontainer using the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> image with its home directory set to\n<tt>~/distrobox/signal</tt>, and to name it \"signal\". If the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> container image is not already present on the\nsystem, Distrobox will ask if you want to download it. Note that\nDistrobox uses the system's settings for short-name container\nlookup; it is also possible to pass the full registry path to\n<tt>distrobox</tt> if one prefers. The second command tells it to\nopen a shell inside the container (or <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-enter/\">enter</a> the container) so\none can work within its environment.</p>\n\n<p>All of that will probably look quite\nfamiliar to folks who work with Linux containers regularly, but\nDistrobox is doing quite a bit more behind the scenes. The\n\"<tt>--dry-run</tt>\" (or <span class=\"nobreak\">just \"<tt>-d</tt>\"</span>) option will print out the\ncommand that \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox create</tt></span>\" is\npassing to the container manager for inspection, without taking any\nactions. It's worth eyeballing the output to see what goes into\nsetting up a container that's well-integrated with the host system. In\nthe case of the example command here, there are more than 50 options\npassed to <tt>podman</tt>, including 17 volume mounts. That is a lot\nof container magic that the user is not required to fuss with or know\nabout, unless they want to.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things it does is to set up passwordless <tt>sudo</tt>\ninside the container, so one can immediately install packages in the container and so\nforth. Note that, by default, Distrobox executes the user's login\nshell when entering a container, but <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/useful_tips/#use-a-different-shell-than-the-host\">this\ncan be changed</a> if one wants to use (say) the Fish shell on the\nhost system but GNU Bash inside a Distrobox container.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of setting a home directory is not to provide isolation from the\nuser's home directory, but to avoid clutter.

For example, if\nDistrobox container is set up with its home as\n<tt>/home/user/distrobox/signal</tt> then that will be set as\n<tt>$HOME</tt> for applications within the container.

        "u/markatlarge: I'm glad this story got out there, and I really want to thank Emanuel Maiberg for reporting it. I'm an independent developer with no clout, and I lost access to my Google account for several months. Nothing changed until Emanuel reached out to Google.\n\nThe real story here is how broken the system is. In my appeal, I told Google exactly where the dataset came from. I even contacted people in Google's Trust &amp; Safety and developer teams. No one responded. The dataset remained online for more than two months until I reported it to C3P, which finally led to it being taken down.\n\nHere's what really gets me: that dataset had been publicly available for 6 years and contained known CSAM images. So what's the point of these laws that give big tech massive powers to scan all our data if they let this stuff sit out there for 6 years? They banned me in hours for accidentally finding it, but the actual problem went unaddressed until I reported it myself.  \n\nIf your interested in the subject I encourage you to read some of my medium posts.",

There's no way a cie serving the whole world have humans taking care of everything so not only bad mistakes will be everywhere all the time but it will take a very long time to fix them case by case.\n\n This is so much shit. The digital world is both the best and worst thing that could happen to society. I wonder if there ever was something else in time that was viewed the same.",
        "u/Hrmbee: Concerning details:\n\n&gt;The incident shows how AI training data, which is collected by indiscriminately scraping the internet, can impact people who use it without realizing it contains illegal images. The incident also shows how hard it is to identify harmful images in training data composed of millions of images, which in this case were only discovered accidentally by a lone developer who tripped Google\u2019s automated moderation tools. \n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;In October, Lloyd Richardson, C3P's director of technology, told me that the organization decided to investigate the NudeNet training data after getting a tip from an individual via its cyber tipline that it might contain CSAM. After I published that story, a developer named Mark Russo contacted me to say that he\u2019s the individual who tipped C3P, but that he\u2019s still suffering the consequences of his discovery.\n&gt;\n&gt;Russo, an independent developer, told me he was working on an on-device NSFW image detector. The app runs locally and can detect images locally so the content stays private. To benchmark his tool, Russo used NudeNet, a publicly available dataset that\u2019s cited in a number of academic papers about content moderation. Russo unzipped the dataset into his Google Drive. Shortly after, his Google account was suspended for \u201cinappropriate material.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;On July 31, Russo lost access to all the services associated with his Google account, including his Gmail of 14 years, Firebase, the platform that serves as the backend for his apps, AdMob, the mobile app monetization platform, and Google Cloud. \n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cThis wasn\u2019t just disruptive \u2014 it was devastating. I rely on these tools to develop, monitor, and maintain my apps,\u201d Russo wrote on his personal blog. \u201cWith no access, I\u2019m flying blind.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;Russo filed an appeal of Google\u2019s decision the same day, explaining that the images came from NudeNet, which he believed was a reputable research dataset with only adult content. Google acknowledged the appeal, but upheld its suspension, and rejected a second appeal as well. He is still locked out of his Google account and the Google services associated with it. \n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;After I reached out for comment, Google investigated Russo\u2019s account again and reinstated it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cGoogle is committed to fighting the spread of CSAM and we have robust protections against the dissemination of this type of content,\u201d a Google spokesperson told me in an email. \u201cIn this case, while CSAM was detected in the user account, the review should have determined that the user's upload was non-malicious. The account in question has been reinstated, and we are committed to continuously improving our processes.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cI understand I\u2019m just an independent developer\u2014the kind of person Google doesn\u2019t care about,\u201d Russo told me. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly why this story matters. It\u2019s not just about me losing access; it\u2019s about how the same systems that claim to fight abuse are silencing legitimate research and innovation through opaque automation [...]I tried to do the right thing \u2014 and I was punished.\u201d\n\nOne of the major points of concern here is (yet again) big tech on one hand promising convenience in exchange for using their suites of services, and on the other hand acting arbitrarily and sometimes capriciously when it comes to locking people out of their accounts. That it takes inquiries from journalists for people to have their accounts reinstated is deeply troubling, and speaks to a lack of responsiveness by these companies.

      "full_content": "The HDMI Forum, responsible for the HDMI specification, continues to stonewall open source. Valve's Steam Machine theoretically supports HDMI 2.1, but the mini-PC is software-limited to HDMI 2.0. As a result, more than 60 frames per second at 4K resolution are only possible with limitations.\n\nContinue after ad\n\nIn a statement to Ars Technica, a Valve spokesperson confirmed that HDMI 2.1 support is \"still a work-in-progress on the software side.\" \"We\u2019ve been working on trying to unblock things there.\"\n\nThe Steam Machine uses an AMD Ryzen APU with a Radeon graphics unit. Valve strictly adheres to open-source drivers, but the HDMI Forum is unwilling to disclose the 2.1 specification. According to Valve, they have validated the HDMI 2.1 hardware under Windows to ensure basic functionality.\n\nNo Change After Almost Two Years\n\nThe restriction imposed by the HDMI Forum was already criticized in early 2024 by an AMD employee responsible for Linux. Even then, according to AMD, they had submitted a functional, HDMI 2.1-compatible driver, which the HDMI Forum rejected.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the HDMI Forum rejected our proposal,\" it was stated at the time. \"At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements.\"\n\nOnly HDMI 2.1 offers sufficient bandwidth for 120 or 144 Hertz at 3840 \u00d7 2160 pixels without compression. Furthermore, this version introduced manufacturer-independent variable refresh rates (HDMI VRR). Valve enables 4K and 120 Hertz using chroma subsampling, a compression technique that is particularly noticeable with text. VRR functions in the form of AMD's Freesync, which requires compatible displays.\n\nContinue after ad\n\nAlternatively, interested parties can use an active adapter from DisplayPort 1.4 to HDMI 2.1 to increase the frame rate without compression. However, they do not officially support VRR. Popular variants from Club3D are no longer available; offers from less well-known providers (starting from 35,67 \u20ac) are still available in price comparisons.\n\n(mma)",

HDMI 2.0 does 4K @ 60hz, and Valve have 4K @ 120hz (with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling) working over it too. Given the CPU/GPU in this machine, it won't be able to push higher than those limits anyway.",

Someone from MI6 tells Bond that \"no one was ever able to catch him\". The person continues that they only know \"he will arrive in England on flight XYZ\", but they can't catch him because they don't know who it is.\n\nAre they telling me that MI6 and/or the police cannot stop a passenger plane on the ground and then thoroughly screen each passenger to find this terrorist?",

He could have shown them a receipt, or gotten the shop to verify that he was there. Instead he instantly makes himself look more guilty by fleeing the scene of the crime and running from the cops. \n\nTo make me more infuriated, at the end of the film, the cop (played by Forest Whitaker) says he knew he was innocent the whole time. Why? \u201cBecause the bagels were still warm\u201d. \n\nSo not only did he have an alibi, but the cops knew he was innocent the entire film. What a goddamn waste of an hour and 40 minutes that movie was, and an insult to the audience.",

According to the movie all the Kaiju that *ever* appeared were heading towards Mount Fuji. This makes no sense because the Kaiju all originated from a single point in the Pacific Ocean, but went to different countries &amp; continents. If they were all heading to mount Fuji then they would have only ever attacked Japan. It's one of the dumbest plot points of any movie I've ever seen.",

Then, instead of landing on what you would expect to be the middle of the road, he's somehow teleported into what looks like a QUARRY, lying on a conveyer belt that deposits him into a ~~hydraulic press~~ piledriver!

The film stars American actor Jim Caviezel as Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nCaviezel is widely known for his starring in Sound of Freedom and for portraying Jesus Christ in Mel Gibson\u2019s The Passion of the Christ.\n\nThe production, filmed in Brazil and the United States, is directed by filmmaker Cyrus Nowrasteh and is expected to come out in 2026. The first teaser trailer, released this week, showcases some key moments of Bolsonaro\u2019s career, such as his tenure as a Brazilian lawmaker, his marriage to former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro the 2018 failed assassination attempt against him during that year\u2019s presidential campaign, and his recovery.\n\nThe trailer features a cinematic cover of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Survivor, which the singer\u2019s team reportedly claims was used without due authorization.\n\nAnderson Nick, a Brazilian man identified by CNN Brasil as the person in charge of the Brazilian branch of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s charitable foundation BeyGOOD, announced through Instagram that \u201clegal measures\u201d were already being carried to have the trailer taken down as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThank you to everyone who sent me DMs saying that the song \u2018Survivor\u2019 was used in the trailer for the movie about the unmentionable, ineligible, coup-plotting convict,\u201d Nick reportedly wrote on an Instagram story.\n\n\u201cObviously, the song was used without permission, and legal measures are already being taken to have it removed from the air as soon as possible. Thank you,\u201d he concluded.\n\nJail Bolsonaro served as President of Brazil between 2019 and 2022, narrowly losing against current radical socialist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in that year\u2019s election.\n\nThe 70 year-old former President is presently serving a 27 years and 3 months prison sentence on dubious \u201ccharges of \u201ccrimes against democracy.\u201d Bolsonaro was also imposed a 35 year ban from running for office \u2014 as a result, he will only be allowed to run again at the age of 105.\n\nBrazil\u2019s top court, the Supreme Tribunal Federal (STF) has repeatedly rejected granting humanitarian house arrest benefits to Bolsonaro, who in addition to being recently diagnosed with skin cancer, suffers from multiple health conditions, of which the most severe are a direct consequence of the severe internal organ damage caused by the 2018 failed assassination attempt.",

The designer and model often opts for a 90s-inspired brown lip liner, paired with a gloss or stain for a sultry, on-trend look that\u2019s easy to wear.\n\nSo, it was fairly unsurprising when she began by lining her pout with the cult-favorite Makeup For Ever Artist Color Pencil, also a go-to for Hailey Bieber, Jennifer Lopez, Sabrina Carpenter, Suni Lee and many other stars.\n\nThe pinky-brown, soft contrast lip is a staple both on the red carpet and off. (Though the creamy, long-wear pencil can also be used on eyes or brows, making it a versatile makeup bag hero.)\n\nMakeup For Ever\n\nThe brand confirmed that Richie Grainge is using Anywhere Caffeine, a warm, caramel nude shade also adored by Bieber.\n\nThe multi-purpose pencil also comes in several gorgeous nudes and browns, from Lee\u2019s favorite Whatever Walnut to Endless Cacao. (We even found a giftable kit with five mini favorites.)\n\nRichie Grainge uses hers to fill in the outer parts of her lips, before applying Summer Fridays Dream Lip Oil in one of the soft pink mauve shades.\n\nSummer Fridays\n\nSummer Fridays is a staple line for the star, who has posted several times using the brand\u2019s Lip Butter Balm (practically every editor also has it in their bag).\n\nRichie Grainge\u2019s recent TikTok shared a nude lip combo we love. TikTok/SofiaRichie\n\nThe vitamin E-packed Dream Lip Oil offers the same lip-loving moisture, with nine plant-based oils, but has more shine and tint. (This combo is so pretty for everyday, but also a match with a smoky eye.)\n\nShoppers give the lip oil rave reviews, with one on Amazon sharing, \u201cThe bottle is so pretty, and the color is fresh and vibrant. The lip oil leaves your lips hydrated with a beautiful tint.

Roxanna Valenzuela/Instagram\n\nAnd amid it all, the former mayor tells us\u2026 he\u2019s in love!\n\nIt recently came to light that the lefty pol began an affair with South Tucson mayor Roxanna Valenzuela while he was still seeing now ex, political strategist Nomiki Konst, who he\u2019d been dating for nearly a year.\n\nBut now a source tells us that de Blasio and Valenzuela first met for a business lunch in September \u2014 more than a month before he split from Konst \u2014 and the pair went back to his apartment to have sex.\n\n8 They met up two days later to volunteer at a soup kitchen. Roxanna Valenzuela/Instagram\n\n8 De Blasio was dating political strategist Nomiki Kost at the time. Stefan Jeremiah\n\nJust two days later Valenzuela took him to volunteer at a soup kitchen and once again, tins of split pea soup weren\u2019t the only cans Hizzoner got his hands on, says a source.\n\nMeanwhile, the former mayor was still seeing progressive activist and former \u201cYoung Turks\u201d correspondent Konst.\n\nA source tells us de Blasio \u2014 who ran the city from 2014 to 2021 \u2014 came clean to her about the steamy dalliance while they were on a vacation in Greece just days after the saucy soup kitchen tryst when she was in the midst of a round of IVF for egg freezing. (She and de Blasio weren\u2019t planning to have kids, we\u2019re told).\n\nA source close to Konst tells us the pair attempted to get their relationship back on track.\n\n8 The pair had been together for ten months. Instagram/@nomikikonst\n\n8 We hear the former mayor fessed up to the affair while they were on vacation in Greece. Instagram/@nomikikonst\n\nBut on November 4, we\u2019re told that Konst \u201clearned he was still talking to Roxanna and [Roxanna] was coming to NYC [to see him] while they were walking into Zohran Mamdani\u2019s election night victory party.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re told press cameras were snapping away as Konst processed the devastating news.\n\nNow de Blasio tells Page Six that he \u201cfell in love\u201d with Valenzuela.\n\n\u201cI wish Nomiki well and I\u2019m sorry for how our relationship ended,\u201d he told us. \u201cI fell in love with someone else and I should have told her sooner. I\u2019m now in a wonderful relationship with Roxanna Valenzuela that we will continue to nurture and keep private.\u201d\n\n8 The final straw came during Zohran Mamdani\u2019s election night party. Instagram/@nomikikonst\n\nWhen asked if he wanted to comment on the more sordid details of their initial meeting, de Blasio told us, \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\n\nThere was no response to request for comment from Valenzuela or Konst.\n\nDe Blasio, 64, and Valenzuela, 41, were snapped posing together over the weekend in Arizona at a swearing-in ceremony for newly elected Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva.\n\nBut we hear Konst, 41, has also moved on.\n\nA spy tells us they spotted the political commentator at the Hellenic Initiative Gala at Cipriani Wall Street this weekend, posing for pics with a hunky Staten Island firefighter named Keith Tavella.\n\n8 De Blasio was spotted with Valenzuela in Arizona this weekend and tells us he is \u201cin love.\u201d Roxanna Valenzuela/Instagram\n\n\u201cIt seems like an upgrade,\u201d said a source of the new man, who they noted seemed much younger than de Blasio.\n\nDe Blasio has two children with Chirlane McCray, who formerly identified as a lesbian. The pair separated in 2023 and do not intend to divorce.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s messy love life has made headlines since he and McCray split.\n\n8 Konst appears to have moved on with fireman Keith Tavella. Instagram/nomikikonst\n\nHe was spotted making out at Empire Rooftop Bar with a mystery woman for three hours in September 2023, and was seen a few months later taking a married woman, Kristy Stark, on a romantic stroll through Manhattan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about my wife holding hands with Bill de Blasio,\u201d that married woman\u2019s befuddled husband, Owen Stark, told The Post at the time.\n\nStark later said she and her husband were \u201cin the process of getting a divorce,\u201d which also came as a surprise to her husband.",
