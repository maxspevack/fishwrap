December 10, 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to increase System Open Market Account (SOMA) securities holdings to maintain an ample level of reserves through purchases in the secondary market of Treasury bills (or, if needed, of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>These reserve management purchases (RMPs) will be sized to accommodate projected trend growth in the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities as well as seasonal fluctuations, such as those driven by tax payment dates.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Monthly amounts of RMPs will be announced on or around the ninth business day of each month alongside a tentative schedule of purchase operations for the subsequent approximately thirty days. </strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><u><strong>The Desk plans to release the first schedule on December 11, 2025, with a total amount of RMPs of approximately $40 billion in Treasury bills; purchases will start on December 12, 2025. </strong></u></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><u><strong>The Desk anticipates that the pace of RMPs will remain elevated for a few months to offset expected large increases in non-reserve liabilities in April. </strong></u><em><strong>[ZH: and in May Powell is out and Trump replaces him with a dovish surrogate].</strong></em></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After that, the pace of total purchases will likely be significantly reduced in line with expected seasonal patterns in Federal Reserve liabilities. Purchase amounts will be adjusted as appropriate based on the outlook for reserve supply and market conditions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Desk was also directed in October to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency securities into Treasury bills via secondary market purchases. <strong>The monthly schedule of planned purchases will include RMPs as well as these purchases.</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Desk plans to distribute the monthly secondary market purchases across two Treasury bill sectors. Purchase amounts in each sector will be determined by sector weights. These sector weights will be based on the 12-month average of the par amount of Treasury bills outstanding in each sector relative to the total amount outstanding across the two sectors as initially measured at the end of September 2025.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><p>For the purists this is \"Reserve Management Purchases\", for the non-purists, QE is back with us.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>SEP PROJECTIONS:</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><strong>Fed Funds</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 3.625% (exp. 3.625%, prev. 3.625%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 3.375% (exp. 3.375%, prev. 3.375%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 3.125% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.125%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 3.125% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.125%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 3.00% (exp. 3.125%, prev. 3.00%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>GDP Growth</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025:1.7% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.3% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.0% (exp. 1.9%, prev. 1.9%)</li>\n\t<li>2028:1.9% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 1.8% (exp. 1.8%, prev. 1.8%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Unemployment rate</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 4.5% (exp. 4.5%, prev. 4.5%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 4.4% (exp. 4.5%, prev. 4.4%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 4.2% (exp. 4.4%, prev. 4.3%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 4.2% (exp. 4.2%, prev. 4.2%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 4.2% (exp. 4.2%, prev. 4.2%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>PCE Inflation</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 2.9% (exp. 2.9%, prev. 3.0%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.4% (exp. 2.6%, prev. 2.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.1% (exp. 2.1%, prev. 2.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 2.0% (exp. 2.0%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n\t<li>Longer run: 2.0% (exp. 2.0%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Core PCE Inflation</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>2025: 3.0% (exp. 3.0%, prev. 3.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2026: 2.5% (exp. 2.6%, prev. 2.6%)</li>\n\t<li>2027: 2.1% (exp. 2.2%, prev. 2.1%)</li>\n\t<li>2028: 2.0% (exp. 2.1%, prev. 2.0%)</li>\n</ul><p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"640406f7-0815-4153-b29d-a359b0177fb7\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"199\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/get_attachment_url%20%2813%29_5.jpg?itok=SV3CAqOo\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Finally, in a difference from the state of play into December 2024's hawkish cut, we note that equity positioning into the Fed looked skewed toward expectations for a benign or mildly hawkish cut that<strong> leaves the high-beta rotation intact,</strong> with the<strong> SPX still contained in a wider trading range</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Implied, realized and vol-of-vol are all back at more normal levels after November\u2019s turbulence, while correlations and the tail-risk indexes sit in the middle or lower end of recent bands.

It wasn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To understand the true purpose that Obamacare served, you have to first go back and understand why government first intervened in the healthcare market a little over a century ago.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It was not, as the progressive creation myths many of us are taught in school suggest, to protect Americans from maniacal doctors or food and drug companies that were trying to kill them. Nor was it to help Americans afford healthcare\u2014prices back then weren\u2019t anywhere near the absurd levels we see today.</p>\n\n<p>The reason government began intervening in healthcare was because some industry insiders and interest groups recognized that they could achieve and protect a level of market dominance practically unseen up to that point if they stopped merely trying to offer customers more value than their competitors and instead used government power to warp the healthcare industry to their benefit.</p>\n\n<p>That began when a physicians\u2019 interest group\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLtB4Jl1dR0&list=PLALopHfWkFlF8FiKMUYeC_u31CvCxYC4X&index=20&t=2195s\">maneuvered</a>\u00a0its way into setting the accreditation standards for American medical schools. That position of influence allowed the group to ban programs that didn\u2019t align with its specific medical philosophy, leading to the forced closure of nearly half the country\u2019s medical schools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This created an artificial shortage of doctors, which kicked off the affordability crisis that has defined American healthcare ever since.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Of course, the problem was still quite limited in the early days. But as other related industries\u2014especially\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-trump-can-lower-drug-prices-without-price-controls\">pharmaceuticals</a>\u2014began falling prey to the same crony dynamic at the heart of the Progressive Era, healthcare quickly began to grow more expensive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, the health insurance industry followed the lead of healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies and lobbied government officials for rules and regulations that benefited insurance companies\u2019 bottom lines.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That effort culminated in a reworking of the tax code under President Truman. The government made employer-provided health insurance tax-deductible while it continued to tax other forms of employee compensation and other means of paying for care. In other words, the government used the tax code to change how Americans paid for healthcare. It didn\u2019t take long for employer-provided insurance plans to become the dominant arrangement and for health insurance to morph away from actual insurance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shortly after that happened, the government significantly ramped up demand for the artificially-constrained supply of medical care with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, leading to an easily-predictable\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive?d7_alias_migrate=1\">explosion</a>\u00a0in the price of healthcare.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And, as fewer and fewer people could afford healthcare at these higher prices, more government assistance was required, which meant more demand, higher prices, more need for government support, and so on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This was not good for everyday Americans, </strong>but it was excellent for healthcare providers and drug companies whose revenues were ballooning as more and more cash poured into the healthcare system.</p>\n\n<p>And it was great for the health \u201cinsurance\u201d companies. All the taxes on competing means of payment effectively acted as a subsidy, putting the industry in a strong position to benefit from the mounting crisis because, in addition to facilitating most of the country\u2019s healthcare spending, they helped these providers grow far beyond the typical bounds of insurance.</p>\n\n<p>In a free market, insurance serves as a means to trade risk. It works well for accidents and calamities that are hard to predict individually but relatively easy to predict in bulk, like car accidents, house fires, and unexpected family deaths. But with the government incentivizing people to buy healthcare through insurance plans, those plans began to grow to cover easily-predictable occurrences like annual physicals.</p>\n\n<p>So, zooming out, industry leaders and interest groups joined forces with government officials to use government interventions to create a healthcare system designed to move as much money as possible to healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and the insurance industry. That is, and has always been, the main motivation behind the federal government\u2019s healthcare policy.</p>\n\n<p>But, as with any scheme like this, the party cannot last forever. It only works as long as money keeps coming in. For an important service like healthcare, which most people don\u2019t consider optional, the threshold is pretty high. But there is still a point where premiums grow too high, fewer employers or individual buyers are willing to buy insurance, and the flow of money into the healthcare system starts to falter.</p>\n\n<p>According to the government\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/health-insurance/historical-series/hib.html\">own census data</a>, that tipping point was reached in the early 2000s. <strong>For the first time since the scam had really kicked off, the number of people with health insurance began to fall each year. The industry\u2014which had apparently assumed the flow of money would never stop increasing\u2014began to panic. </strong></p>\n\n<p>Something had to be done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And that something was Obamacare.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Despite all the talk of affordability and access used to sell the bill to the public, the Affordable Care Act is best understood\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Overcharged-Americans-Much-Health-Care/dp/1944424768\">as a ploy</a>\u00a0by the healthcare industry and the government to keep the party going.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Obamacare\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ148/PLAW-111publ148.pdf\">required</a>\u00a0all 50 million uninsured Americans to obtain insurance and greatly expanded what these \u201cinsurance\u201d companies covered. Demand for healthcare shot back up, and the vicious cycle\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/The-Economics-of-ObamaCare/Jasinski/p/book/9781032472317\">started back up again</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As any competent economist was saying\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-daily/socialized-healthcare-vs-laws-economics\">before the bill was even passed</a>, ramping demand back up would not make healthcare more \u201caffordable,\u201d it would only raise prices. And that\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive?d7_alias_migrate=1\">exactly what happened</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, as prices rose higher and health \u201cinsurance\u201d moved further and further away from actual insurance, it\u2019s made the American people even more dependent on the government for healthcare, which is how we\u2019ve arrived at our current situation where extra, \u201ctemporary\u201d subsidies rolled out during an official national emergency need to be made permanent to keep everything going.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you want to take the political establishment at their word, the best you can say is that Obamacare kicked the can down the road and made the healthcare affordability crisis worse in exchange for a bit of temporary relief for some uninsured Americans.</p>\n\n<p>But if you view the ACA within the context of the last century of American healthcare policy, <strong>it reversed the faltering demand for healthcare and health insurance, accelerated the racket</strong> moving as much money as possible into the industry, and quickly became a new political third rail that the \u201copposition\u201d party refuses to even consider rolling back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s hard to view that as anything other than a meaningful success.</strong></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T18:05:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 13:05</span>\n",

Somehow, the sentence I'm about to write is even more dispiriting than the one that precedes it: Kyrgios and Sabalenka spent a half an hour on Tuesday promoting this match on Piers Morgan's show.\n\nThe newsworthy portion of the conversation arrived about halfway through, when Morgan turned to the topic of trans participation in sports. \"Martina Navratilova, a former No. 1 like yourself, says it's wrong for the Women's Tennis Association to allow trans women to compete in its events, do you agree with that?\" Morgan asked. Sabalenka replied:\n\nThat's a tricky question. I have nothing to do against [trans people], but I feel like they still got a huge advantage over the woman, and I think it's just not fair to the woman to basically face biologically a man. It's not fair, the woman been working her whole life to reach her limit, and then she has to face a man, which is biologically much stronger, so for me I don't agree with this kind of stuff in sport.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Kyrgios said that Sabalenka had \"hit the nail on the head.\"\n\nThis is all standard fare that you've heard from anti-trans activists hundreds of times by now, but this particular conversation was made more interesting by where it went next. Immediately after agreeing with Kyrgios and Sabalenka, Morgan brought up an incident from earlier this year when Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostyuk implied that Sabalenka has an advantage over her because of her size and potentially \"higher level of testosterone.\"\n\nHere was an interesting moment. Morgan, totally on accident (he asked this question in order to tee up a punchline built around putting Sabalenka's bikini pictures on screen), had plowed the conversation into a queasy and inconvenient truth that anti-trans agitators refuse to grapple with: In the absence of any actual high-level trans athletes attempting to compete, those who most prominently suffer when trans bans are put into place are cis athletes who do not conform to a particular image of femininity. In other words, if anyone currently on the tour is going to end up being subjected to gross speculation and invasive sex testing under a trans ban, it's players who look like Sabalenka.\n\nNone of this, nor the fact that they had just finished talking about how physical advantages can undermine the competitive fairness of their sport, seemed to enter into Sabalaneka's or Kyrgios's heads as they gave their response about Kostyuk:\n\nSabalenka: All I hear here is just excuses. And it's actually quite funny because she's a strong a girl, she probably has more muscles than I do. She looks fit and strong, and I think that's not the case in all of the matches she lost against top players. Kyrgios: We kind of debunked that. Someone like John Isner or Ivo Karlovi\u0107 was a fair bit bigger than Roger Federer, but that doesn't really\u2014 Morgan: Yeah, you're always going to get physical differences between players, obviously\u2014 Sabalenka: I think that's not the key in sports.\n\nThe most important ingredient in maintaining a commitment to anti-trans bigotry is never stopping to think about anything for more than two seconds.",

I\u2019m not a \u2018wake up and go back to bed\u2019 type just yet, unless it\u2019s cold and rainy. If I miss too many gym days, I really can feel it \u2014 a stiffness creeping in here and there. If I let that set in, well, God help me.\"</p><p>\"At the gym,\u00a0I usually do a circuit, going from one machine to the next without a break, in a circle,\" he said. \"I start with the sit-up machine. [My wife] Arlene says I could do 500, but that might be exaggerating. Then I do all the leg machines religiously because my legs are two of my most cherished possessions. And then the upper body.\"</p><p>\"The secret ingredient is the music,\" he continued. \"Most of my humming and singing really happens when I\u2019m going from one machine to another.

Arlene is half my age, and she makes me feel somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters my age \u2014 which is still saying a lot. Every day she finds a new way to keep me up and moving, bright and hopeful and needed.\"</p><p>\"Boiled down, the things that have kept my life joyful and fulfilling are pretty simple: romance, doing what I love and a whole lot of laughing,\" he continued.</p><p>\"Let me show you what that looks like on the ground, as they say. To pull the \u2018grumpy old man\u2019 away from the TV, Arlene will dance along to the pharmaceutical ads.

And if it\u2019s a good day, which it almost always is in our house, we\u2019ll break into a little swaying and soft-shoe right there.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, the beloved entertainer\u2019s biggest piece of advice for embracing aging is surprisingly simple: don\u2019t be afraid to laugh at yourself. A sense of humor, he says, can outshine the hardest parts of growing older.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/then-and-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"As I get older,</a> I have found that life is more and more a comedy of errors,\" he said. \"So if you can\u2019t laugh at yourself, you\u2019ve got big problems.\"</p>",

Julia Coleman, who represents Carver County in southwest Minneapolis, told Fox News Digital.\u00a0</p><p>\"Governor Tim Walz is in charge of making sure that the taxpayers' dollars are protected.\"</p><p>Minneapolis has been at the center of controversy in recent weeks over a massive fraud scheme dating back to at least 2020 that permeated several departments and several nonprofits ranging from childcare services, to COVID-19 relief, to autism care, and is believed by many to eventually eclipse $1 billion in wasted state and federal taxpayer funds.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/schemes-stacked-upon-schemes-1b-human-services-fraud-fuels-scrutiny-of-minnesotas-somali-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>\u2018SCHEMES STACKED UPON SCHEMES\u2019: $1B PUBLIC BENEFITS FRAUD FUELS SCRUTINY OF MINNESOTA\u2019S SOMALI COMMUNITY</strong></a></p><p>\"He had years to stop this,\" Coleman said about Walz, who has\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-derelict-leadership-to-blame-in-1b-fraud-scandal-with-haunting-reminds-of-watergate-gop-challenger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>faced increasing backlash</u></a> for not taking swift action to investigate the fraud.\u00a0He said the governor \"only seems to care now that it\u2019s getting national attention.\"</p><p>State Rep. Mark Koran, who represents Minnesota\u2019s District 28 in eastern Minnesota, told Fox News Digital the \"scale and scope\" of the fraud is \"almost incomprehensible\" and that the buck stops with Walz.\u00a0</p><p><strong>\"</strong>You have to look at who's been solely in charge of that process, which has been Governor Walz,\" Koran said. \"The executive body controls every agency.

And I think they're actually both.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/expert-reveals-key-factor-led-massive-minnesota-fraud-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>EXPERT REVEALS KEY FACTOR THAT LED TO MASSIVE MINNESOTA FRAUD SCHEME</strong></a></p><p>In addition to facing overall blame due to the governor overseeing all the agencies involved in the fraud, Walz has faced criticism for his specific response to the Feeding Our Future scandal, which involves a\u00a0scheme that prosecutors say exploited a federally funded children\u2019s nutrition program administered by the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, siphoning money meant to provide meals to low-income kids.\u00a0</p><p>It now stands as the nation's largest COVID-19 fraud case.</p><p><strong>\"</strong>Minnesota has an epidemic of fraud, as the rest of the nation is learning,\" GOP state Sen. Michael Kreun told Fox News Digital. \"We've known here in Minnesota for quite some time that we've had a massive fraud problem, and it's turning out that probably Minnesota is the epicenter of fraud in the United States right now, which is really unfortunate. And you know, we've been working on a lot of anti-fraud measures, particularly over the last year. Unfortunately, Governor Walz has been fighting us in those efforts.\"</p><p>Kreun, who represents the 32nd District in Anoka County north of Minneapolis, said that while there are many culprits, Walz \"first and foremost has allowed this fraud to happen.\"</p><p><strong>\"</strong>Attorney General Keith Ellison has also been very negligent in his handling of the fraud,\" Kreun explained. \"Seems like most of our social services programs here in Minnesota were basically set up under kind of the honor system, and there have not been a lot of guardrails. And once the fraudsters realized how to exploit these programs, the administration, the Walz administration, hasn't done really anything to put safeguards in place to prevent the fraud that was developing over a number of years.\"</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Republican</a> legislators plan to take action during the next legislative session to implement more oversight of the troubled agencies, Koran told Fox News Digital that many don\u2019t understand the \"challenge\" they face is that the legislature \"doesn\u2019t have any oversight in the execution and operations of these agencies.\"</p><p><strong>\"</strong>The governor has had sole responsibility since the day he's arrived,\" Koran said. \"He entered into a fraudulent environment. He's enhanced the fraudulent environment, and he's not done a single thing to stop that fraud.\"</p><p>A spokesperson from Walz's office pushed back on the lawmakers, saying in a statement to Fox News Digital that Walz \"views addressing fraud as a top priority.\"</p><p>\"Over the last three years, he has made systematic changes to state government,\" the spokesperson said. \"Detecting fraud is resource intensive and time-consuming \u2014 especially when it comes to the federal Medicaid programs that have a complex interplay between federal, state, and county governments and private insurance companies. It is an issue that many states, both red and blue, have faced.\"</p><p>\"That is why we have created additional checks and balances throughout state government. We have hired investigators, auditors, and law enforcement. The Governor has brought in an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs at the Department of Human Services (DHS) and created a specialized fraud-fighting law enforcement unit at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He has installed new leadership at DHS with a single-minded focus on stopping fraudulent payments. Many of the changes have not been flashy or headline-grabbing, but rather just the hard work of building stronger safeguards throughout state government.\"</p><p><i>Fox News Digital's Amada Macias contributed to this report.</i></p>",

Our public education system in Minnesota and across the country must be a bastion of merit and equal opportunity \u2014 not DEI,\" Attorney General <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pam-bondi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pam Bondi</a> said in a DOJ statement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/ex-wisconsin-university-dei-staffer-wins-265k-settlement-after-alleging-discrimination-being-white\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>EX-WISCONSIN UNIVERSITY DEI STAFFER WINS $265K SETTLEMENT AFTER ALLEGING DISCRIMINATION FOR BEING WHITE</strong></a></p><p>The collective bargaining agreement also includes the defendants' relationship with a third-party group known as \"Black Men Teach.\" Fellows of \"Black Men Teach\" were allotted extra paid training days and were exempt from \"normal layoff policies, according to the DOJ. The department pointed out that, as the name implies, only black men are allowed to become \"Black Men Teach\" fellows.</p><p>\"While Defendants claim that these provisions are to stop discrimination, they require Defendants to blatantly discriminate against teachers based on their race, color, sex and national origin,\" the DOJ complaint reads.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-appointed-judge-strikes-down-anti-dei-measures-from-education-department\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGE STRIKES DOWN ANTI-DEI MEASURES FROM EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</strong></a></p><p>The department also claims that MPS documents show the district is aiming to increase the number of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) staff by 40%. Additionally, the DOJ says the documents show that MPS is working to ensure that by 2026\u20132027 that at least 54.3% of new teacher hires are BIPOC.</p><p>\"Employers may not provide more favorable terms and conditions of employment based on an employee\u2019s race and sex,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division said <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-minneapolis-public-schools-racial-discrimination-against-teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">in a statement</a>. \"The Department of Justice will vigorously pursue employers who deny their employees equal opportunities and benefits by classifying and limiting them based on their race, color, national origin or sex.\"</p><p>In the complaint, the DOJ urges the court to declare the policies to be discriminatory and in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and to prevent the district from implementing similar provisions in a future collective bargaining agreement.</p><p>MPS did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p>",

Researchers used the cultured cells to print about 300 transparent implants with Precise Bio's regenerative platform.\u00a0</p><p>Their system builds a layered structure that looks and behaves like a natural cornea. It is designed to provide clarity, strength and long-term function.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-tiny-retinal-implant-helping-people-regain-sight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>HOW A TINY RETINAL IMPLANT IS HELPING PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR SIGHT</strong></a></p><p>Since donor shortages prevent millions from receiving sight-saving care each year, this approach could transform access. Many patients in developed countries wait only a few days for a transplant, while others wait years due to low tissue availability. A single donor cornea that can create hundreds of implants changes that equation.\u00a0</p><p>Professor Michael Mimouni, director of the Cornea Unit in the Department of Ophthalmology at Rambam Eye Institute, led the surgical team. He described the moment as unforgettable because the lab-grown implant restored sight to a real patient for the first time.</p><p>He says, \"What this platform shows and proves is that in the lab, you can expand human cells. Then print them on any layer you need, and that tissue will be sustainable and work. We can hopefully reduce waiting times for all kinds of patients waiting for all kinds of transplants.\"</p><p>The procedure is part of an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial that assesses safety and tolerability in people with corneal endothelial disease. This achievement reflects years of work across research labs, operating rooms and industry. It also shows how coordinated teams can push new treatments from concept to clinical reality.</p><p>The breakthrough will have a permanent home in Rambam's upcoming Helmsley Health Discovery Tower. The new Eye Institute will consolidate care, training and research under one roof. It aims to speed the move from emerging science to real-world treatment for patients across Northern Israel and beyond.</p><p>Precise Bio says its <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/3d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3D printing system</a> could eventually support other tissues like cardiac muscle, liver and kidney cells. That future will require long trials and extensive validation, but the path now looks more achievable.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health/popular-weight-loss-drugs-linked-sudden-vision-loss-research-suggests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>POPULAR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS LINKED TO SUDDEN VISION LOSS, RESEARCH SUGGESTS</strong></a></p><p>If corneal disease affects someone in your family, this work brings new hope. Donor tissue may continue to play a role in many regions, but lab-grown implants offer a way to expand access where shortages hold patients back. The success of this first transplant also suggests a future where regenerative medicine supports many types of tissue repair.</p><p>This milestone also shows how long scientific breakthroughs take to reach real patients. The first 3D printed cornea design appeared in 2018 and only now reached human use. Even so, the progress feels fast when the result is restored sight.</p><p>Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand.

Every newly opened business is Somali.</p><p>Block by block, under the steady gaze of the 1970s brutalist Riverside towers, now populated mostly by Somalis, the neighborhood is losing its old identity and transforming into something that looks more like Africa than Minnesota, aside from the snow, of course.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/inside-little-mogadishu-minnesotas-somali-community-its-push-belonging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>INSIDE \u2018LITTLE MOGADISHU\u2019: MINNESOTA\u2019S BELEAGUERED SOMALI COMMUNITY UNDER A CLOUD OF FRAUD AND TRUMP ATTACKS</u></strong></a></p><p>This is not new in America.

Americans hungry for fairness will see that on display night after night.\"</p><p>\"Tony is what everyone wants in an evening-news anchor \u2013 authentic, compassionate, unafraid,\" CBS News President Tom Cibrowski said. \"He connects instantly, whether he\u2019s talking with world leaders or with families navigating difficult news in their own backyards.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/gayle-king-speaks-out-amid-reports-shes-exiting-cbs-mornings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>GAYLE KING SPEAKS OUT AMID REPORTS SHE'S EXITING \u2018CBS MORNINGS\u2019</strong></a></p><p>However, Dokoupil's appointment was not met with celebration among pundits outspoken against Israel.</p><p>\"Pro-Israel guy gets top job from new pro-Israel boss and new pro-Israel owner. Surprise!\" former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, now of Zeteo, reacted to a report that previewed Dokoupil's promotion. MSNBC changed its name officially last month to MS NOW.</p><p>\"Bari Weiss named Tony Dokoupil the new CBS Evening News anchor.

Notably, the Race and Culture Unit was gutted this fall as part of layoffs implemented by David Ellison after taking over CBS News' parent company Paramount.</p><p>The New York Post <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/10/08/media/cbs-tony-dokoupil-offers-regrets-at-teary-staff-meeting-after-grilling-anti-israel-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>also reported</u></a> that Dokoupil expressed regret to staffers at a meeting, with one network insider describing it, \"There were tears.

While Rather manned the desk for more than two decades, none of his successors have lasted longer than six years, including Katie Couric, Scott Pelley, Jeff Glor and Norah O'Donnell, who <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/norah-odonnell-exiting-cbs-evening-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stepped down</a> in January 2025 ahead of Dickerson and DuBois' brief stint.</p>",

    "content": "Not sure if there is a better place to post this. Just watched this movie for the first time actually and was immediately hooked by the concept and world building. Theres some cool parallels to draw with our world, and commentary to be made about capitalism and wealth inequality.\n\nEveryone in their world stops aging at 25 and uses their lifespan as currency. The poor struggle to even stay alive while the rich gamble and waste away decades. At the same time, people are still vulnerable to random acts of violence, so violence and robbery becomes rampant.\n\nThe movie starts off pretty strong and has a lot of positives I think, but it starts to fall apart later on. Lots of interesting concepts get brought up (a wealthy man at the beginning talks about being old enough to crave death, the poor do everything as quick as possible to make the most of time, and there are \"timekeeper\" cops to enforce rigid structure to the society).\n\nBut the movie never fully explains more from there, and then turns generic. Amanda Seyfrieds character is a rich man's daughter who almost immediately falls in love with the protagonist and joins his fight against the system. They fight the system by randomly robbing banks and distributing time.\n\nCillian Murphy also plays the main Timekeeper cop, but is oddly overzealous about enforcing a bizarrely shitty system. Hes shown to have an insane amount of loyalty to the rigid class structure *despite being born and raised in the ghetto*. He \"made it out\" somehow, but then devotes his life to making sure others don't, and then dies from it because he was still pretty damn poor as a cop.\n\nOverall still an interesting watch but just wish we got a lot more. Background on the system and more explanations would have been way better than a generic love story and cookie cutter standoff.\n\nIts been a while since this came out, but anyone else think similar?\n\n\n",

    "content": "<p>From Friday's order by Judge William Ray (N.D. Ga.) in <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.312352/gov.uscourts.gand.312352.77.0.pdf\"><em>Boston v. Williams</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Plaintiffs, acting through their attorney Loletha Denise Hale (\"Attorney Hale\"), have filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's granting of summary judgment to the Defendant on the Plaintiffs' Complaint against him. The basis for the Court's granting summary judgment was that the Plaintiffs, through the inaction of their attorney, did not display the due diligence required under Georgia law to serve the Defendant with the Complaint within the applicable statute of limitations&hellip;.</p>\n<p>Rather than simply appealing that ruling, which the Plaintiffs have every right to do, Plaintiffs now asks the Court to reconsider it on the basis of their previous argument that the Court is biased against them due to the Court's alleged bias against their lawyer, Attorney Hale. Their claim in that regard is centered on comments that the Court made at the oral argument on the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. Thus, a little review of the case history is in order.</p>\n<p>The Plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. And, in preparing for oral argument on the Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court read that brief, wherein Attorney Hale wrote (and cited case authority for the proposition) that the issue as to whether the Plaintiffs exercised due diligence in their efforts to serve the Defendant with process was a question of fact for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p>This argument was interesting and very strange. In the Presiding Judge's 35 years [by \"Presiding Judge,\" the judge presumably means himself -EV] as a member of the State Bar of Georgia, 23 which have been as a judge at the State and Federal level, it had always been his understanding that the issue of diligence in service efforts was one for the Court, not for a jury. But, as the Plaintiffs cited case precedent for this proposition, the Presiding Judge read the cited authority to see if the Plaintiffs might be right (and whether the Presiding Judge might be wrong).</p>\n<p>Upon reading the case, it was clear that it was the Plaintiffs (or rather, Attorney Hale) who were wrong. As the Defendant pointed out in his Reply Brief, an overwhelming number of the cases cited throughout the Plaintiffs' Brief in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment either were completely fabricated/hallucinated or did not stand for the proposition for which they were cited. In other words, they were fake.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360424\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>At the ensuing oral argument, Attorney Hale's explanation for the situation was just as bad: she admitted that the original brief she filed included many misrepresentations, but she contended her only mistake was filing the wrong brief. Attorney Hale represented to the Court that the original brief was drafted by her daughter (who does not appear to be an attorney) using AI. Attorney Hale contended that her daughter was helping her, as Attorney Hale was indisposed due to health issues of a friend. Attorney Hale contended that she had prepared another, real brief without false or fraudulent cases, but that she mistakenly filed with the Court the one that her daughter drafted for her that contained the AI hallucinations.</p>\n<p>This explanation was concerning to the Court. Not only had Attorney Hale filed a brief which was rife with misstatements of the law, but also she was admitting that she had her non-attorney daughter draft it for her. The Presiding Judge certainly did express his belief that her actions may have violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Additionally, at that hearing the Presiding Judge also articulated that he was particularly surprised that Attorney Hale would submit such a grievously fraudulent pleading given a previous occasion where Attorney Hale, then as a plaintiff in a case, had provided testimony in a jury trial before the same Presiding Judge that she later admitted was misleading and/or untrue.</p>\n<p>The argument on the merits of the Motion for Summary Judgment fared no better for the Plaintiffs, as it was clear that the Court likely would grant the Defendant's motion, although the Court reserved ruling. The Court also issued a show cause notice on September 8th of a possible Rule 11 violation by Attorney Hale and scheduled a hearing thereon to occur on September 29, 2025. Coincidentally (or not), the Plaintiffs thereafter filed a Motion to Recuse the Presiding Judge. The Court denied that motion in an order dated September 23, 2025.</p>\n<p>The Rule 11 Show Cause hearing wasn't particularly illuminating in explaining how the bad brief with fraudulent case cites came about, as Attorney Hale presented no evidence, such as having her daughter testify about the drafting of the brief. She also declined to make much of an argument in her defense, claiming she would rest on the record. Her basic position and tone were that the Presiding Judge was being unfair and that this was much ado about nothing.</p>\n<p>The Court issued an order on October 28, 2025, finding that Attorney Hale had, indeed, committed a Rule 11 violation. The Court exercised its discretion not to levy a fine against Attorney Hale, but did sanction her by requiring her to notify [existing] clients of the violation and also requiring her to file a notice of the violation in any case in which she appeared as counsel in the Northern District of Georgia for the next 5 years. [The Court later granted summary judgment.] &hellip;</p>\n<p>The Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration of the Order Granting Summary Judgment is largely a repackaging of the arguments which the Plaintiffs previously have made that the Presiding Judge should have recused himself and why the Defendant wasn't entitled to summary judgment on the service issue. What is new, however, it that the Plaintiffs point to a recent complaint lodged against Attorney Hale by the State Bar of Georgia regarding her filing of the AI infected brief with the Court. The Plaintiffs claim that the Presiding Judge filed a bar complaint against Attorney Hale, which allegedly further supports their position that the Presiding Judge should not have decided the merits of the Motion for Summary Judgment&hellip;.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, perhaps it would have been more advisable for the Court not to have sent the Rule 11 Order to the State Bar until after the forthcoming appeal in this case is decided. But, at the time that the Court sent the order to the State Bar, it had already issued summary judgment to the Defendant, there were no pending matters in this case, and the case had been terminated in the Court's records.</p>\n<p>In the Court's view, the actions of Attorney Hale of filing a brief loaded with hallucinated cases and incorrect statements of the law (in addition to having a non-attorney draft the brief) in an effort to convince the Court to rule in favor of the Plaintiffs on the Motion for Summary Judgment warranted investigation by the State Bar. Honesty of attorneys appearing before the Federal and State courts of Georgia is not a trivial matter.</p>\n<p>The Court was also mindful of Rule 8.3(a) of the Code of Professional Conduct applicable to lawyers in this state, which states that \"[a] lawyer having knowledge that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, should inform the appropriate professional authority.\" Given that appeals can take anywhere from 6 months to a year or longer to get a ruling, giving notice to the State Bar of this issue when the Presiding Judge did seem appropriate.</p>\n<p>This Court denies the Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration and Motion to Vacate Judgment. It contains the \"same old - same old\" allegations, supplemented only by the additional fact that the Court forwarded its Order on the Rule 11 violations to the State Bar, an act that the Presiding Judge believed he was obligated by ethical considerations to do.</p>\n<p>In closing, it's not lost on the Court that the filing of this current motion drips with irony, as the Plaintiffs are arguing that the Presiding Judge cannot be fair (or that at least the situation presents an appearance of a conflict of interest). Yet, the Plaintiffs seek another ruling from the Presiding Judge, which is seemingly acceptable\u2014as long as it's in their favor. They can't have it both ways.</p>\n<p>In any event, the best course going forward is for this matter to end in the District Court and for the Plaintiffs to take their grievances to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. If the Circuit Court agrees with the Plaintiffs and disagrees with this Court's judgment, either in how it handled this matter procedurally or in how it resolved the Motion for Summary Judgment, that is ok. This Court has no interest in this case, other than it should be decided fairly pursuant to the substantive law and consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/10/judges-having-referred-lawyer-to-state-bar-for-alleged-ai-hallucinations-doesnt-require-judge-to-recuse/\">Judge&#039;s Having Referred Lawyer to State Bar for Alleged AI Hallucinations Doesn&#039;t Require Judge to Recuse</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

    "full_content": "Their team lost.\n\nEight teen football players from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were arrested on theft charges in Florida after being caught in a brazen \"conspiracy\" to steal thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise from a Dick's Sporting Goods. The juvenile suspects had traveled to Polk County, Florida, to participate in the Prolifix Nationals tournament at the time of their apprehensions.\n\n\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) said in a press release that the incident occurred just hours before the teens were scheduled to participate in the championship game. They were handcuffed instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 10:55 am on December 6, a store manager at the Dick's Sporting Goods in Davenport contacted the sheriff's office \"after observing multiple juveniles concealing merchandise.\" PCSO deputies arrived on scene and detained all eight football players.According to authorities, the suspects split into two groups to carry out the conspiracy. Marcus Hudgens, 15, made a purchase near the front of the store and then approached his teammates, who were walking around inside. Hudgens opened his Dick's Sporting Goods bag, and the other suspects placed merchandise inside it.Daimon Johnson, 15, Mark Bryan, 15, and Ibn Mahdee Abdul Haqq, 14, then exited the store with the bag full of stolen merchandise. They were arrested upon exit. Abdul-Haqq allegedly had stolen merchandise concealed inside a black backpack, while Bryan was in possession of the bag from the store that consisted of more than $2,000 worth of stolen goods. The other five suspects were detained inside the store. This included Hudgens, Elijah Myers, 14, Tymir Speller, 15, Tymir Smith, 14, and Jacob Scott, 15. Authorities discovered a beanie hidden inside Speller's pants when he was detained, according to the press release.Photo Polk County Sheriff's OfficeThe eight teens were identified as members of the United Thoroughbreds, a youth football team located in Philadelphia. The total value of stolen merchandise totaled $2,296.07.\"These juveniles were not from Polk County, they came here from Philly for a football tournament, and instead of representing their team with pride, they chose to steal - they are Thoroughbred thieves,\" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who shamed the players in a press conference. \"Let this be clear: it doesn't matter if you're from here or visiting, if you break the law in Polk County, you will be arrested and held accountable.\"The team's coach, Raekwon Bynes, 29, responded to the store and confirmed to authorities that the teens were staying in Davenport for the championship game, the sheriff's office said. The eight suspects had no prior criminal histories and declined to provide statements to authorities. The players were transported to the Juvenile Assessment Center, and each was charged with retail theft and conspiracy to commit retail theft.Sheriff Judd congratulated the opposing team for defeating the Thoroughbreds in the championship game, stating that the Coco Tigers didn't just win but \"ran over them.\" The Thoroughbreds lost the game 26-6.",

Surge pricing has been going on for years in ride share apps, but this new iteration sees different consumers paying different prices for food items based on the app's algorithm.\n\nResearch by Groundwork Collaborative examined pricing at Target and Safeway locations and highlighted several examples. At a Target store in North Canton, Ohio, Instacart charged a customer $2.99 for Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter on a day in September, while other users paid up to $3.59 for the same jar from the same location. At a Safeway in Seattle, Instacart users were charged five different prices for turkey, with the prices varying by 23 percent.\n\nThe study found that this has been happening at Target and Safeway stores in several cities after reviewing 437 shoppers who ordered groceries through the app for in-store pickup. The practice is known as \u201cdynamic pricing,\u201d a concept that has been controversial since Uber and Lyft began raising prices for rides when demand was high, such as during rainstorms. Airlines use a similar approach, raising ticket prices when many shoppers visit their sites at once, a system called \u201csurveillance pricing.\u201d\n\nGroundwork concluded that Instacart\u2019s pricing system could cause users to spend an extra $1,200 per year on groceries. The study found that nearly three-quarters of the items surveyed were sold at different prices on the app. In a statement to the New York Post, Instacart said its price \u201ctests\u201d are not based on characteristics of shoppers and that the prices are not \u201cdynamic\u201d because they do not change in real time.\n\nThe study found significant price differences by user but said it did not uncover evidence that the app was relying on personal information, though it noted that Instacart likely has the ability to factor in demographics such as age, household income, and whether a customer is new or returning. Instacart stated that its \u201ctests\u201d are intended to help retailers \u201clearn what matters most to consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2013 ones that already apply markups \u2013 do the same online via Instacart,\u201d a spokesperson told The New York Post.",

The lawsuits focus on the fact that the department\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/20-states-push-back-as-ed-dept-hands-programs-to-other-agencies/2025/12\">signed seven agreements</a>\u00a0with four other federal agencies, allowing those agencies to handle the day-to-day management of key grant programs. Under these arrangements, the Labor Department now heads up most K-12 grant programs, distributing over $20 billion annually to schools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The National Education Association issued a ridiculous\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/trump-administration-robs-students-educational-opportunity-announcement-dismantle-department\">statement</a>\u00a0alleging that the moves are \u201cillegal, cruel, and shameful.\u201d </strong>NEA president Becky Pringle bizarrely declared, \u201cNot only do they want to starve and steal from our students\u2014they want to rob them of their futures. Nothing is more important than the success of our students, and America\u2019s educators and parents will not be silent as Trump and Linda McMahon turn their backs on our students, families, and communities to pay for billionaire tax cuts.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>American Federation of Teachers President<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/randi-weingarten-sounds-alarm-about-trump-moving-eliminate-education-dept-not-legal\">\u00a0Randi Weingarten</a>\u00a0also claims that the move is not legal. \u201cThere are lots of things about the Department of Education that are in statute,\u201d she declares, referring to funds that the department distributes to low-income families, students with disabilities, English as a Second Language learners, and work-study programs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s take a deep breath, step back, and look at the facts.</strong></p>\n\n<p>While the federal government has spent money on education and developed education policies since the 19th century, the DOE didn\u2019t become a standalone agency until 1980, when it split off from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Its creation came about when, as a sop to the National Education Association,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.the74million.org/article/analysis-the-us-department-of-education-born-in-the-nea/\">Jimmy Carter</a>\u00a0established it while running for reelection. Clearly, it was politically motivated, and in response, the NEA subsequently issued its first-ever\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/edcast/25/02/unpacking-us-department-education-what-does-it-actually-do\">endorsement</a>\u00a0in a presidential contest.</p>\n\n<p>As\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.newsbreak.com/710-wor-560450/3866153621455-what-does-trump-s-class-dismissed-mean-for-the-department-of-education\">Jay Greene</a>, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, points out, most of the programs that the DOE now administers were created before the department was established. He writes that it is \u201cjust a bureaucratic restructuring. It doesn\u2019t get rid of programs; it doesn\u2019t cut funding; it doesn\u2019t close any schools. It\u2019s just a change in the administration, not a change in the programs and services and funding delivered to America\u2019s schools.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://donnagarner.org/2-11-25-a-detailed-blueprint-to-shut-down-the-u-s-dept-of-education-by-u-s-parents-involved-in-education-uspie/\">Neal McCluskey</a>, director of the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Educational Freedom, further explains that under the restructuring, states may get money back, but with strings attached.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additionally,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.k12dive.com/news/trump-issues-march-2025-executive-order-gut-close-education-department/741790/\">President Trump</a>\u00a0says his goal is to transfer the department\u2019s primary responsibilities\u2014such as Pell Grants, Title I funding, and resources for students with disabilities\u2014to other parts of the federal government.</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is little reason to believe that moving various programs to different agencies will have any impact on schools whatsoever. Running the same programs under a different department is unlikely to affect students.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cIf that\u2019s all they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re not going to save any money, they\u2019re not going to change any policy,\u201d </strong></em>says\u00a0<a href=\"https://cbnewsletters.chalkbeat.org/p/why-trump-s-effort-to-dismantle-the-education-department-matters-very-little-and-also-quite-a-lot\">Shep Melnick</a>, a political scientist at Boston College.</p>\n\n<p>Melnick is correct. Essentially, what the feds are trying to do at this time is tantamount to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.</p>\n\n<p>What the left and the teachers\u2019 unions truly fear is that the restructuring will eventually result in the federal government completely withdrawing all educational control.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The reasons for shutting it down are numerous. </strong></p>\n\n<p>First, spending is more efficient when it is closer to the source.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-the-u-s-department-of-education-could-be-dismantled-this-is-good-news/2025/06\">Jim Blew</a>, assistant secretary of education during the first Trump administration and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, correctly notes, \u201cThis \u2018local control\u2019 message is often met by naysayers with the concern that some local districts may do worse without federal \u2018guardrails\u2019\u2014as if every school and district needs the same guardrails or that maintaining them comes with no cost. Perhaps some local districts will use their freedom to create worse outcomes (although that would be hard to do when roughly a third of our nation\u2019s 4th and 8th graders already cannot demonstrate even basic, grade-level reading or math skills), but I find it more likely that we will see committed, innovative educators improve student outcomes when freed to use federal funding as they think best.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps no one fully comprehends the DOE\u2019s uselessness and waste more than former Secretary of Education\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/betsy-devos-shut-down-the-department-of-education-trump-elon\">Betsy DeVos</a>. She contends that it shuffles money around, imposes unnecessary requirements and political agendas through its grants, and then shirks responsibility for evaluating whether any of what it does actually adds value. \u201cHere\u2019s how it works: Congress appropriates funding for education; last year, it totaled nearly $80 billion. The department\u2019s bureaucrats take in those billions, add strings and red tape, peel off a percentage to pay for themselves, and then send it down to state education agencies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary, the DOE is ineffective, incompetent, unnecessary, and costly, and does nothing to support education. Its creation was a mistake, and it should be abolished. </strong>There is no strong policy reason or constitutional basis for the federal government to be involved in K-12 education. Ultimately, America\u2019s schools would be better off without it.</p>\n\n<p>But big-government leftists and teachers\u2019 unions rely on centralized authority. It\u2019s easier for them to influence a single federal agency where they already hold sway than to compete for control across 50 states and thousands of local districts.\u00a0 And, sadly, they will get their way, as 60 U.S. Senators would have to authorize the abolition of the DOE, which will not happen.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T00:50:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 19:50</span>\n",

You\u2019ve taken a major step in making sure you leave behind a legacy and that your assets are passed down as you see fit. But that, however, is not enough. There are plenty of potential mistakes that can torpedo your estate plan. That\u2019s why you need to mobilize now to make sure your estate plan is bullet proof.</p>\n<a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28453%29_0.jpg?itok=ALWbsxxm\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28453%29_0.jpg?itok=ALWbsxxm\"><picture><figure role=\"group\" class=\"caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images\"><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2cbd9b55-517d-44c3-92d7-6561249a2b98\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_80%28453%29_0.jpg?itok=ALWbsxxm\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption><em>Inside Creative House/Shutterstock</em></figcaption></figure></picture></a>\n\n<p>So let\u2019s take a look at some of the mistakes to look out for and how to fix them.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting to Update Your Estate Plan</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Your estate plan is a living mechanism. And things change in life. Divorces happen. Falling outs happen. Loved ones pass away. New kids are born, and so on. These major life events could affect the sturdiness of your estate plan. So you need to go back in there and make the necessary changes to make sure the estate plan still adheres to your wishes.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting to Manage Beneficiaries </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Designated beneficiaries overpower what\u2019s in a will or trust. So you need to make sure you still have the right beneficiaries listed on accounts like retirement plans.</p>\n\n<p>You may have listed your spouse as the designated beneficiary to your individual retirement account (IRA), and recently went through a divorce. In this case, you may want to update the beneficiary designation.</p>\n\n<p>Or, perhaps, a designated beneficiary has passed away. With that said, many experts recommend you name more than one beneficiary.</p>\n\n<p>And to keep everything in line, here\u2019s a list of common accounts that take beneficiary listings:</p>\n\n<ul><li>insurance policies</li>\n\t<li>401(k)</li>\n\t<li>Roth 401(k)</li>\n\t<li>IRA</li>\n\t<li>Roth IRA</li>\n\t<li>brokerage accounts</li>\n\t<li>savings accounts</li>\n</ul><p>In addition, it\u2019s always important to pay close attention to how the beneficiary themselves could affect your estate plan.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Designating a Minor as a Beneficiary </strong></h2>\n\n<p>You want your children to be financially taken care of after you pass away. So naming them as beneficiaries to something like your retirement savings can seem like a no brainer.</p>\n\n<p>But that can open you up to some pitfalls. Minors can\u2019t manage large amounts of assets. In most cases, a court will have to appoint a conservator to manage the assets. And this individual may not be the person you would want to have managed your child\u2019s inheritance. In addition, the minor would take full control of the assets once they reach the age of majority (18 or 21, depending on the state). At this point, your child may or may not be capable of handling the money responsibly.</p>\n\n<p>You could bypass these issues by creating a trust and naming your child as the beneficiary. A trustee of your choice would manage the assets. And you can choose when the funds may be distributed. This could hinge on specific circumstances like once your child graduates college or holds a steady job.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Improperly Funding a Trust </strong></h2>\n\n<p>A trust is an essential part of any estate plan. Not only does it allow your assets to bypass probate but it also ensures assets are properly distributed as you wish. It\u2019s a legal entity that holds and manages these assets.</p>\n\n<p>But unless it\u2019s properly funded, it\u2019s nothing more than an empty vessel. To avoid this, you need to start by drafting your legal trust document. And you need to list all your assets by type and value. For example, you can have real estate, vehicles, bank accounts, and brokerage accounts. You also need to gather all the paperwork that proves your ownership to these assets such as financial documents, deeds, and titles. Next, open an official trust account through a financial institution. You then fund your trust by making title changes and naming the trust as the beneficiary on applicable accounts.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting About Your Digital Assets </strong></h2>\n\n<p>With so much time we spend online, we may forget we are creating virtual assets. You create an identity and share pictures of precious memories on social media. You may have a substantial amount of money in cryptocurrency. You may run a business entirely online.</p>\n\n<p>So your estate plan needs to take into account what happens to these assets after you die. So creating a digital estate plan is key.</p>\n\n<p>Start by taking inventory of your digital assets like social media profiles, emails, intellectual property, important computer files, digital media, and more. And as you would choose an executor for your estate plan, you should choose one for your digital estate plan as well. It can be the same person.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, you may want to provide access to these digital assets by using a reliable password manager and giving your trustee access. Plus, make sure you have a detailed digital estate plan document outlining exactly how you want your digital assets managed.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Failing to Prepare for Incapacitation</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Nobody wants to think about it\u2014but anything can happen in life. And you could become incapacitated and unable to make important decisions regarding your assets and health.</p>\n\n<p>You can avoid this by setting up a financial and health care power of attorney. These are people you trust who can step in to make important financial and health-related decisions in the unfortunate event that you become incapacitated.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting About Taxes </strong></h2>\n\n<p>The federal estate tax can take a bite out of your estate before it\u2019s distributed to your heirs. Luckily, this tax would only impact significantly large estates.</p>\n\n<p>For 2025, the estate tax is only levied on transferable assets valued at more than $13.99 million or $27.98 million for married couples. That is the current federal estate and gift tax exemption. For 2026, the federal estate and gift tax exemption rises to $15 million per person or $30 million per married couple.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Forgetting About Final Arrangements</strong></h2>\n\n<p>How would you like to spend your last days? In hospice? Assisted living? And when the time comes, how would you want to be remembered? Do you want to be buried or cremated? Do you want a memorial?</p>\n\n<p>All these are difficult questions. But you can save your loved ones some headaches by answering them now. You can clearly outline this in your estate plan so everything goes as you would like it to.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Bottom Line </strong></h2>\n\n<p>Drafting an estate plan is not enough. You need to continually update it. You may want to make beneficiary changes, for example. And you may have overlooked other factors, too. For example, you may want to make sure you have a digital estate plan in place. And you also want to make sure your trust is properly funded. And, importantly, you need to take a look at any tax implications. In any case, it\u2019s a good idea to review your estate plan with a trusted estate planning attorney.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T00:00:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 19:00</span>\n",

Jasmine Crockett to jump into the Senate Democratic primary in Texas, believing she will be the easiest opponent to beat.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>With Sen. John Cornyn facing a tough three-way primary and Democrats fielding two strong candidates, Republican strategists reportedly were concerned the race would be tougher than expected. They feared a draining fight could leave the nominee wounded before the real battle against the Democrats even began.</p>\n\n<p>Back in July, the NRSC commissioned a private poll that \u201cby design\u201d included Crockett\u2019s name among the Democratic contenders. <strong>Her numbers surprised everyone: she topped the field. Instead of treating it as an internal curiosity, GOP operatives moved fast.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen we saw the results, we were like, \u2018OK, we got to disseminate this far and wide,\u2019\u201d a source told NOTUS.</p>\n\n<p>In June news broke that Texas Democrats Colin Allred, James Talarico, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Rep. Joaquin Castro met to discuss the 2026 election.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Operatives at the NRSC realized that Crockett \u2014 whose political stock had been rising \u2014 wasn\u2019t included in that meeting and also hadn\u2019t been included in any credible poll. So they decided to change that.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following the NRSC\u2019s polls, other surveys began to include Crockett and showed similar results: She was surging in the primary.</p>\n\n<p>The NRSC then worked to amplify those polls and is taking credit for helping \u201corchestrate the pile on of these polling numbers to really drive that news cycle and that narrative that Jasmine Crockett was surging in Texas,\u201d the source said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And Crockett took the bait.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe more I saw the poll results, I couldn\u2019t ignore the trends that were clear,\u201d she said later, tying her Senate bid directly to the polling wave Republicans had manufactured for her. It was the political equivalent of bait left in plain sight. And she took it.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Behind the curtain, the NRSC operatives had built an entire ecosystem to sustain their creation. </strong>The source called it an \u201cAstroTurf recruitment process,\u201d as the NRSC had allies who were \u201cseeding these new polls pretty aggressively into progressive digital spaces.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>They even coordinated text messages and phone calls to Democratic activists, urging them to call Crockett\u2019s office and push her to run. <strong>Each round of organized \u201cencouragement\u201d added to the illusion of an organic movement. A small feedback loop spun into a statewide phenomenon.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, internal GOP numbers showed Cornyn trailing Attorney General Ken Paxton badly in a three-way primary that also included Wesley Hunt. Paxton polled as a general-election liability; Hunt wasn\u2019t ready for a statewide fight. The GOP couldn\u2019t afford to risk a damaged nominee in a cycle where Democrats had real contenders in Allred and Talarico. So national Republicans recalibrated. If their incumbent had vulnerabilities, they could balance the math by softening up the other side.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That meant turning Jasmine Crockett\u2014a loud, anti-Trump social-media darling with a taste for cable brawls\u2014into the presumptive Democratic frontrunner. She was tailor-made for the part Republicans wanted cast: a polarizing progressive who would turn off swing voters in a Texas general election.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Then the miracle happened. Allred, once the strongest Democrat in the field,<a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2025/12/08/colin-allred-withdraws-senate-run-house/\"> suddenly exited the Senate race</a> to run for the House, effectively ceding the primary to Crockett. Crockett <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/elections/2025/12/07/jasmine-crockett-expected-to-launch-senate-campaign-ahead-of-candidate-filing-deadline/\">announced her campaign the same day</a>, citing the same polling trends the NRSC had seeded months earlier.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Crockett\u2019s campaign has admittedly gotten off to a rocky start. Her campaign launch video became an unintentional punchline, and despite her high profile and large campaign war chest, Senate Democrats<a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2025/12/09/senate-democrats-jasmine-crockett-decline-comment/\"> aren\u2019t lining up to endorse her</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But Republicans aren\u2019t done shoring her up. </strong></p>\n\n<p>They are actively exploring ways to sustain her momentum long enough to secure the Democratic nomination. That means quiet talks with outside conservative-aligned groups about launching \u201cindependent expenditure\u201d efforts that appear progressive on paper, with the sole purpose of propping up her campaign.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crockett frames her Senate run as destiny, powered by the people.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The irony is, those \u201cpeople\u201d were Republican operatives running call lists from D.C., testing whether they could turn raw data into a political force that worked in their favor. They could. And they did.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T23:35:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 18:35</span>\n",

James will argue that such letters are common and merely express how her office will interpret the law in these areas in light of questions from various boards.</p>\n\n<p>It states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cBoard members may be removed by the commissioner of education if they, (1) violate the education law or another law \u2018pertaining to [public] schools,\u2019 including the state Human Rights Law; (2) willfully neglect their duties as public officers; or (3) willfully disobey a \u2018decision, order, rule or regulation\u2019 of the Regents or the commissioner of education.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>The question is whether a court will find the letter itself insufficient to trigger a lawsuit, rather than waiting to see how that legal guidance is applied in any given case.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Putting aside the merits of the legal cause of action, the letter should raise free speech concerns. It seems designed to intimidate some who want to raise these policies while giving others support for shutting down debates. Polls show that the public is generally opposed to transgender policies on pronouns, sports, and bathroom access.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The letter emphasizes that free speech can be limited at these meetings:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201c[u]nder the First Amendment, school board meetings are considered limited public fora. This means that school boards that allow public comment \u2018may make reasonable, view-neutral rules governing the content of speech allowed,\u2019 including prohibiting all comments on a particular topic that would have discriminatory, harassing, or bullying effects.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>James leaves the scope of what would be considered \u201cdiscriminatory, harassing, or bullying effects\u201d lingering without any clear definition. <strong>It is the same vagueness in standards that we have seen used in higher education where administrators have succeeded in getting students to self-censor to avoid the unknown lines of speech regulation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In other words, the letter is giving these boards guidance on how to stop public debate in their meetings on issues that are currently unpopular and leading to rising opposition among parents and students.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The timing of the letter before the midterm elections only magnifies suspicions that James is nudging boards to prohibit all comments on these divisive issues.</strong></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T23:10:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 18:10</span>\n",

The years, as I like to say, gradually teach things the days don\u2019t notice.</p>\n\n<p>Such context cannot be downloaded, transferred or absorbed through an AI tool, which, by its very title, can never be a genuine substitute for earned (and therefore, actual) intelligence.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Gaining Perspective</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Having traversed years of complex market forces, themes and instruments (from\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/gold-vs-an-openly-rigged-failing-financial-system\"><strong>derivative timebombs</strong></a><strong>\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/making-sense-of-comex-insanity\"><strong>COMEX tricks</strong></a>\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/banking-risk-the-real-killer-virus\"><strong>banking risks</strong></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/open-madness-in-global-bond-markets-got-gold\"><strong>bond market signals</strong></a>), I, like many others, have acquired certain, well, Jaded perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>This, of course, also includes biases, of which I am no less guilty.</p>\n\n<p>Experience nevertheless allows for recognizing occasional lighthouses amidst the otherwise intentional fog of data overload, obfuscation, and noise. In short, and without crystal balls or a genius IQ, we can endeavor to derive the simple from the complex, and then act upon that simplicity with a modest degree of understanding.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Patterns Repeating Themselves</strong></h2>\n\n<p>As we approach the end of 2025, we are seeing, yet again, certain familiar and simple patterns which can serve as potential lighthouses for those endeavoring to navigate so much admitted fog.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We all recognize, for example, debt levels screaming well beyond the Rubicon of the sustainable, resulting in further and familiar currency debasement, ripping (and predictable) gold prices, metals exchanges running out of metals, escalating geopolitical tensions and risk assets defying the gravity of fair valuation by literally every metric, from the Buffet and Shiller indicators to the NVDA market cap.</p>\n\n<p>And for years, we\u2019ve tracked these and countless other themes, both complex and simple, exciting and less exciting, together\u2014yet always free to make our own conclusions from the patterns, facts, numbers and themes presented.</p>\n\n<p>Below, I address two themes from 2025 which tell us much as we head toward a future riddled with increasing landmines as well as opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, I am referring to:\u00a0<strong>(1)</strong>\u00a0insider stock selling and\u00a0<strong>(2)</strong>\u00a0a potential revaluation plan hiding beneath the Strategic BTC Reserve Order.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Insider Selling: The Rats Leaving a Sinking Ship</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Although an ardent capitalist, I have, over the years, been critical of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/dying-capitalism-the-new-feudalism\"><strong>neo-feudalism</strong></a>\u00a0which has\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/the-death-of-capitalism\"><strong>replaced free-market capitalism</strong></a>\u00a0in what I have critiqued as an unhealthy and rigged-to-fail game of insider lords and Main Street serfs.</p>\n\n<p>The lords of finance and politics have long ago accepted that it was better to \u201cbe inside\u201d than to do the \u201cright thing\u201d when it came to monopoly powers, fractional reserve banking, asset-bubble creation, the repeal of Glass Steagall, the deregulation of derivatives, stock buy-backs or appalling management/employee salary ratios, all of which objectively defy greed and creep toward pathology.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Such laws of markets and human nature will likely never change, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t prepare ourselves for the consequences of this gamed system.</p>\n\n<p>What many have not noticed from 2024 to now, however, is the astronomical level of insider selling of publicly traded stocks.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Massive Selling</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Beginning in 2024, for example, Jeffrey Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Jamie Dimon, and the Walton family, along with numerous other C-suite denizens, have individually and collectively been selling billions worth of their own shares at the top of a market they knew was grotesquely over-valued and heading straight for a recession.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the $464B of insider selling in 2024, which continued well into 2025, was the highest level of insider dumping ever seen, save for the $650B of similar dumping in 2007, a year before the Great Financial Crisis sent the global financial system to its knees in 2008.</p>\n\n<p>This (and not \u201cestate planning,\u201d \u201cphilanthropy\u201d or \u201cdiversification\u201d) was why a banking CEO like Jamie Dimon, otherwise a vocal proponent of long-term holdings yet intimately aware of defaulting loan and consumer credit signals, was selling $150M worth of his own Morgan Chase stock for the first time in 18 years.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>And Bezos dumping $13B worth of his Amazon shares or Ellison taking $3B off his Oracle account while Zuckerberg cashed in a 2024 personal Meta stake of $50B came from the same motives and knowledge of the NVDA insiders who were simultaneously dumping their shares at record levels and all-time-high valuations.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This was not diversification or coincidental profit taking; it was shared recognition that their valuations, priced to perfection, were heading toward a crisis.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2><strong>History Rhyming</strong></h2>\n\n<p>This, of course, is a familiar playbook. From Countrywide Mortgage to Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, we saw similar insider dumping in 2007\u2014and it always came\u00a0<em>before</em>\u00a0rather than\u00a0<em>after</em>\u00a0they tanked.</p>\n\n<p>The sell-offs quietly marking 2024 and continuing into 2025 are, at least to me, a signal that the rats are jumping ship months before the market bow dips beneath the equity waterline.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s even more telling is that the sell-to-buy ratios behind these insider sales had skyrocketed to ratios of 9:1 and even 12:1 in 2024, the highest in history, against an average healthy rate of 3:1.</p>\n\n<p><em>Do you see a sell signal?</em></p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Emergency Plan Hiding in Plain Sight?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>2025 was also year of headline-making executive orders promoted to make America great again.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of one\u2019s politics, however, we can all agree that when the interest expense on America\u2019s public debt exceeds $1.2T (well above its annual military budget), there\u2019s a giant and economy-crushing elephant in the room.</p>\n\n<p>As I\u2019ve warned from the writings of\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/the-philosophy-of-debt-the-math-of-precious-metals\"><strong>18th-century mathematicians</strong></a>\u00a0to 21st-century Debt/GDP ratios, there\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYXmAJsdEAQ\"><strong>no longer an easy solution</strong></a>\u00a0to such historically unprecedented debt and hence currency traps.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we\u2019ve reached the desperation stage.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the evidence of\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/brics-vs-trump-whose-the-real-sucker\"><strong>a world steadily turning away from the USD</strong></a>\u00a0and toward physical gold as a superior strategic reserve asset is not a theory but a fact, one confirmed from the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/comex-flows-is-the-gold-case-almost-too-obvious\"><strong>COMEX</strong></a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/the-brics-wont-kill-the-dollar-us-policy-will\"><strong>BRICS</strong></a>\u00a0to the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/latest-treasury-fed-and-bis-reports-confirm-all-twisted-paths-lead-to-gold\"><strong>BIS</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>In this backdrop of such largely ignored yet empirically mathematical realism, came a flurry of executive orders to keep the headlines positive while the experts scurried for alleged solutions. But was there a deeper \u201cplan\u201d behind all this?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Is Something Hiding Within the Strategic Reserve BTC Order?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>One so-called solution, of course, was the March 2025 Strategic BTC Reserve Order, intended to be codified by a subsequent Act of Congress. Like all desperate legislation in the face of an objective debt crisis, this gold play, carefully hiding under a BTC mask, showed its sunny side and \u201cdigital future\u201d to the media while hiding a darker side (of centralized control) in carefully worded sabotage.</p>\n\n<p>Tucked, for example, within the language of this and other so-called odes to a \u201cdecentralized future of digital efficiency\u201d and \u201cdigital gold\u201d was a provision which hid the hints of a planned and centralized currency debasement. This hidden skunk in the woodpile is now waiting for an inevitable \u201cuh-oh\u201d moment to trigger it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the crypto language of 2025 contains a lot of talk regarding \u201cstrategic reserve assets,\u201d which, of course, referred to BTC, but which some feel was just a cover story. But if you dig deeper into this definition within the Federal Reserve Register,\u00a0<em>\u201cstrategic reserve assets\u201d</em>\u00a0do not explicitly include\u00a0<em>\u201cmonetary metals\u201d</em>\u00a0\u2013 i.e., gold and silver.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In fact, under US law and Fed regulations, there is no statutory or regulatory definition of \u201cstrategic reserve assets\u201d that covers metals, BTC or any other assets in a general sense.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Fed, does, however, publish policy guidance on the composition of FX reserves and the gold holdings within the Treasury\u2019s \u201cExchange Stabilization Fund\u201d \u2013 a veritable \u201cslush fund\u201d created by the profits FDR made from his $2.8B gold confiscation of citizen metals/wealth in 1933\u2026</p>\n\n<p>This is no coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>Unbeknownst to most, the powers floating around all this crypto legislation allows the Treasury Department to acquire, manage and value these reserve assets for \u201cnational security.\u201d This is clever legalese for: The government, subsequent to altering official statements, can, at its discretion, later devalue, re-value and/or acquire these assets whenever the $#!7 hits the next fan\u2026</p>\n\n<h2><strong>We\u2019ve Seen This Movie Before</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In case you think such a tin-foil-hatted suggestion smacks in the face of American freedoms, please know that such a playbook for emergency gold re-valuation and dollar-debasement is nothing new at all.</p>\n\n<p>In 1933, when FDR faced a debt crisis of \u201cnational security\u201d (due, of course, to the banking and leverage practices of the roaring 20\u2019s), he was able by executive order (6102) to not only confiscate citizen gold at the $20.00 market price, but 9 months later, having taken his citizens\u2019 gold, to then reset the price higher at $35.00/ounce. He then placed the billions he \u201cacquired\u201d into the same ESF \u201cslush fund\u201d still at play today.</p>\n\n<p>Overnight, your government thus devalued the dollar by 69%, which made it easier to pay down Uncle Sam\u2019s debt after robbing the gold and debasing the dollar by which its citizens measured their wealth.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Concerns\u2026</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Such clever yet complex legislative theft, of course, was no shocker. All debtors, including Uncle Sam, prefer a debased currency to pay down fixed debt.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I have some concerns that the same playbook of 1933 is now quietly in motion today, only the debt levels are much higher and the potential debasement to come would be much harsher for Joe Six-Pack.</p>\n\n<p>Why the concern? Because desperate governments have shown their true faces before, and they are more desperate today than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>Uncle Sam, for example, knows that he is approaching $40T of public debt, which no one in the world, including the White House, believes can ever be repaid\u2014at least not unless he finds some equity real fast. This is because more Fed money printing is becoming politically embarrassing and globally distrusted, as gold is now held by more central banks than USTs.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>The Hidden Piggy Bank</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Currently, and conveniently, the US sits on over 260 million ounces of gold reserves whose certificates have been priced at $42.22/oz since 1973, creating a current value of $11B, which we all know is peanuts when measured against trillion-dollar debt levels.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, we should at least be concerned of a move to one day re-value those certificates higher, much higher, to give Uncle Sam some needed cash.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>But rather than just reprice those certificates to the market price for a trillion or so of fast cash (also peanuts), it\u2019s possible that the Fed, in conjunction with the US Treasury, would reprice those certificates much higher, as they did in 1933.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, and thanks to the hidden language above, they could legally reprice gold at $20,000, a deliberate number which would revalue those gold certificates from $11B to $5.2T, which is closer to the valuation needed to stabilize (i.e. match the assets and liabilities) of the USA\u2019s most liquid M0 monetary base (cash + bank reserves at the Fed) of $6.7T.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What\u2019s Good for Government is Bad for the Governed\u00a0</strong></h2>\n\n<p>In other words, and by one emergency action taken in a moment of \u201cnational security\u201d (i.e., an act of war, rate spikes or market implosion), the US could unilaterally re-establish a shadow \u201cgold standard light\u201d on its M0 monetary base.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Such an \u201cemergency measure\u201d would restore faith in Uncle Sam\u2019s otherwise unloved Treasury bonds without having to \u201cprint\u201d a single dollar at the Fed nor issue a single IOU from the Treasury. It\u2019s basically \u201cgolden QE.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But as in 1933, that same emergency measure would mean an absolutely disastrous devaluation of the USD by 80%. Such debasement would hit the man (and savers) on the street square in the gut, while rescuing the government at their expense.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Shocking? Unthinkable? Koo-Koo? Well, we\u2019ve seen this movie and playbook before, less than a century ago\u2014it\u2019s just that so few read history\u2026</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Insiders Building Their Arcs Before the Rain</strong></h2>\n\n<p>As in 1933, the current government and the commercial banks aligned with it would need to hold this physical gold\u00a0<em>before</em>\u00a0it was repriced.\u00a0In my admittedly jaded mind, hints of this were signaled (and prepared) three years ago when the\u00a0<a href=\"https://vongreyerz.gold/gold-basel-iii-trillion-dollar-question\"><strong>Basel III rules</strong></a>\u00a0conveniently classified allocated, physical gold with Tier-1 asset status.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This made gold equal to risk-free money\u00a0<em>prior</em>\u00a0to the uh-oh moment (of \u201cnational security\u201d) they know is coming. The BIS was effectively helping itself and the banking system build their Arc of PHYSICAL GOLD before the flood of deliberate dollar debasement under a gold revaluation plan.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Real Gold Matters More than Ever</strong></h2>\n\n<p>If this \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d is true or at least plausible, it serves as yet another obvious reason to never \u201cown\u201d gold in an ETF or futures contract.

And unlike the Fed, this one was not nearly as good for risk assets: the company reported earnings which beat estimates, but the top line was a mess, with cloud growth missing across the board, and margins also disappointing, sending the stock lower after hours.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Here is what Oracle just reported for Q2:</em></p>\n\n<ul><li>Adjusted EPS $2.26 vs. $1.47 y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates of $1.64\n\n\t<ul><li>The company clarified that GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share \"were both positively impacted by a $2.7 billion pre-tax gain in the sale of Oracle's interest in our Ampere chip company.\"</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Adjusted revenue $16.06 billion, +14% y/y, <strong>missing </strong>estimates of $16.21 billion\n\t<ul><li>Cloud revenue (IaaS plus SaaS) $8.0 billion, +36% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate $8.04 billion</li>\n\t\t<li>Cloud Infrastructure revenue (IaaS) $4.1 billion, +71% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates of $4.09 billion</li>\n\t\t<li>Cloud Application revenue (SaaS) $3.9 billion, +11% y/y, <em><strong>matching </strong></em>estimates of $3.9 billion</li>\n\t\t<li>Software revenue $5.88 billion, -3.1% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimates of $6.03 billion</li>\n\t\t<li>Hardware revenue $776 million, +6.6% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates of $716.7 million</li>\n\t\t<li>Service revenue $1.43 billion, +7.4% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates of $1.36 billion<br />\n\t\t\u00a0</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Revenue in constant currency +13%, <strong>missing </strong>estimates of +14.6%\n\t<ul><li>Cloud revenue (IaaS plus SaaS) in constant currency +33%, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +35.1%</li>\n\t\t<li>Cloud Infrastructure revenue (IaaS) in constant currency +66%, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +69.1%</li>\n\t\t<li>Cloud Application revenue (SaaS) in constant currency +11%, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimate +12.4%<br />\n\t\t\u00a0</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Adjusted operating income $6.72 billion, +10% y/y, <em><strong>beating </strong></em>estimates $6.82 billion</li>\n\t<li>Adjusted operating margin 42% vs. 43% y/y, <em><strong>missing </strong></em>estimates of 42.2%</li>\n\t<li>Remaining performance obligations $523 billion, <em><strong>up 15% and beating </strong></em>est of $519.4BN\u00a0</li>\n</ul><p>Commenting on the quarter, Larry Ellison said that \"we are now committed to a policy of chip neutrality where we work closely with all our CPU and GPU suppliers. Of course, we will continue to buy the latest GPUs from NVIDIA, but we need to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy,\u201d said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison. The question, of course, is where will the money come from for the company which has spooked the stock - and especially bond market - with its CDS soaring to the highest since the GFC, as markets realized that ORCL will need to issue a lot more debt to fund its capex.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Ellison also said that \u201cOracle sold Ampere because we no longer think it is strategic for us to continue designing, manufacturing and using our own chips in our cloud datacenters.\"</p>\n\n<p>There was the token AI pitch of course: \"There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) increased by $68 billion in Q2\u2014up 15% sequentially to $523 billion\u2014highlighted by new commitments from Meta, NVIDIA, and others,\" said Oracle Principal Financial Officer, Doug Kehring.</p>\n\n<p>So what to make of these results? Well, as we noted in our preview, while three months ago, Oracle\u2019s scorching earnings outlook sent the shares soaring to their best day in three decades, today things look very different for the database software maker and the AI trade in general.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Heading into today's earnings report, ORCL shares plunged 33%\u00a0since Sept. 10 (and more than 40% at the lows), when they hit an all-time high based on enthusiasm for raging growth in its cloud business. Today, Oracle and many other artificial intelligence companies are facing a wave of skepticism due to heavy capital expenditures and the circular nature of some arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>Today's results were mixed at best: yes earnings beat, but Oracle posted disappointing cloud revenue, signaling it will take longer than expected for the company\u2019s recent huge AI bookings to pay off.\u00a0 As noted above, Q2 cloud sales increased 34% to $7.98 billion, while revenue in the company\u2019s closely watched infrastructure business increased 68% to $4.08 billion. Both numbers fell just short of analysts estimates.</p>\n\n<p>The silver lining: Oracle's remaining performance obligation, a measure of bookings, jumped to $523 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended Nov. 30, the company said Wednesday in a\u00a0statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $519 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, ORCL needs to start monetizing this backlog instead of just parading with how much it may collect at some point in the future.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Oracle has found recent success in the competitive cloud computing market. It\u2019s engaging in a massive data center build-out to power AI work for\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0and also counts companies such as ByteDance\u2019s TikTok and\u00a0Meta Platforms as major cloud customers.</p>\n\n<p>Still, as Bloomberg notes, Wall Street has raised doubts about the costs and time lines required to develop AI infrastructure at such a massive scale. Oracle has taken out massive sums of debt and committed to leasing multiple data center sites; its off-balance sheet debt is also emerging as a potential risk.</p>\n\n<p>Investors want to see Oracle turn its higher spending on new data center infrastructure into revenue as quickly as it has promised. <strong>Capital expenditures, a metric of data center spending, were about $12 billion in the quarter, an increase from $8.5 billion in the preceding period</strong>. Analysts anticipated $8.25 billion in capital spending in the quarter.\u00a0\u00a0In September, the company projected capital expenditures of $35 billion for the fiscal year.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%20capex.jpg?itok=OhRMEA34\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%20capex.jpg?itok=OhRMEA34\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"7adf0105-a021-4bd5-b535-21037f441b04\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"306\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ORCL%20capex.jpg?itok=OhRMEA34\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Part of the negative sentiment from investors in recent weeks is tied to increased skepticism about the business prospects of OpenAI, which is seeing more competition from companies like Google, wrote Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, in a note ahead of earnings. Investors would like to see Oracle management explain how they could adjust spending plans if demand from OpenAI changed, he added.</p>\n\n<p>But the biggest question, however, is the one we flagged earlier: where/when will the money to fund all this massive capex growth come from... and it better not be all debt because in that case the Barclays bear case of zero cash in late 2026 comes into play and ORCL's CDS will go straight up. The company better have a ready answer during the earnings call\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>ORCL shares slumped 6% in after hours after closing at $223.27 in New York.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%202025-12-10_13-24-48.jpg?itok=l-T0XlBH\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%202025-12-10_13-24-48.jpg?itok=l-T0XlBH\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"fe66086a-cfe1-4ef6-842a-590831c032de\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"294\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ORCL%202025-12-10_13-24-48.jpg?itok=l-T0XlBH\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T21:38:37+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 16:38</span>\n",

Only two days after India backpedaled on its plan to force smartphone makers to preinstall a state-run \u201ccybersecurity\u201d app, Reuters reports that the country is back at it. It\u2019s said to be considering a telecom industry proposal with another draconian requirement. This one would require smartphone makers to enable always-on satellite-based location tracking (Assisted GPS).</p>\n\n<p>The measure would require location services to remain on at all times, with no option to switch them off. The telecom industry also wants phone makers to disable notifications that alert users when their carriers have accessed their location. According to Reuters, India\u2019s home ministry was set to meet with smartphone industry executives on Friday, but the meeting was postponed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>#8</strong>\u00a0A journalist in the Netherlands has tested AI-powered glasses\u00a0<a href=\"https://x.com/pascal_bornet/status/1997215380423495938\">\u201cthat can instantly identify strangers on the street\u201d</a>\u2026</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Dutch journalist just tested a pair of AI-powered glasses that can instantly identify strangers on the street.</p>\n\n<p>No government database.

Now we need to see what Powell says for the full read\u201d</li>\n\t<li>25bp cut - still 1 cut in 2026 and 1 in 2027, as expected</li>\n\t<li>Statement language changed to 'in considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments' as expected.</li>\n\t<li>Schmidt and Goolsbee hawkish dissents (in line - plus Miran for a larger cut, so 3 total)</li>\n\t<li>In the dot plot, have 6 hawkish dissents for next year \u2013 more than Goldman expected</li>\n\t<li>Fed have also announced resumption of purchases to keep balance sheet steady - <strong>they put that right in the statement</strong></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Mike Cahill, Macro FX Research at Goldman:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This all looks very close to GS expectations, so will come down to Powell's presentation in the press conference. I'm most interested in how he characterizes the debate on the Committee and risks to the labor market--what would it take for them to be ready to move again. Most notably to me in that context, they've kept their forecast for the Q4 unemployment rate average at 4.5%. That implies a much slower rate of increase than we've been seeing lately. The current rate is 4.44%, so this requires a little less than 5bp a month to meet the median. 7ppl expect it too move up to 4.6-4.7, which would be in line with the recent average. The GDP forecast for this year also implies they are penciling in a pretty big hit to growth in Q4 and a decent transfer into next year so a sizeable hit from the shutdown presumably.\u00a0On net, I would characterize that labor market forecast as optimistic rather than obviously hawkish, but it will depend on how much weaker it would need to be to get the Committee to reconsider that \"extent and timing\" of additional easing. I expect Powell will convey that the hurdle is relatively high given the 6 soft dissents already, but will see whether he brings up some of those risks more than he did in October.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Anna Wong,\u00a0Bloomberg Chief Economist:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe assess the overall tone of the statement and updated projections as leaning dovish \u2014 though there are some hawkish undertones. On the dovish side, the committee sharply revised up the growth trajectory while lowering the inflation outlook, and kept the dot plot unchanged. The FOMC also announced the commencement of reserve-management purchases. On the other hand, there\u2019s a signal in the policy statement that suggests the committee is inclined for an extended hold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Even though the dot plot shows just one 25-bp cut in 2026 \u2014 markets are pricing two \u2014 our view is that the Fed will end up cutting by 100 bps next year. </strong>That\u2019s because we anticipate weak payroll growth and currently see scant signs of an inflation resurgence in the first half of 2026.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Ira Jersey,\u00a0Bloomberg Rates Strategist </strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWhat the Federal Reserve seems to have forgotten is that reserve balances are either ample, or not. If the Fed wants to maintain an ample supply of reserves, I\u2019m still unsure why it isn\u2019t considering temporary open-market operations around tax days and other periods when reserve balances tend to fall as the TGA rises. Doing permanent operations is more difficult to explain to market participants, and although we understand the need for slow increases on the asset side of the balance sheet -- similar to, but larger than, pre-2007 operations -- we think using traditional repos to calibrate reserve demand would be a good way to right-size asset purchases.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Seema Shah, Principal Asset Management:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWith the recent scarcity of economic data and the wide dispersion in neutral rate estimates, it is hard to imagine any level of confidence in the economy that would lead to unanimous Fed voting.\u00a0We expect the Fed to pause and assess the lagged effects of prior tightening. While some additional easing is likely in 2026, it will probably be marginal and contingent on greater confidence\u2014and evidence\u2014regarding the health of the US economy.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Luzzetti, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank: </strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I'd want to ask Chair Powell if the committee has already internalized some of the weakness expected in next week\u2019s belated jobs data. I\u2019d like to get confirmation from the chair today.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Raphael Thuin, Tikehau Capital:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWith limited visibility on the data path, policymakers are forced to balance softening labor signals against the need to keep inflation moving lower. The result is greater policy uncertainty\u2014likely a key driver of market volatility as we approach 2026.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Jim Bianco, Bianco Research:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A big issue is that the US will have a new Fed chair next year. And the new chair may be perceived as having a political agenda. That\u2019s why I wanted to see more dissents to signal that they were ready, willing and able to be that political break. Maybe they will once we get that new Fed chairman but then that looks political that they didn\u2019t take the chance to do it before the new guy came.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Richard Flynn, Charles Schwab UK</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cBy acting pre-emptively, the Fed is signaling caution in the face of mounting downside risks, particularly as global growth remains sluggish and policy uncertainty persists. For investors, this is a measured adjustment rather than a dramatic pivot. While the cut could offer near-term support for risk assets, and potentially fuel a seasonal \u2018Santa rally\u2019, volatility is likely to remain elevated as markets assess the implications for future policy and the broader economic outlook.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Source: Bloomberg</em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-10T20:30:12+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 15:30</span>\n",

Large tanker, very large. Largest one ever seized in action. And, other things are happening. So, you\u2019ll be seeing that later. And you\u2019ll be talking about that later with some other people,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nTrump said the tanker was seized \u201cfor a very good reason,\u201d but provided no further details. Asked what would happen to the ship\u2019s cargo of oil, he replied, \u201cWell, we keep it, I guess.\u201d\n\nA U.S. official said the seizure was \u201cled by the Coast Guard and supported by the U.S Navy.\u201d\n\nAnother official told the New York Times that the oil tanker is named \u201cSkipper\u201d and was \u201ccarrying a false flag of nationality\u201d at the time it was seized.\n\n\u201cIt was seized because of its past links to smuggling illicit Iranian oil, not because of ties to the Maduro regime, although it was carrying Venezuelan oil. A federal judge authorized a seizure warrant for the tanker roughly two weeks ago,\u201d the official said.\n\nUK-based maritime risk company Vanguard confirmed on Wednesday there is an oil tanker named Skipper that was sanctioned by the United States for allegedly being involved with the illegal trade of Iranian oil under another name, \u201cAdisa.\u201d\n\nAn unnamed source told Politico that \u201cthe ship was en route to Cuba, where the state firm Cubametales was planning to sell it to Asian energy brokers.\u201d Due to U.S. sanctions, most of Venezuela\u2019s oil product is sold to China.\n\nVenezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro did not directly address the tanker seizure in a belligerent speech he gave on Wednesday afternoon. He said during the speech that Venezuela\u2019s military is \u201cprepared to break the teeth of the North American empire, if necessary.\u201d\n\nInternational oil prices rose modestly on news of the seizure. Industry analysts said oil buyers would need time to learn the exact circumstances of the seizure, and if any Venezuelan oil was loaded aboard the ship, before calculating the impact on the availability of Venezuelan crude.",

    "full_content": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d Erika Kirk, the Turning Point USA CEO and widow of assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, addressed online conspiracies around her husband\u2019s murder.\n\nKirk said, \u201cIt reminds me so much of Chapter Six in the book of Nehemiah. He is building a wall, and the townspeople are at the base of that hill saying, \u2018Nehemiah,\u2019 calling him all these names, saying all these things, \u2018Come on down,\u2019 Every single time, he had the same message four times in a row: \u2018I cannot come down. I am busy building.\u2019 That is how I feel.\n\nShe continued, \u201cI do not have time to address the noise. My silence does not mean that I am complacent. My silence does not mean that somehow Turning Point USA and all of the handpicked staff that loved my husband and my husband loved them is somehow in on it. We are busy building. And you know what I thought? I thought these people are human. We are all grieving in our own way. And they are trying to find the answer to something that happened that was so evil. They are trying so hard. And I get that. We\u2019re doing the same. Anytime we hear a lead or anytime we hear anything, we send it to the authorities. Please dig into this. No rock will be unturned. I want justice for my husband, for myself, for my family more than anyone else out there.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cSo for me, you want to keep telling me to come down while we\u2019re building, I don\u2019t have time for that. But here\u2019s my breaking point on that. Come after me, call me names \u2014 I don\u2019t care. Call me what you want, go down that rabbit hole \u2014 whatever. But when you go after my family, my Turning Point USA family, my Charlie Kirk Show family, when you go after the people that I love, and you\u2019re making hundreds and thousands of dollars every single episode going after the people that I love because somehow they\u2019re in on this? No.\u201d\n\nHost Harris Faulkner said, \u201cYou know, I have to say it: I\u2019ve never seen you like this.\u201d\n\nKirk said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m very-, this is righteous anger because this is not okay, it\u2019s not healthy. This is a mind virus. Yes, I believe in our judicial system. I do. We have a hell of a team working on this, excuse my French. But this is not okay.\u201d\n\nFaulkner said, \u201cSo you want to put these people back in the box where they\u2019ve been creeping from?\u201d\n\nKirk said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what box you\u2019re in. But just know that your words are very powerful and we are human. My team are not machines and they\u2019re not robots. They are human. We have more death threats on our team and our side than I have ever seen. I have kidnapping threats. I have-, you name it, we have it. And my poor team is exhausted. And every time they bring this back up, what are we supposed to do? Relive that trauma all over again? They watched my husband get murdered. I have no idea how I would have reacted if I was there that day. And thank the good Lord that I did not have to see that happen. But my team, they are rocked to the core. So why every single day do they have to be dragged through the mud, analyzed, hyperanalyzed?\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAnd if people think that I was just gonna wilt away, I\u2019m not gonna sit in a corner, and cry, and be in fetal position. This is a duty to my husband and it\u2019s an absolute honor, and I will never back down. And so my message to them is to stop. To stop.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

During his brief tenure as head coach, the Wolverines went 16-8.\n\nOn3 reports that Michigan players were called in for an unscheduled team meeting where they were informed of Moore\u2019s firing. Michigan Athletic Director Warde Manuel then announced that Morre had been fired for cause after a university investigation found \u201ccredible evidence that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\u201d according to his statement.\n\n\u201cSherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\u201d Manuel said in a statement. \u201cFollowing a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and UM maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\u201d\n\nBiff Poggi, who served as interim head coach during Moore\u2019s two-game suspension this year, will serve as interim head coach.\n\nManuel told team staff that the investigation into Moore had been ongoing since mid-November.\n\nThe Wolverines, currently ranked 18th, had an up-and-down season as they sought to break in new, young talent, specifically true freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood. A mid-season rally seemed ot put Michigan in a position to break into the 12-team bracket, but a 27-9 beatdown at the hands of archrival Ohio State put their playoff hopes to rest.\n\nMoore arrived at Michigan in 2018 as a tight ends coach and moved up to co-offensive coordinator in 2021. In 2023, he became the full-time offensive coordinator during a tumultuous year where a sign-stealing scandal rocked the program. Moore served as head coach for the Wolverines while Jim Harbaugh sat out a three-game suspension in connection with the scandal.\n\nThe Wolverines went 8-5 during Moore\u2019s first year at the helm\u2014a year highlighted by a thrilling victory over Ohio State in Columbus and a bowl victory over Alabama.\n\nMichigan went 9-3 in Moore\u2019s first full year as head coach. He served a two-game suspension in 2025 for his part in the sign-stealing scandal.\n\nThe Wolverines did not make the College Football Playoff in either of Moore\u2019s two seasons as head coach.",

It is here, and it is seriously impacting the health of workers in Massachusetts,\" Emily H. Sparer-Fine, a director at DPH, said in a statement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/health/michigan-man-dies-rabies-after-receiving-kidney-from-infected-donor-who-saved-kitten-from-skunk-cdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>MICHIGAN MAN DIES OF RABIES AFTER RECEIVING KIDNEY FROM INFECTED DONOR WHO SAVED KITTEN FROM SKUNK: CDC</strong></a></p><p>The unnamed patient reportedly performed activities such as cutting, grinding and polishing, which can generate crystalline silica dust. When inhaled, this dust scars lung tissue and can <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead to silicosis</a>, DPH said.</p><p>The disease is preventable but irreversible and progressive, officials said. Symptoms include a persistent cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. Because there is often a long latency period between exposure and symptom onset, diagnoses are frequently delayed, according to DPH.\u00a0</p><p>As the disease progresses, it can result in serious complications, including lung cancer, tuberculosis and even death, the department added.\u00a0</p><p>Officials added that \"most cases of silicosis are work-related \u2013 it is very rare for silicosis to occur outside of workplace exposure.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cdc-reports-19th-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak-year-affecting-passengers-crew\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CDC REPORTS 19TH CRUISE SHIP NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK THIS YEAR AFFECTING PASSENGERS AND CREW</u></strong></a></p><p>Officials said the risk exists when handling natural stones, such as granite, but is especially high when working with engineered stone, such as quartz. While natural granite typically contains less than 45% silica, engineered stone can contain more than 90%, DPH reported.</p><p>\"In recent years, the disease has become more prevalent among stone fabrication workers due to the rise in popularity of countertops made from engineered stone (also known as quartz or artificial stone),\" DPH reported.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/botulism-deaths-raise-food-truck-safety-concerns-doctor-preaches-awareness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>BOTULISM DEATHS RAISE FOOD TRUCK SAFETY CONCERNS AS DOCTOR PREACHES 'AWARENESS'</u></strong></a></p><p>The department noted that, while this is the first confirmed case in Massachusetts within this industry, more cases are expected due to the disease's long latency period and the rising popularity of engineered stone.</p><p>Other states have also reported cases of silicosis. In a 2023 study, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">California researchers</a> identified 52 quartz countertop workers with silicosis. Twenty of them had advanced disease and 10 died.</p><p>Despite the disease\u2019s potential severity, there has not been an outright ban on <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/regulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quartz in U.S. kitchens</a>. By contrast, all work involving engineered stone has already been banned in Australia due to the severe risks it poses to workers. Other countries are also pushing for more regulations.</p><p>The DPH emphasizes that silicosis is \"absolutely preventable\" through proper workplace controls. The alert urges employers in the stone countertop fabrication industry to implement effective safety measures, such as wet cutting and proper ventilation, to minimize silica exposure and protect workers.</p><p>\"Silicosis is a devastating, life-altering disease and one that is also absolutely preventable,\" Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in a statement.</p>",

He appeared in 16 games that year in what, until recently, marked his lone season with the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/indianapolis-colts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Indianapolis Colts.</a></p><p>Fast-forward five years, as a season-ending injury to Colts starter Daniel Jones prompted Rivers\u2019 former team to give him a call about the possibility of putting his retirement on pause.

I kind of thought that ship had sailed,\" said Rivers, who played 16 seasons for the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers before joining the Colts in 2020, and again, this week.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>\"But something about it excited me.

I know there\u2019s risk involved, but the only way to find out is going for it.\"</p><p>Rivers added that he happened to be watching the Colts game at the moment Jones fell to the turf. He admitted that it crossed his mind that he might eventually receive a call from Indianapolis coach Shane Steichen.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/colts-daniel-jones-slams-helmet-frustration-he-suffers-gruesome-achilles-injury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>COLTS' DANIEL JONES SLAMS HELMET IN FRUSTRATION AS HE SUFFERS GRUESOME ACHILLES INJURY</strong></a></p><p>\"When that happened, in my mind, I was like, \u2018What in the world?\u2019 Just how crazy this would be on the quarterback position, I have to admit I thought,'I wonder if Shane will call,\u2019\" Rivers said. \"Immediately, the competitor in you gets excited.\"</p><p>Rivers, an eight-time Pro-Bowler, has long worn the No. 17, and will continue to do so in his second stint with the Colts, courtesy of Jones.</p><p>\"I saw the injury live. I feel terrible for Daniel,\" Rivers said. \"I texted with Daniel about him being so gracious about 17. That was meaningful to me.\"</p><p>The Colts\u2019 injury crisis was compounded by the uncertainty about quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr.\u2019s health.\u00a0</p><p>Richardson, the fourth overall selection in the 2023 NFL Draft, was placed on injured reserve in October after he suffered an orbital fracture during a pregame warm-up.</p><p>The Colts visit the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/seattle-seahawks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seattle Seahawks</a> this Sunday in Week 15 action.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s</strong></i><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> sports coverage on X</a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

Discovery.</p><p>Neither Warner Bros. Discovery nor Netflix responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. A spokesperson for CNN declined to comment.</p><p>In October, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was putting itself up for sale. It previously said it was going to split into two companies \u2014 one for the studio and HBO, the other being the cable networks within the corporate umbrella.</p><p>Before Netflix emerged last week as the victor of the bidding war, it had seemed that Paramount owner David Ellison was in the driver's seat, only to be off-roaded by the streaming giant on Friday with its nearly $83 billion offer. On Monday, Paramount launched a $108 billion hostile takeover bid for the entire company, including its cable assets like CNN.</p><p>Trump's comments will likely loom over the bidding war because his administration could be a hurdle for both Netflix and Paramount to buy Warner Bros.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/trump-warns-netflix-warner-bros-discovery-deal-could-problem-says-hell-involved-decision\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>TRUMP WARNS NETFLIX-WARNER BROS DISCOVERY DEAL COULD BE A PROBLEM, SAYS HE'LL BE \u2018INVOLVED\u2019 IN DECISION</u></strong></a></p><p>CNN staffers are largely feeling \"grim\" about the prospects of CNN being owned by Ellison, who Trump has a cozy relationship with.</p><p>Network insiders say that their colleagues worry Ellison would overhaul CNN's editorial decisions the way he has with CBS News with his appointment of Bari Weiss as its editor-in-chief.</p><p>\"They see CBS as a complete and utter s--- show, which it was before this to be honest,\" one CNN staffer told <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fox News Digital</a>, conceding \"our organization is also in chaos and crisis.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/senate-gears-up-intense-antitrust-hearing-wake-netflix-warner-bros-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>SENATE GEARS UP FOR 'INTENSE' ANTITRUST HEARING IN WAKE OF NETFLIX, WARNER BROS DEAL</u></strong></a></p><p>In August, Ellison took over Paramount as part of its $8 billion merger with Skydance Media. The deal was plagued by politics as Paramount settled Trump's election interference lawsuit against the company over CBS News' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>Kamala Harris</u></a>.\u00a0</p><p>Liberal critics accused Paramount of \"bending the knee\" to Trump in order for his FCC to approve the merger. They also expressed outrage over <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-cancels-the-late-show-stephen-colbert-end-program-may-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>CBS' cancellation</u></a> of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" which will stop airing after May 2026. The network insisted it was purely a financial decision, though critics believe it was also tied to the FCC-approved merger.\u00a0</p><p>During a CNBC interview Monday, Ellison was asked whether he would combine CNN and CBS News' newsgathering operations. He dodged the question, speaking instead about the broader goal he has for news, which is getting into the \"trust\" and \"truth business\" that \"speaks to the 70% of Americans in the middle,\" a sentiment previously echoed by Weiss.</p><p>However, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-netflix-warner-bros-battle-ellisons-a86fe15c?st=6zkB6m&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>reported</u></a> that Ellison had told Trump officials that he'd make sweeping changes to CNN if he became its owner and that Trump has been vocal about wanting CNN to have new ownership that will make programming changes.</p><p>\"I think everyone wants to be fair,\" a second CNN staffer said. \"I don't think [CNN colleagues] see Ellison as trying to target the political middle. I think they think he is kowtowing to Trump.\"</p><p>Trump has so far had a more agnostic approach to the bidding war despite his close relationship with Ellison, and his father, billionaire Larry Ellison. Last week, Trump praised Netflix as a \"great company\" and called its CEO, Ted Sarandos, a \"fantastic man\" but expressed concern about its market share.\u00a0</p><p>On Monday, he refrained from saying he supported Paramount's bid despite it being partially financed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner's private equity firm, Affinity Partners, something Trump told reporters he hadn't discussed with Kushner.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-unloads-cbs-60-minutes-over-marjorie-taylor-greenes-interview-demands-apology-rips-ownership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>blasted Paramount</u></a> over the \"60 Minutes\" interview featuring ally-turned-foe Rep.

Alonso is reportedly headed to the Baltimore Orioles, while Diaz will be joining the back-to-back reigning champion Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><p>It\u2019s a hard reality for Mets fans to accept, especially after Steve Cohen, by far the richest owner in the sport and a lifelong Mets fan, took control of the team five years ago. Yet the front office decided to let a homegrown talent and another fan favorite walk.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a><i><strong>\u00a0</strong></i></p><p>That prompted longtime New York radio host Joe Beningo to <a href=\"https://www.audacy.com/stations/wfan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">call into his old station</a>, WFAN, to rip ownership and president of baseball operations David Stearns.</p><p>\"You know I can't stand David Stearns. He thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. We're gonna find out now how freaking smart David Stearns is. We're gonna find out how brilliant that Harvard education serves David Stearns. We'll see.\u00a0</p><p>\"But the guy that's the real culprit is the owner. The owner sold us a bill of goods. We all thought, we were all sucked in, 'Uncle Stevie's big money, it's never going to be the same like it was with the Wilpons,' and he spent money. [Justin] Verlander, [Max] Scherzer, he went on and got [Juan] Soto. But where is this guy? He's supposed to be like Mr. Met, I gotta see him courtside at the Garden at the playoff games with the Met hat on. What kind of Met fan are you? You telling me you're a Met fan, Cohen? Forget about Stearns, he's a fraud as far as a Met fan. He's probably got Yankee gear at home.\"</p><p>Beningo also compared Alonso\u2019s departure to Tom Seaver being traded and Darryl Strawberry signing with the Dodgers before making a bold proclamation about the team\u2019s former owners, who were notorious for being cheap.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/orioles-sign-star-slugger-record-contract-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ORIOLES SIGN STAR SLUGGER TO RECORD CONTRACT: REPORTS</strong></a></p><p>\"We all knew what the Wilpons were\u2026 but you know what? I really believe Fred Wilpon, Jeff Wilpon would have recognized what Alonso specifically meant to the organization, and they would have signed him. I really believe that,\" Beningo said, citing that the Wilpons extended David Wright to make him a lifelong Met. \"As much as we get on the Wilpons, and this guy is nowhere to be found. He sold us a bill of goods. I don't care what they do, I don't care what the little genius does now the rest of the way\u2026 it doesn't make up for this, and it doesn't make us a better team than the Dodgers.\"</p><p>\"The owner, I'm p----d at the owner,\" he added. \"I can't tell you how ticked off I am\u2026 He sold us a bill of goods and stuck it right up our rear end.\"</p><p>Earlier this offseason, the Mets also <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mets-rangers-agree-swap-all-stars-brandon-nimmo-marcus-semien-blockbuster-deal-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">traded Brandon Nimmo</a>, another homegrown talent, to the Texas Rangers for Marcus Semien. They also signed Devin Williams, who had a tumultuous season with the New York Yankees, to a three-year deal.</p><p>The offseason has plenty of time left, and players such as Kyle Tucker, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cody-bellinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cody Bellinger</a>, Bo Bichette and Framber Valdez remain available. But for now, Cohen and Stearns are public enemy No. 1 in Queens \u2014 just one year after being hailed as heroes for swiping Soto from the Bronx.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s\u00a0</strong></i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>,\u00a0and subscribe to\u00a0</strong></i><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

Conservatives in particular have panned the enhanced subsidies as a COVID-19-era relic that benefited insurance companies rather than Americans.</p><p>But some GOP lawmakers have joined Democrats in warning that failing to extend them at least temporarily at this point will result in millions of Americans seeing their <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-faces-holiday-crunch-health-care-fix-collides-shrinking-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">healthcare premiums skyrocket</a> while Congress refuses to act.</p><p>Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa., another Republican who signed the petition, said House GOP leaders signaled they would be \"putting forward\" a number of healthcare reforms \"that are very positive in nature,\" but \"an extension of the ACA tax credits was not included in that package.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/scalise-announces-gop-healthcare-overhaul-coming-next-few-weeks-amid-battle-over-expiring-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SCALISE ANNOUNCES GOP HEALTHCARE OVERHAUL COMING IN 'NEXT FEW WEEKS' AMID BATTLE OVER EXPIRING SUBSIDIES</strong></a></p><p>\"So, we have been talking about and advocating for that to move forward, and so this seems like the best vehicle to do that,\" Mackenzie said.\u00a0</p><p>He told Fox News Digital, \"The reason we're in this mess to begin with is that things were done in a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partisan fashion</a>. And, so, I think if we want longevity and reforms and changes, we should be doing it in a bipartisan fashion.</p><p>\"It's a time-sensitive matter, and it's an existential matter for people back home who we care about where this is a very real problem,\" Fitzpatrick told reporters. \"You try to do things through the normal course, you try to do things through regular order. When all those remedies are exhausted, then you've got to go this route, unfortunately.\"</p><p>Asked if it was spurred at all by moderates' conversation on the House floor with Johnson, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said, \"It was clear that, given the timeframe and given some of the differences within our conference on particular issues, that a bill was not going to be put forward. And so I think we all recognize the importance of getting an extension passed.\"</p><p>But it's not clear whether <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/democrats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">House Democratic leaders</a>, who have their own discharge petition for a three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies, will support the bill. It likely will not succeed without buy-in from all House Democrats.</p><p>Asked if his leaders would back it, Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, said, \"Go ask them. But I think they ought to.\"</p><p>Johnson, for his part, told reporters discharge petitions were \"typically used as a tool against the majority\" but said he was \"very sympathetic\" to moderate Republicans' concerns.</p><p>\"We have spent many, many hours trying to find a way out of the conundrum that we're in. With regard to those extensions, there's a lot of people who are very concerned about Obamacare and the fact that the subsidies were created by Democrats for COVID-era limited use,\" Johnson said.</p><p>\"We just can't get Republican votes on that for lots of reasons, not enough of them. And, so, look, my colleagues have made a decision. I don't take it against them personally, I don't operate that way. I have great respect for those guys, I understand the situation they're in for their districts, and we'll see how it plays out.\"</p>",

A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people,\u201d the president later posted on his Truth Social, sharing a link to the website for applicants.\n\n\u201cSO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!\u201d\n\nThe card purchases are revamping the backlogged and cumbersome EB-5 visa program that had awarded permanent legal status to foreigners who invest up to $1 million in US businesses.\n\nAs many as 250,000 foreigners were still waiting for their approvals as part of that program as of February this year.\n\nCongress authorized the visa program in 1990 to place investments of differing levels based on the region of the US. Some rural areas only required around $800,000 as opposed to $1 million.\n\nThe foreign investors also had to show they could create at least 10 American jobs with the funds.\n\nJust 135,518 EB-5 visas have been issued in its 25-year history, according to data from the Invest In the USA (IIUSA) trade association.\n\nPresident Donald Trump displays a signed executive order on gold card visa in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, September 19, 2025. REUTERS\n\nTrump expects that \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in revenue could result \u2014 and that top business leaders like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook have celebrated the gold card solution.\n\nOriginally set at a a $5 million price tag, the card has also been touted by Trump and his officials as a way of balancing the federal budget with more revenue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a line for EB-5 of 250,000 right now. 200,000 of these gold green cards [at $5 million] is $1 trillion to pay down our debt,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in February.\n\nThe nation\u2019s debt currently stands at more than $38 trillion.",

    "content": "*Set in an unnamed state in 2008, an idealistic 34-year-old lieutenant governor juggles familial issues and a challenging work life while preparing to take over the job of her mentor, the state's longtime incumbent governor, who suddenly accepts a cabinet position in the incoming Obama administration.*\n\nCast: Emma Mackey, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jack Lowden, Woody Harrelson, Rebecca Hall\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 21%\n\nMetacritic: 41\n\nSome reviews:\n\nJocelyn Noveck, Associated Press 1/4 - It\u2019s hard to understand how \u201cElla McCay,\u201d the first original feature from writer-director Brooks in 15 years, goes so utterly haywire. Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\u201d? \u201cTerms of Endearment\u201d? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d?\n\nJohnny Oleksinski, New York Post 1/4 - This sloppy slog is terrible; short, but interminable.\n\nMoira MacDonald, Seattle Times 2.5/4 - It\u2019s not at all unpleasant spending two hours with Ella and her family and colleagues, but it leaves you feeling a little nostalgic for what it could have been.\n\nRadheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail - Ella McCay, the movie, feels like we\u2019re being bear hugged by a lovable, slightly boozy old grand-uncle who genuinely hopes to find common ground with a new generation, but also can\u2019t help being a little patronizing.\n\nNick Schager, The Daily Beast - Its phoniness epitomized by Emma Mackey\u2019s lead turn, it\u2019s the biggest dud of the artist\u2019s career, and the holiday season\u2019s most egregious misfire.\n\nOdie Henderson, Boston Globe 2/4 - Ella McCay never registers as a real person; she\u2019s a collection of tics that Mackey desperately tries to play.\n\nVikram Murthi, IndieWire B - Watching \u201cElla McCay\u201d can sometimes feel like time travel, particularly for those vested in bygone eras of American filmmaking, but if you\u2019re capable of tuning into its wavelength, an old but worthwhile spirit can be found.\n\nTim Robey, Daily Telegraph (UK) 1/5 - There\u2019s not a great deal more to be said about the experience, except that it is best politely avoided, like a Christmas invitation from neighbours you find chirpy, well-meaning and off-puttingly strange on every collision.\n\nTara Brady, Irish Times 3/5 - At 85, Brooks retains an instinct for human foibles and complex characters, even if on this occasion the material doesn\u2019t always live up to his cast.\n\nTim Grierson, Screen International - This comedy-drama contains some of the crackling dialogue and disarming candour of Brooks\u2019 best work. Ultimately, however, this disjointed character study ultimately feels as messy as its heroine\u2019s life.\n\nAdrian Horton, Guardian 2/5 - Ella McCay is, first and foremost, a mess -- a clunky collection of incoherent characters and confounding plot that seem to defy basic story logic at every turn, and not in a surprising or intriguing way.\n\nWilliam Bibbiani, TheWrap - 'Ella McCay' is a film about American politics in the same way that Pixar\u2019s 'Cars' is a movie about cars. As in yes, these are definitely films about politics and cars. But no, politics and cars don't work like that.\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter - Almost everyone here is trying way too hard, with the exception of Mackey, who\u2019s appealing and natural even when stuck in a phony world full of phony characters.\n\nTaylor Williams, Slant Magazine 2/4 - As it follows its main character navigating political and personal waters, James L. Brook\u2019s film finds itself poised between sincerity and artificiality\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes page:\nhttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ella_mccay\n\nMetacritic page:\nhttps://www.metacritic.com/movie/ella-mccay/",

He\u2019s missed significant time due to injuries in 3/6 seasons. Speaking from personal experience, it\u2019s hard to want to keep doing a sport when you\u2019ve had so much pain caused by it. He may just be done with the injuries and rehab.",

I think all the internet BS and misinformation is more harmful to society when adults (like those who vote..!) get sucked in.   Maybe instead of banning, we turn off the share button and commenting?  So the internet is more about media than socializing?",
      "u/threeoldbeigecamaros: There must be a lot of lobbying dollars behind this to be bi-partisan.  So that means the social media companies are engaging in regulatory capture to cut off future competitors by denying them access to the users that made them dominate industry",
      "u/RoyalCities: These laws are such BS. If social media is so toxic it makes more sense to regulate large social media companies rather than banning kids by way of having every Adult send their ID to random companies to use the internet.\n\nFirst they could start by open sourcing the recommendation systems for public scrutiny if / when a social media platform gets very large and has millions of users. \n\nBasically all recommendation systems are just built around cosine similarity and Twitter has shown there is massive power in that tech.\n\nSo start off with real public oversight just so they KNOW how the levers are being skewed when they use it. Heck there is oversight in the food and drug markets since it directly deals with what people are putting in their body - I'd argue the fact a company can en-mass dictate what they can put in your mind warrants the same level of scrutiny. \n\nIf social media became so toxic and polarizing then maybe start by investigating HOW it got so bad - rather than just trying to gatekeep access to it because then you haven't really fixed the problem at all.",

Weiss is already making talent changes. She recently snatched Matt Gutman from ABC News, and promoted King\u2019s colleague Tony Dokoupil to anchor of \u201cCBS Evening News.\u201d\n\n6 The New York Post exclusively reported Tony Dokoupil was being promoted to anchor of \u201cCBS Evening News.\u201d CBS via Getty Images\n\n6 CBS boss Bari Weiss recently hired Matt Gutman from ABC News.

Slaughter</i></a>, a case in which it is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/08/us/trump-supreme-court-presidential-power\">likely</a> to overturn <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/03/19/trump-fires-democratic-ftc-commissioners/\"><i>Humphrey's Executor</i></a>, a decision that would likely grant the president license not only to remove executive agency bureaucrats but to replace the Fed's Board of Governors. In view of these pressures, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), led by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, may be preemptively catering to President Donald Trump's calls to lower interest rates in a bid to avoid replacement if and when <i>Humphrey's Executor</i> is overturned.</p>\n<p>Trump has been egging the FOMC, the Fed's key policymaking body, to lower rates since this summer. In June, the president sent Powell a letter <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/07/30/the-federal-reserve-rightly-rejects-trumps-calls-for-lower-interest-rates/\">saying</a>, \"we should be paying 1% Interest, or better!\" In late July, with year-over-year inflation <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-inflation-pce.htm\">at 2.6 percent</a>, well above the Fed's 2 percent target, Powell and all but two members of <a href=\"http://two\">the 12-member FOMC</a> wisely <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/07/30/the-federal-reserve-rightly-rejects-trumps-calls-for-lower-interest-rates/\">held</a> the fed funds target constant. However, in mid-September, the Fed <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/18/the-federal-reserve-cuts-rates-with-inflation-still-hot-is-political-pressure-winning/\">decreased</a> the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, lowering <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU\">the upper bound</a> rate from 4.5 percent to 4.25 percent.</p>\n<p>Stephen Miran, nominated by Trump and confirmed as a member of the Fed's Board of Governors in September, shortly before the fed funds announcement, <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/18/the-federal-reserve-cuts-rates-with-inflation-still-hot-is-political-pressure-winning/\">dissented</a>. Per the FOMC's <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250917a.htm\">official statement</a>, Miran \"preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point.\"</p>\n<p>At the end of October, the FOMC lowered the fed funds rate by another 25 basis points, leaving the upper bound at 4.0 percent. Miran again <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\">dissented</a>, preferring a 50 basis point decrease in the federal funds rate. Miran's dissent was juxtaposed by Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who voted against lowering the rate at all.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Miran yet again objected to the FOMC's decision to lower the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, preferring a 50-basis point drop. Schmid also dissented the same way he had in October, voting for no change whatsoever. On Wednesday, Schmid was joined in his opposition to rate cuts by Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\u00a0<em>The Wall Street Journal\u00a0</em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-cuts-rates-again-signals-it-may-be-done-for-now-67069bb5?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf2esxoM9yqmlinffEI--KMYinbGLTUwuUKMIlofYCNiBsGnUx01uXcCUxIxZ4%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6939f37e&amp;gaa_sig=8V0puUDf4PCbW0z0kz0edLV08TLyE51-6wkTVYjCeghSm0uEI1QDerdKxKl1Eah-10vj5j1j3igelX0P_tC3wQ%3D%3D\">notes</a> that this is \"the first time in six years that three officials cast dissents.\"</p>\n<p>But two members of the FOMC voting against further rate cuts should not be surprising: Year-over-year inflation has been stubbornly increasing since April. The Consumer Price Index, the most common inflation metric and the one used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm\">rose</a> from 2.3 percent in April to 3 percent in September. Meanwhile, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-inflation-pce.htm\">increased</a> from 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent. At the same time, the unemployment rate has <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm\">increased</a> from 4.2 percent to 4.4 percent, while the labor force participation rate <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm\">decreased slightly</a> from 62.6 percent to 62.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Peter C. Earle, director of economics and economic freedom at the American Institute for Economic Research, tells <i>Reason</i> that the Fed's decision to continue lowering interest rates in the face of persistently elevated inflation signals that \"it has chosen to prioritize labor market softness over the purchasing power of the dollar and broader affordability concerns.\" Earle says the latest cut is risky, but defensible, as \"inflation projections for this year and 2026 have been revised lower, [while] unemployment forecasts remain steady, and private hiring data suggest a labor market that's cooling.\" More troubling than the decision itself is the phenomenon of \"members aligning their votes with rapid, deeper cuts in line with what the President has expressed a desire for.\"</p>\n<p>Earle predicts that, \"if presidential discretion over the Fed's Board of Governors expands in the wake of <i>Humphrey's Executor </i>[being overturned]&hellip;the result would be a Federal Reserve more vulnerable to serving the immediate priorities of the executive branch rather than maintaining consistent rules, stable money, and a predictable policy environment.\" Such central bank would \"weaken the dollar and undermine long-term investment planning,\" warns Earle.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/federal-reserve-defers-to-donald-trump-by-cutting-interest-rates-by-25-points/\">Federal Reserve Defers to Donald Trump by Cutting Interest Rates by 25 Points</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

Import taxes on machinery and fertilizer are raising farmers' costs. Foreign countries' retaliatory tariffs are closing off export markets.</p>\n<p>The contradictions of the Trump administration's agriculture bailout, however, go beyond using tariff revenue to ameliorate the costs of tariffs.</p>\n<p>Among those eligible for the <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/12/08/trump-administration-announces-12-billion-farmer-bridge-payments-american-farmers-impacted-unfair\">new bailout will be</a> growers of corn, sunflower, canola, rapeseed, and safflower\u2014that is to say, growers of the most common seeds used for seed oils.</p>\n<p>So, on the one hand, the Trump administration is encouraging Americans to consume fewer seed oils through policy nudges and the government's bully pulpit. On the other hand, it's bailing out the producers of the products that it wants Americans to consume less of.</p>\n<p>A more consistent policy would involve either welcoming the collapsing fortunes of seed growers or, alternatively, encouraging Americans to consume more seed oils to prop up the suffering industry.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Trump administration has settled on a contradictory effort to encourage seed oil production while suppressing seed oil consumption.</p>\n<p>Federal agriculture policy has long been a contradictory mix of hectoring nanny state restrictions on things you're not supposed to eat and subsidies for the producers of those same discouraged products.</p>\n<p>The MAHA movement was supposed to be a more significant break with past federal nutrition policy. Instead, it's found itself in the same contradictory position.</p>\n<p>The list of discouraged ingredients is a little heavier on seed oils and a little lighter on trans fats, but little else has changed about the government's crony relationship with the food industry.</p>\n<p>Consumers should take note. The federal government will always be more invested in keeping agricultural subsidies flowing than in improving the diets of the average American.</p>\n<p>Healthier consumption behaviors are ultimately going to come from better personal decisions, not policy nudges from Washington.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/the-maha-administration-bails-out-big-seed-oil/\">The MAHA Administration Bails Out Big Seed Oil</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

On its face, that move is a <a href=\"https://www.firearmspolicy.org/trump-admin-enacts-fpc-proposal-to-create-new-doj-second-amendment-rights-section\">welcome development</a> for defenders of the constitutional right to armed self-defense\u2014an impression reinforced by the <a href=\"https://www.bradyunited.org/press/doj-launch-of-new-gun-rights-office-second-amendment-civil-rights-division\">alarm</a> the new initiative has generated among gun control advocates. But the section's mission statement raises doubts about its commitment to Second Amendment advocacy. So does the Justice Department's (DOJ) ongoing defense of constitutionally dubious federal gun laws.</p>\n<p>\"I'm really excited about this,\" Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Civil Rights Division, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-promises-a-lot-more-action-gun-rights-new-second-amendment-enforcement-section\">told</a> Fox News. \"For the first time, the DOJ Civil Rights Division and the DOJ at large will be protecting and advancing our citizens' right to bear arms as part of our civil rights work&hellip;.As Attorney General Pam Bondi has said, the Second Amendment is not a second-class right, and I couldn't agree more with my boss.\"</p>\n<p>Dhillon said the Justice Department will challenge obstacles to obtaining concealed carry permits such as \"multi-thousand-dollar costs\" and \"unreasonably long delays.\" Another potential target, she said, is state bans on \"guns that should be protected by the Second Amendment\" under \"recent Supreme Court precedent,\" by which she presumably meant <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/05/14/assault-weapons-explained/\">\"assault weapon\" bans</a>. In a recent Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1259/379286/20251009151027698_24-1259RushOpp.pdf\">brief</a>, the government's lawyers suggested that \"cases involving state laws banning AR-15 rifles\" provide good \"vehicles for clarifying the appropriate framework for discerning what types of arms the Second Amendment protects.\"</p>\n<p>So far, so good. But the Justice Department's description of the Second Amendment Section's agenda should give pause to anyone familiar with the litigation inspired by the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf\"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a>, which clarified the Second Amendment test for gun control laws and cast doubt on the constitutionality of many longstanding firearm restrictions.</p>\n<p>The Second Amendment Section aims to protect \"the natural firearm rights of law-abiding American citizens and ensure that such rights to keep and bear arms will not be infringed,\" the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/crt/second-amendment-section\">says</a>. \"The mission of the 2nd Amendment Section is to ensure that law-abiding American citizens may responsibly possess, carry, and use firearms.\"</p>\n<p>That \"law-abiding\" qualifier does not appear in the text of the Second Amendment. Nor is it \"consistent with this Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation\"\u2014the constitutional test established by <em>Bruen</em>. And taken literally, it excludes millions of peaceful Americans from exercising \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\"</p>\n<p>In the landmark Second Amendment case\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-290P.ZO\"><em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em></a>, the Supreme Court did refer to \"law-abiding citizens.\" It said the amendment \"does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.\" And it upheld \"the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" But the Court also recognized that the phrase \"the people,\" which appears in the First, Fourth, Ninth, and 10th amendments as well as the Second, \"unambiguously refers to all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset.\" According to <em>Heller</em>, that language creates a \"strong presumption\" that the right to arms \"belongs to all Americans.\"</p>\n<p>In the 2023 case\u00a0<a href=\"https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/212835pen.pdf\"><em>Range v. Attorney General</em></a>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit unambiguously <a href=\"https://reason.com/2023/06/07/disarming-a-man-based-on-a-nonviolent-misdemeanor-is-unconstitutional-the-3rd-circuit-rules/\">rejected</a> the proposition that the Second Amendment applies only to \"law-abiding\" citizens. \"We are confident that the Supreme Court's references to 'law-abiding, responsible citizens' do not mean that every American who gets a traffic ticket is no longer among 'the people' protected by the Second Amendment,\" Judge Thomas M. Hardiman wrote in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p>What about more serious offenses, such as felonies? The problem with that reading, Hardiman said, is that it empowers the government to strip individuals of their constitutional rights based on how legislators decide to classify an offense. \"At root, the Government's claim that only 'law-abiding, responsible citizens' are protected by the Second Amendment devolves authority to legislators to decide whom to exclude from 'the people,'\" Hardiman noted. \"We reject that approach because such 'extreme deference gives legislatures unreviewable power to manipulate the Second Amendment by choosing a label.'\"</p>\n<p>The law at issue in that case was <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922\">18 USC 922(g)(1)</a>, which makes it a felony for anyone convicted of \"a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" to receive or possess a firearm. That provision, the 3rd Circuit ruled, was unconstitutional as applied to Bryan Range, a Pennsylvania man who lost his gun rights because he had pleaded guilty nearly three decades earlier to fraudulently obtaining $2,458 in food stamps by understating his income.</p>\n<p>Range's offense was a misdemeanor under Pennsylvania law, and his sentence was limited to restitution, a $100 fine, $288 in court costs, and three years of probation. But because his crime was notionally punishable by up to five years in prison, his conviction triggered Section 922(g)(1), which encompasses state misdemeanors punishable by more than two years of incarceration.</p>\n<p>\"The Government has not shown that the Nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation supports depriving Range of his Second Amendment right to possess a firearm,\" Hardiman wrote. \"Because the Government has not shown that our Republic has a longstanding history and tradition of depriving people like Range of their firearms, [it] cannot constitutionally strip him of his Second Amendment rights.\"</p>\n<p>As I explain in my new book <a href=\"https://beyondcontrolbook.net/\"><em>Beyond Control</em></a>, the law that deprived Range of his gun rights covers an absurdly broad spectrum of offenses, disarming millions of people with no history of violence. It does not matter what the offense entailed, how long ago it was committed, or what sentence was actually imposed. Section 922(g)(1) empowers Congress and state legislators to restrict the Second Amendment simply by authorizing maximum sentences that meet the provision's criteria, even if those penalties are rarely or never imposed in practice.</p>\n<p>Since <em>Bruen</em>, at least seven federal appeals courts have <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/10/will-scotus-resolve-the-circuit-split-on-a-law-that-disarms-people-based-on-nonviolent-crimes/\">ruled</a> that Section 922(g)(1) is constitutional in all of its applications. But at least three\u2014the <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/23-50452/23-50452-2024-09-18.pdf\">5th</a>, <a href=\"https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/24a0195p-06.pdf\">6th</a>, and <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/22-1557/22-1557-2023-06-20.pdf\">7th</a> circuits\u2014have joined the 3rd Circuit in holding that Section 922(g)(1) may be unconstitutional as applied to people with nonviolent criminal records.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department repeatedly defended that law against such challenges during the Biden administration. It continues to do so under the Trump administration, notwithstanding the president's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/protecting-second-amendment-rights/\">avowed commitment</a> to the Second Amendment and his <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/01/15/the-law-that-disarmed-trump-is-unfair-illogical-and-constitutionally-dubious/\">personal experience</a> with this law, which bars him from possessing firearms because he was <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/05/30/the-verdict-against-trump-suggests-jurors-bought-the-prosecutions-dubious-election-fraud-narrative/\">convicted</a> of state felonies involving falsification of business records.</p>\n<p>Consider the government's response to a Supreme Court petition from Melynda Vincent, a Utah social worker who is <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/06/12/17-years-ago-she-lost-her-gun-rights-for-passing-a-bad-check-she-wants-scotus-to-rectify-that-injustice/\">barred</a> from possessing firearms under Section 922(g)(1) because she was convicted of passing a bad check at a grocery store 17 years ago. Vincent is <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1155/358365/20250508130618964_Vincent%20Cert%20Petition%20-%20FINAL.pdf\">asking</a> the Court to resolve the circuit split on this issue, arguing that the law is unconstitutional as applied to her because \"our historical tradition of firearms regulation does not permit the federal government to permanently disarm someone based solely on the fact of a prior nonviolent criminal conviction.\" That is especially true, her lawyers say, when \"no evidence suggests that the person poses, or has ever posed, a threat to anyone else.\"</p>\n<p>In opposition to Vincent's petition, Solicitor General D. John Sauer <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1155/369383/20250811150023889_24-1155VincentOpp.pdf\">argues</a> that she \"cannot prevail on her Second Amendment challenge\" because the Justice Department has <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/06/27/criminal-justice-reformers-should-welcome-pam-bondis-gun-rights-restoration-initiative/\">revived</a> a previously moribund process for restoring the gun rights of people whom the attorney general determines are not \"likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety.\" But that process is entirely discretionary. If disarming someone like Vincent fails the\u00a0<em>Bruen</em> test, it is no answer to say she can beg for the restoration of constitutional rights she should not have lost to begin with.</p>\n<p>\"At least as a general matter,\" Sauer says, \"Section 922(g)(1)'s disarmament of convicted felons complies with the Second Amendment.\" In\u00a0<em>Heller</em>, he notes, the Supreme Court described \"longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons\" as \"presumptively lawful,\" and it quoted that language in subsequent decisions. But none of those cases directly addressed Section 922(g)(1), and describing certain restrictions as \"presumptively lawful\" suggests that presumption might be overcome in some circumstances. The Court in <em>Heller\u00a0</em>explicitly did not delve into the reasoning for that label, saying \"there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us.\"</p>\n<p>Sauer also trots out the familiar argument that \"death was 'the standard penalty for all serious crimes' at the founding,\" which he thinks means the lesser penalty of losing one's gun rights must be constitutional. But as Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted in a 2019 <a href=\"https://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2019/D03-15/C:18-1478:J:Barrett:dis:T:fnOp:N:2309276:S:0#page=27\">dissent</a> as an appeals court judge, \"the obvious point that the dead enjoy no rights does not tell us what the founding-era generation would have understood about the rights of felons who lived, discharged their sentences, and returned to society.\"</p>\n<p>It surely would be odd to argue, based on that \"obvious point,\" that people with felony records should automatically lose, say, the right to freedom of speech or the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Although Dhillon declares that \"the Second Amendment is not a second-class right,\" the government's position in this case seems to treat it that way.</p>\n<p>That position puts the Trump administration at odds with the National Rifle Association (NRA), the Firearms Policy Coalition, and the Second Amendment Foundation. Under <em>Bruen</em>, those groups argue in a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1155/362890/20250611142353837_24-1155%20-%20NRA%20-%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf\">brief</a> supporting Vincent's petition, \"all firearm regulations must be justified by historical tradition, including the regulations that <em>Heller</em> labeled 'presumptively lawful.'\"</p>\n<p>Delving into the historical evidence, the NRA et al. conclude that \"there is no tradition of disarming peaceable citizens.\" Historically, they say, \"nonviolent criminals\u2014including nonviolent felons\u2014who did not demonstrate a propensity for violence retained the ability to exercise their right to keep and bear arms.\" In fact, \"some laws expressly allowed or even required them to keep and bear arms\" for militia service.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration's position in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-1234.html\"><em>United States v. Hemani</em></a> further illustrates its determination to restrict Second Amendment rights. That case, which the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/20/scotus-will-consider-the-constitutionality-of-the-federal-ban-on-gun-possession-by-illegal-drug-users/\">will hear</a> this term, involves 18 USC 922(g)(3), which <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/07/21/hunter-biden-walks-free-while-this-iowa-man-serves-4-years-for-the-same-crime/\">prohibits</a> gun possession by any \"unlawful user\" of a \"controlled substance.\" Like Section 922(g)(1), that provision disarms millions of Americans who pose no plausible threat to public safety, including cannabis consumers who live in states that have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. And as with Section 922(g)(1), the Trump administration <a href=\"https://reason.com/2024/03/20/biden-decries-criminalization-of-cannabis-consumers-even-as-he-insists-they-have-no-second-amendment-rights/\">echoes</a> the Biden administration in <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/10/29/trump-an-avowed-second-amendment-champion-defends-a-gun-ban-with-no-historical-justification/\">arguing</a> that the law is perfectly constitutional.</p>\n<p>In the 2024 case\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-50312-CR0.pdf\"><em>United States v. Connelly</em></a>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found \"no historical justification for disarming a sober citizen not presently under an impairing influence.\" This year in <a href=\"https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/25/02/241998P.pdf\"><em>United States v. Cooper</em></a>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit agreed that specific prosecutions under Section 922(g)(3) may violate the Second Amendment. It concluded that \"nothing in our tradition allows disarmament simply because [someone] belongs to a category of people, drug users, that Congress has categorically deemed dangerous.\"</p>\n<p>The 5th Circuit and the 8th Circuit are wrong, Sauer <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1234/362144/20250602174403309_HemaniPetition.pdf\">argues</a> in\u00a0<em>Hemani</em>.\u00a0In making that case, he repeatedly states that Section 922(g)(3) \"disqualif[ies] only <em>habitual</em> users of illegal drugs from possessing firearms,\" which is not true. The ban applies to <em>all</em> consumers of federally prohibited drugs, no matter their pattern of use and regardless of whether they ever handle guns while intoxicated. It is analogous to a categorical ban on gun possession by alcohol consumers\u2014a point that Sauer obscures by equating all \"unlawful\" drug consumers with \"habitual drunkards.\"</p>\n<p>Sauer implausibly argues that all drug users, including occasional cannabis consumers and patients who use marijuana for symptom relief in compliance with state law, pose a danger to public safety that justifies disarming them. And even if there might be \"marginal cases\" where that is not true, he says, they can be addressed by seeking relief from the attorney general\u2014the same unsatisfactory solution he offers for people with nonviolent criminal records.</p>\n<p>The Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) <a href=\"https://www.firearmspolicy.org/trump-admin-enacts-fpc-proposal-to-create-new-doj-second-amendment-rights-section\">welcomed</a>\u00a0the Justice Department's Second Amendment Section as \"a major step toward properly recognizing the Second Amendment as protecting a real right that warrants the same institutional protection as all other enumerated rights.\" But it also noted that \"the DOJ continues\u2014at this moment\u2014to advance\u00a0harmful\u00a0and anti-originalist arguments in multiple ongoing cases, including efforts that would\u00a0narrow or even reverse major Second Amendment victories protecting millions of peaceable Americans.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to the Justice Department's defense of Section 922(g)(3), the FPC cited the government's position in cases involving the <a href=\"https://www.firearmspolicy.org/fpc-blasts-doj-motion-to-gut-second-amendment-victory-fires-back-in-new-court-brief\">ban</a> on guns in post offices and the National Firearms Act's <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/17/this-gun-case-harks-back-to-constitutional-concerns-about-the-limits-of-federal-power-that-now-seem-quaint/\">registration requirements</a>. The organization urged the Trump administration to \"immediately halt these contradictory litigation positions and begin supporting\u2014rather than opposing\u2014strong constitutional litigation that advances the very rights this new DOJ section is intended to protect.\"</p>\n<p>It is encouraging that the Justice Department plans to challenge policies and practices that infringe on the right to arms. But if it were serious about defending the Second Amendment, it would stop defending unjust, historically ungrounded laws that disarm Americans for no good reason.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/the-doj-says-it-will-challenge-unconstitutional-gun-policies-maybe-it-should-stop-defending-them/\">The DOJ Says It Will Challenge Unconstitutional Gun Policies.

    "full_content": "The GOP took up a challenge from Democrat Rep. Jasmine Crockett (TX-30) for people to find proof that Democrats were \"invoking violence,\" and it couldn't have backfired on her more spectacularly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs RedState reported, Crockett made headlines on Tuesday when she officially announced her run for a Senate seat in the great state of Texas.\n\nREAD MORE: New: Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett Officially Launches U.S. Senate Bid\n\nCrockett's Trainwreck Announcement Underscores Why She's Not Ready for Prime Time\n\nIn response, numerous clips have resurfaced of the crazy things the Democrat representative has said. In one example, Crockett made comments during her appearance in October on The Breakfast Club radio show (which features host Charlamagne tha God), following Charlie Kirk's assassination a month earlier.\n\nApparently, Crockett was so unaware of the massive numbers of Democrats who have incited violence against those on the right, that she apparently thought it would be hard to prove. But if you are a RedState reader, you know all too well that the proof is everywhere.\n\nDuring the lawmaker's appearance on the show, she said the following (It comes at the 7:12 minute mark):\n\n\"I challenge somebody to go and find a clip of a Democrat invoking violence.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, the GOP has accepted the challenge, sharing a short video on X on Wednesday with many clips of the vile comments, made by Democrats, calling for violence.\n\nWatch:\n\nJasmine Crockett: \u201cI challenge somebody to go and find a clip of a Democrat invoking violence.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere you go @JasmineForUS pic.twitter.com/zalak7LqJx \u2014 GOP (@GOP) December 10, 2025\n\nHere's just a sampling of what you hear in the video.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY-8): \"We're going to fight it in the courts. And we are going to fight it in the streets.\"\n\nDem Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA-14): \"When they go low, we're going to bury them below the Capitol. That's what we're going to do.\"\n\nDem Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-7): \"There needs to be unrest in the streets as long as there's unrest in our lives.\"\n\nDemocrat California Governor Gavin Newsom: \"We're walking down a damn different path. We're fighting fire with fire. And we're going to punch these sons of [....] in the mouth.\"\n\nDemocrat Rep. Derek Tran (CA-45): \"Fight back, punch back and make sure they stay down, and you know what, kick them when they're down. Because they deserve it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Crockett is featured in the clip several times, with her own invocations for violence.\n\n\"I think that you punch,\" Crockett said. \"I think you punch. I think you're okay. You okay with punching.\"\n\n\"We are not only going to punch you back, but we are going to knock you out,\" she added. \"Not only are we going to punch back, but we about to beat you down.\"\n\nSEE: Jasmine Crockett's Woman of the People Shtick Blows Up After Release of Latest FEC Filings\n\nALSO: Did Republicans Actually Trick Jasmine Crockett Into Running for Senate?\n\nThis is just more proof that those inciting/invoking violence against the other side of the political aisle are the Democrats and those on the left, not the other way around.\n\nCrockett's self-own might be funny if it weren't so disgusting and damaging to our country.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Do you enjoy RedState\u2019s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Yeah, boy, you guys are scared.\u201d\n\nA Somali college student in Minnesota has drawn significant criticism after he appeared in a social media video threatening to \u201cpop\u201d immigration agents. Hasan Mohamed, a student at Minnesota State University, posted the video on TikTok in which he stated that he would shoot ICE agents if they entered his neighborhood in Owatonna.\n\n\u201cICE, I actually heard you guys pulled up to Owatonna, the big O, and you pulled up when I was not there? Y\u2019all so puss-*ss sh*t, boy. You\u2019re gonna get popped next time I see you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBring the whole cavalry. Yeah, boy, you guys are scared.\u201d\n\nThe video was later deleted, and Mohamed appeared to issue an apology. After widespread backlash, he posted several follow-up videos describing the incident as a \u201clapse in [his] judgment,\u201d though many online responded by saying his apology seemed sarcastic rather than sincere.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect to be forgiven. I\u2019m just here to apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cI truly did not mean what I said. I was just trying to be funny.\u201d\n\nICE has continued operations throughout Minnesota as concerns grow about Somali illegal immigrants and fraud involving Somali migrants. The agency posted a video on X showing recent arrests in the state, accompanied by the caption \u201cMinnesota\u2019s weather is cloudy with a 100% chance of ICE.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanctuary policies and politicians like Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey allowed these pedophiles, domestic terrorists, and gang members to roam the streets and terrorize Americans,\u201d Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement last week about ICE activity in the state. \u201cICE law enforcement are risking their lives to protect Minnesotans while their own elected officials sit by and do nothing. No matter when and where, ICE will find, arrest, and deport ALL criminal illegal aliens.\u201d",

Smith\u2014focuses on how the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit weighed multiple IQ scores in a murder case.</p>\n\n<p>Joseph Clifton Smith was sentenced to death after a jury found him guilty of brutally murdering a man. Under Alabama law, Smith could demonstrate low intellectual functioning with an IQ of 70 or below and substantial deficits in adaptive behavior.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-872/342591/20250212131357854_2025.02.12%20--%20Hamm%20v.%20Smith%20Cert%20Petition%20FINAL.pdf\">court filings</a>, <strong>Smith received five IQ scores: 75, 74, 72, 78, and 74. When the case reached the 11th Circuit in 2023, the appeals court upheld a lower court decision vacating his death sentence.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The more controversial part of its decision was how it weighed Smith\u2019s IQ scores. Although each of the scores was above the 70-point threshold, the court said it wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Smith was intellectually disabled. Given the margin of error for IQ tests, the court said Smith\u2019s score could actually be as low as 69.</p>\n\n<p>It pointed to another Supreme Court decision\u2014Hall v. Florida\u2014which said that courts must consider the standard error of measurement when an IQ score is close to, but above, 70. It has also <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-797_n7io.pdf\">said</a> that courts should move beyond IQ and consider \u201cadaptive deficits,\u201d or things like changing behavior with different circumstances, when IQ scores are close to but above 70.</p>\n\n<p>Considering those deficits, <strong>the appeals court said Smith shouldn\u2019t receive the death penalty.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Alabama told the Supreme Court that this was the wrong approach and that Smith had a burden of proving disability by a preponderance of the evidence. Instead of focusing on the error range for a lower IQ score, courts should instead weigh the cumulative effect of multiple scores, Alabama said.</p>\n\n<p>Katherine Robertson, an attorney with the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office, told The Epoch Times that courts had strayed from the actual meaning of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>I think what we\u2019re looking for is just a return to what the Eighth Amendment actually requires, and a move away, ultimately, from all this judge-made precedent</strong>,\u201d she said. She add that \u201cour position in our office philosophically has always been: if you\u2019re competent enough to stand trial, then ... how do you get special treatment when it comes to the penalty phase?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While she wasn\u2019t asking the Supreme Court to overrule its precedent in Atkins, she said it would have to revisit it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think they\u2019re going to have to revisit it,\u201d she said, suggesting that it could foster a return to the true meaning of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>In the Atkins majority <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/536/304/\">opinion</a>, Justice John Paul Stevens said that society viewed mentally challenged individuals as less culpable than the average criminal. Among other things, he said that those individuals may be less able to give meaningful assistance to attorneys defending them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cMentally retarded defendants in the aggregate face a special risk of wrongful execution</strong>,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s unclear how the Supreme Court will rule but Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the decision in 2002.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump administration has also intervened in support of Alabama. It <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-872/369406/20250811162544896_24-872%20--%20Hamm%20v%20Smith.pdf\">argued</a> that the decision in Atkins broke from the Eighth Amendment\u2019s original meaning but also afforded states flexibility in determining intellectual disability.</p>\n\n<p>Smith\u2019s attorneys, meanwhile, defended the appeals court decision and said courts should take a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to evaluating intellectual disability. Regardless of whether IQ scores are conclusive, they said, defendants should be able to present additional evidence surrounding their intellectual functioning.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T02:30:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 21:30</span>\n",

It\u2019s perfect in pretty much every way. I love the directing, the acting, and the actors. The CGI also looks phenomenal and still holds up incredibly well today. I know that the film\u2019s length was and still is controversial, but I actually don\u2019t mind it. I personally think that the buildup to Skull Island is incredible, and I think the whole movie was paced fairly well - the first hour in New York and on the ship, the second hour on the island, and the third and final hour back in New York with Kong causing chaos. What do you all think? I think this is still the best version of Kong; I wish the newer movies had kept the 2005 design.\n\nEdit - this is in no way a diss to the other films. I like King Kong, no matter what. I just personally really enjoy this movie and think it's the best. That's just my opinion. I like having discussions and seeing them; at the end of the day, they're all good films in their own way.",

    "full_content": "The southern border and the rise (and subsequent rebirth) of Donald Trump\u2019s political fortunes are inextricably linked. In one of the more memorable campaign moments in modern history, the then-private citizen came down the golden escalator at Trump Tower to announce he was running for president, saying, \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue immediately became divisive, with opponents of cracking down on illegal immigrants claiming those who were for it were racist. As we saw, though, when Joe Biden came along with his \u201copen the floodgates\u201d policy, the Left actually has no interest in securing the border or stopping the flow of illegal drugs and aliens. In fact, they actively work against any efforts to do so.\n\nIn his '24 campaign, Trump continued to stress the importance of taking action, and that is one very big reason he was able to win a second non-consecutive term as the commander in chief.\n\nOn Wednesday, his administration focused once again on keeping the boundary secure, as the Interior Department announced new military zones on the border between Canada and Mexico:\n\nThe Department of Interior said it would transfer jurisdiction along most of California's border with Mexico to the Navy to reinforce \"the historic role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty.\" The Interior Department described the newest national defense area in California as a high-traffic zone for unlawful crossings by immigrants. But Border Patrol arrests along the southern U.S. border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since the 1960s amid President Trump's push for mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, CBS News, for pointing out that arrests by the Border Patrol have dropped to virtually zero. Why? Because of Trump\u2019s policies, like this new one. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, CBS.\n\nTake a look at what it was like under Joe Biden:\n\nAliens seeking asylum at the California US - Mexico border just south of San Ysidro port of entry.\n\n\n\nHomeland Security expects up to 13,000 crossings per day once Title 42 expires.\n\n\n\n- PoliceFrequency pic.twitter.com/ZuXXPacdi1 \u2014 suzy (@Suzy_1776) May 2, 2023\n\nThe move puts the military in charge of large swaths of what were formerly high-crossing areas:\n\nThe move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops to detain people who enter the country illegally and sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. It is done under the authority of the national emergency on the border declared by President Donald Trump on his first day in office.\n\nThe U.S. wants the zones operational to help combat the human smuggling networks and insidious drug cartels, both of which Trump has long emphasized. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a press release Wednesday that it is important to honor the \u201chistoric role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty\u201d:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy working with the Navy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use, and advancing the President's agenda.\n\nBy working with @USNavy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use and advancing @POTUS' agenda to put the safety and security of the American people FIRST! https://t.co/c2oYAdOeht \u2014 Secretary Doug Burgum (@SecretaryBurgum) December 10, 2025\n\nTrump promised over 10 years ago that he was going to fix the border \u2014 and he\u2019s been doing just that since he took up residence again in the White House in January. Promises made, promises kept.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: We voted for mass deportations, not mass amnesty. Help us continue to fight back against those trying to go against the will of the American people.\n\nJoin RedState's VIP today and use promo code FIGHT to get 60% off your VIP membership.",

When they finally got him up his face and hands were blue.\u201d\n\nHarrell, 48, told the publication that he thought the comedian, 59, had \u201cpassed away.\u201d\n\n9 An eyewitness to Andy Dick\u2019s apparent overdose told The Post that the actor turned blue.\n\n9 Local security guard Shawn Harrell said he needed multiple doses of Narcan to be revived.\n\n\u201cThey started spraying Narcan and tapping him on the chest,\u201d Harrell recalled of the bystanders who administered the lifesaving drug, which effectively reverses opioid overdoses.\n\n\u201cThey were trying to keep him awake because he was non-responsive. They used more than one Narcan.\u201d\n\nHarrell also recalled the paramedics coming and people \u201ccrowding around\u201d the \u201cNewsradio\u201d alum, and noted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be part of the commotion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stood back and watched them do what they did,\u201d he added of the Tuesday incident, which he estimated to be around 10 minutes.\n\n9 Harrell estimated the incident to be about 10 minutes long.\n\n9 \u201cWhen it was all said and done he was back to normal,\u201d Harrell said of Dick, seen here in 2022. BACKGRID\n\n\u201cThe paramedics had already left when the police were talking to him,\u201d Harrell explained. \u201cI was shocked they left him here.\u201d\n\nHarrell then recalled that although Dick \u201cwasn\u2019t saying anything\u201d following the incident, \u201cWhen it was all said and done he was back to normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like nothing happened,\u201d Harrell shared. \u201cHe stood up and looked around, was walking around.\u201d\n\nAfter the \u201cAndy Dick Show\u201d personality was revived, Harrell joked to him, saying, \u201cHey, man, you left here and came back.\u201d\n\n9 Harrell said it was like \u201cnothing happened\u201d following the incident.\n\nHarrell noted, \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about people getting high and when they try to bring them back they don\u2019t want to come back.\u201d\n\nThe security guard also said he recognized the actor, but \u201cdidn\u2019t really know who the hell he was\u201d and described him as appearing \u201cclean-cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watch a lot of comedy,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cHis face looked familiar but I couldn\u2019t put a name on it.\u201d\n\nHarrell admitted that the chaotic scene was surreal. \u201cThere were some guys with cell phone cameras,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI thought it was part of a movie.\u201d\n\nWant more celebrity and pop culture news?

no one wants to watch these movies.\u00a0 However, some distributors can't help themselves as they search foreign markets to purchase far-left content and get their ideological fix.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The newest foreign art house slop making it's way to Netflix audiences in the US this month is a movie called \"Queen Of Coal\", originally titled \"Miss Carbon\" in Argentina where the flick was originally released.\u00a0 Pedro Pascal plays a role in the film (of course he does), and it's set to hit Netflix on December 19th.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The story is a docudrama based on the true story of an 18-year-old man named\u00a0Carlos Antonella Rodr\u00edguez\u00a0who gets work as a coal miner in 2011.\u00a0 He then \"transitions\" over the course of a few years to become a transgender woman named \"Carlita\" (take note of the almost worshipful manner in which the trans character is portrayed).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yb6RMRrXnJ8\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Carlos is officially recognized as a woman under an Argentina law enacted on May 23, 2012.\u00a0 It was the world's first legislation to allow legal gender recognition based on self-identification, without requiring medical interventions, psychological diagnoses, or judicial approval (this might be something that Javier Milei should look into).\u00a0 The man was then declared the \"first woman coal miner\" in Argentina's history.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>That's right, a man dressed up as a woman defeated the patriarchy for all women because he is now legally considered a real woman in Argentina.\u00a0 In other words, this is a lot like Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner) winning Glamour Magazine's \"woman of the year.\"\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Netflix describes the movie as:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Carlita, a trans woman, dreams of working in the coal mines but faces superstitions and a ban on female workers, forcing her to fight for her place and disrupt the system.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/QueenCoal2.jpg?itok=K5TDSrec\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/QueenCoal2.jpg?itok=K5TDSrec\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"13661f7d-41f5-4045-89db-71c72bdd1369\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"631\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/QueenCoal2.jpg?itok=K5TDSrec\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Some might wonder why anyone would \"dream\" of becoming a coal miner.\u00a0 No one does, but in Argentina in 2012 coal mining was considered a higher paying job ($1500 per month US).\u00a0 Carlos does not actually extract coal, he repairs machinery that helps in the mining of coal, but is technically considered a \"coal miner\".</p>\n\n<p>Some people might remember the explosive controversy over Netflix's distribution of the 2020 film \"Cuties\" - A French movie featuring 11-year-old girls in a highly sexualized dance troupe.\u00a0 Critics accused the filmmakers of creating thinly veiled child pornography disguised as feminist empowerment.\u00a0 The film's director is a female Muslim feminist from Senegal who grew up in a polygamous family.\u00a0 Around 10% of Senegalese Muslim marriages involve minors under the age of 15.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The foreign feature did not go over well with American audiences, except for leftist activists who widely defended the movie and even argued in favor of the child dance scenes.\u00a0 Much was revealed about the political left in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There has been a similar reaction with the announcement of Queen Of Coal:\u00a0 Audiences are laughing at the concept while rejecting the basic premise that a man can become a women and then be declared the \"first woman coal miner\".\u00a0 It does not appear that the film will draw many viewers for Netflix, but it does showcase why Netflix's attempted purchase of Warner Bros. is very bad for movie goers.\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T03:45:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 22:45</span>\n",

Gavin Newsom sued to block the deployment, the Trump administration took the position that \u201cafter a valid initial federalization, all subsequent re-federalizations are completely, and forever, unreviewable by the courts,\u201d the judge wrote.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cDefendants\u2019 position is contrary to law,\u201d </strong>and, coupled with the Trump administration\u2019s deployment of California National Guard troops to other states, is \u201ceffectively creating a national police force made up of state troops,\u201d the judge added.</em></p>\n\n<p>Breyer stayed his preliminary injunction until noon on Dec. 15, presumably to give the federal government an opportunity to appeal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Newsom hailed the ruling.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is abundantly clear \u2013 the federalization of the National Guard in California is illegal and must end,\u201d the governor said in a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/12/10/federal-court-to-trump-keeping-a-standing-army-is-illegal-the-federalization-of-californias-national-guard-must-end/\">statement</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe President deployed these brave men and women against their own communities, removing them from essential public safety operations.

Local and state officials strongly criticized the effort, saying the federal government was overstepping its legal authority.</p>\n\n<p>The high court order paused a temporary restraining order that Judge Maame Frimpong of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued on July 11 that limited the factors that law enforcement officials may use when making immigration-related stops and arrests.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, Frimpong barred the Department of Homeland Security from stopping or arresting individuals based exclusively on factors such as the language the person speaks or where the person works.</p>\n\n<p>In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \u201cWe should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh filed a concurring opinion.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cApparent ethnicity alone\u201d is not enough to establish the reasonable suspicion needed to justify an immigration stop, but it may be relevant to the issue,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T03:20:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Wed, 12/10/2025 - 22:20</span>\n",

Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., of joining a \"rioting crowd\" and attempting to interfere with agents during a mass arrest operation last week.</p><p>The accusation came after Grijalva claimed she was \"<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-fires-back-dem-lawmaker-claims-she-pushed-aside-pepper-sprayed-during-ice-raid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pushed aside and pepper sprayed</a>\" during an immigration raid on Dec. 5 in Tucson, an account ICE flatly rejected.</p><p>\"During the operation, U.S. Representative Adelita Grijalva joined the rioting crowd and attempted to impede law enforcement officers, then took to social media to slander law enforcement by falsely claiming she was pepper sprayed,\" ICE said in a statement.</p><p>Fox News Digital has reached out to Grijalva\u2019s office for comment.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-rejects-rep-lamonica-mcivers-bid-toss-assault-case-says-her-actions-legislative-purpose\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>JUDGE REJECTS REP.

She wasn\u2019t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who was pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.\"</p><p>ICE said two people in the crowd were arrested \u2013 one for assaulting a federal law enforcement officer and another for damaging a government vehicle. Two Homeland Security Investigation Special Response Team operators were also injured.</p><p>When reached for comment, DHS referred Fox News Digital to ICE\u2019s statement on the operation.

U.N. officials have described UNRWA as the backbone of Gaza\u2019s aid effort during the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, but the Trump administration has accused the group of ties to Hamas \u2013 an allegation the agency vehemently disputes.</p><p>Washington, once UNRWA\u2019s biggest donor, froze funding in January 2024 after Israel accused roughly a dozen staff members of involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that triggered the war.</p><p>In October, Secretary of State <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/marco-rubio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marco Rubio</a> referred to UNRWA as a subsidiary of Hamas.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/new-film-probes-un-agencys-alleged-terror-ties-claims-fueled-israeli-palestinian-conflict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>NEW FILM PROBES UN AGENCY\u2019S ALLEGED TERROR TIES AND CLAIMS IT FUELED THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT</strong></a></p><p>\"UNRWA's not going to play any role in it,\" Rubio said at the time when asked whether the agency would assist in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. \"The United Nations is here. They're on the ground. We're willing to work with them if they can make it work, but not UNRWA. UNRWA became a subsidiary of Hamas.\"</p><p>Reuters reported it was unclear whether recent internal discussions focused on sanctioning the entire agency or specific officials or operations, and that U.S. officials have not yet settled on what type of sanctions they might pursue.</p><p>The sources said the State Department has discussed declaring UNRWA a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" or FTO \u2013 a step that would financially isolate the agency.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-under-fire-usaid-investigators-probe-hamas-diversion-aid-gaza\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>UN UNDER FIRE AS USAID INVESTIGATORS PROBE HAMAS DIVERSION OF AID TO GAZA</strong></a></p><p>Any broad move against UNRWA could disrupt refugee aid across the region, as the agency is already facing a severe funding crisis.

A willingness to engage with people he disagreed with, a willingness to debate \u2014 to the extent that he thought \u2014 in a fair and balanced way. I think there\u2019s grace in that,\" he told Klein on \"The Ezra Klein Show.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/charlie-kirk-finished-final-book-one-month-before-shooting-widow-reveals-transformation-brought\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CHARLIE KIRK FINISHED FINAL BOOK ONE MONTH BEFORE SHOOTING, WIDOW REVEALS TRANSFORMATION IT BROUGHT</strong></a></p><p>The governor added that Kirk \"understood more deeply the pain that young men are facing and struggling with\" and was able to \"do something about it and give them hope and recognize that society is failing young men.\"</p><p>Speaking on the struggles facing young men, Newsom conceded that \"if you\u2019re 30 years old, you\u2019re the first generation living that\u2019s not doing better than your parents,\" noting that there is a growing sense of nihilism among that demographic.</p><p>He said he felt that same nihilism while speaking to young men at a recent event, pointing out that <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/charlie-kirk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kirk had a strong understanding</a> of this phenomenon.</p><p>\"I went down to TwitchCon and was there with a lot of gamers, really trying to get into the belly of the beast of understanding where young men are and this pain and suffering, this isolation, that\u2019s turning increasingly to grievance that they\u2019re never going to do better than their parents. They\u2019re never going to get out of that room with three roommates. They can\u2019t even afford rent because they can\u2019t afford the first two months\u2019 payment on the rent, let alone buy a home,\" he recalled.\u00a0</p><p>\"And this nihilism Kirk understood. Certainly Trump understood it, as well. He took advantage of it.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/charlie-kirks-final-book-told-conservatives-stop-being-smug-lazy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CHARLIE KIRK WARNED CONSERVATIVES AGAINST LAZINESS, SMUGNESS AND COWARDICE IN FINAL POLITICAL BOOK</strong></a></p><p>While Newsom praised Kirk \u2014 and even President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump</a> \u2014 for their understanding of the unique situation that young men are in, he argued that \"they have no prescriptions to address it and deal with it.\"</p><p>\"Of course, I only had an hour-and-a-half conversation with Charlie, but where it seems to me to have fallen short with Turning Point USA and the MAGA movement is they don\u2019t have a prescription to actually address the real and substantive issues, but they sure as hell identify the problem,\" he asserted.</p><p>Klein followed up by questioning whether Newsom had just laid out Kirk's prescription for the problem, \"Tariffs, a closed border and Christianity.\"</p><p>Newsom didn't directly answer Klein's question but noted that \"Christianity is a big part\" before recounting a story from one of his interactions with Kirk during their interview.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS</u></strong></a></p><p>\"I lazily said, \"Jesus!\" and he got offended. And then I said it again, and I realized, \u2018Boy, I really am offending him now. Forgive me,\u2019\" he recalled. \"I didn\u2019t understand how deeply held his faith was and how much of an organizing principle it was for him as well.\"</p><p>Although the governor admitted he's more spiritual than religious, he acknowledged the value in Kirk building a movement that merged \"creating community, a sense of belonging, meaning, identity.\"</p><p>Newsom added that while \"there are a lot of grievances\" he holds about some of Kirk's views, \"there are also a lot of grievances I have in this space, that my party has completely neglected this space, that we haven\u2019t been organizing the campuses.\"</p><p>\"We haven\u2019t been organizing young men. We haven\u2019t been addressing their societal screams, their concerns. Their suicide rate \u2014 four times that of women. Their dropout rates. Their depths of despair. We have men who are suffering, and it\u2019s hurting women. Any mother understands this,\" he explained.</p><p>Wrapping up his reflection on Kirk's impact on young men, Newsom recalled how excited his son was when he found out that he was interviewing the TPUSA founder, telling his father, \"You really need to get to know him, Dad.\"</p><p>\"I started to wake up to this reality that the Democratic Party needs to wake up to. And that\u2019s, again, the entry into why I did this podcast and had those folks on as first guests,\" he shared.</p>",

    "full_content": "The cruelty that has been heaped on Charlie Kirk\u2019s widow, Erika, since his assassination three months ago has been unrelenting.\n\nFirst it was leftist ghouls cheering on his cold-blooded murder, in front of a crowd of 3,000 people at the first stop of his Turning Point USA \u201cAmerican Comeback Tour\u201d outdoors on the campus of Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.\n\nThe ghouls gloried in the death of the young father of two, mimicked the instant the bullet hit his throat, created T-shirts with his image and gushes of blood to celebrate the moment his voice was silenced.\n\n\u201cThis is righteous anger, because this is not OK. It\u2019s not healthy. This is a mind virus,\u201d Erika Kirk told Harris Faulkner on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOutnumbered\u201d of her ghoulish tormentors. Getty Images\n\nIt could not have been a more public execution.\n\nHe was shot dead on livestream, with hundreds of cellphones capturing graphic footage of the atrocity. \u00ad\n\nEvery member of the TPUSA team was traumatized by what they saw that day and their unsuccessful efforts to save his life.\n\nSadists and freaks recorded TikToks with millions of views, dancing on his grave.\n\nGoFundMes popped up to help the alleged killer, 22-year-old furry lover Tyler Robinson, who is facing 10 felony counts in Utah, including aggravated murder.\n\nBy now, conservatives know the left is a vile death cult full of broken people tipped over the edge by social media.\n\nBut what has been far worse than the leftist haters are right-wing-adjacent grifters and nuts pushing wicked conspiracy theories about Charlie\u2019s murder, pointing the finger at his colleagues, friends and even Erika herself.\n\nThese fantasies have been peddled primarily by former prominent TPUSA luminary Candace Owens on her hit podcast, which gets more than 40 million views for her wildest rants.\n\nShe has claimed Israeli Mossad agents, men in maroon shirts, the US military, Egyptian planes, Jewish donors and the French government are somehow complicit.\n\nShe endlessly plays videos of that awful day and theorizes about the \u201cexit wound\u201d or lack thereof.\n\nJust asking questions?\n\nWorst of all, she torments Charlie\u2019s widow by suggesting in a disingenuous \u201cjust asking questions\u201d way that Charlie was \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the people who loved him most.\n\nHer proof?\n\nA dream.\n\n\u201cI had a very vivid dream whereupon Charlie told me that he had been betrayed.\u201d\n\nShe has thrown suspicion on Charlie\u2019s pastor, his chief of staff, his chief operating officer, his spokesman, the camera guy, you name it.\n\nEvery week, Post columnist Miranda Devine sits down for exclusive and candid conversations with the most influential disruptors in Washington on \u2018Pod Force One.\u2019 Subscribe here!\n\nShe plays clips of their reactions the moment Charlie was shot and claims they looked guilty.\n\nShe is suspicious that TPUSA supposedly won\u2019t give her their footage of Charlie\u2019s murder that she laughably claims she needs so she can \u201cdebunk all these internet conspiracies.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about this is wrong,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI helped to build that organization, so I am almost the perfect person to discern what is normal and what is abnormal.\u201d\n\nShe also claims: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to be on the side of goodness and truth no matter what the cost is.\u201d\n\nHer daily tantalizing drip feed of absurdities cashing in on her former friend\u2019s death has made her millions of dollars.\n\nThe more bizarre and dishonest the lies, the more clicks, because that\u2019s the way the online ecosphere works.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Erika Kirk erupted in a controlled demolition of Owens and all who amplify her toxicity.\n\n\u201cThis is righteous anger, because this is not OK. It\u2019s not healthy. This is a mind virus,\u201d she told Harris Faulkner on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOutnumbered\u201d program in an appearance to promote the publication of her husband\u2019s final book, \u201cStop, in the Name of God.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want justice for my husband, for myself, for my family, more than anyone else out there. But here\u2019s my breaking point on that. Come after me, call me names, I don\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cCall me what you want, go down that rabbit hole, whatever.\u201d\n\nGet Miranda\u2019s latest take Sign up for Devine Online, the newsletter from Miranda Devine Thanks for signing up!

Check out more newsletters\n\nErika\u2019s courage\n\n\u201cBut when you go after \u2026 the people that I love, and you\u2019re making hundreds and thousands of dollars, every single episode going after the people that I love [saying] because somehow they\u2019re in on this? No.\u201d\n\nWith courage and graceful intensity, she explained why she so far has remained silent in the face of ever more cruel clickbait: \u201cMy silence does not mean that somehow, Turning Point USA, and all of the handpicked staff that loved my husband \u2014 and my husband loved them \u2014 is somehow in on it.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Erika turned to the camera and pointedly addressed the conspiracy theorists:\n\n\u201cJust know that your words are very powerful, and we are human. My team are not machines, and they\u2019re not robots. We have more death threats on our team and our side than I have ever seen \u2026 What are we supposed to do? Relive that trauma all over again?\u201d\n\nThe best part was that Erika never mentioned the name of the woman who TPUSA insiders say is afflicted by \u201cfirst wife\u201d syndrome.\n\nThey say Owens is consumed by jealousy that Erika has been appointed CEO of TPUSA, following Charlie\u2019s express wishes to the board and colleagues and captured on video.\n\n\u201cShe is a woman scorned,\u201d one TPUSA insider said of Owens.\n\n\u201cShe was iced out of TPUSA \u2026 She was not close to Charlie \u2014 he kept her at arm\u2019s length. He knew the best tack on her was to keep her on ice \u2026 She was not invited to Charlie\u2019s wedding.\u201d\n\nCharlie continued to exchange light, friendly text messages with Owens to try to stop her attacking TPUSA.\n\nThere are a lot of people who could inherit Charlie\u2019s mantle as the conservative Christian on campus rescuing young people\u2019s souls.\n\nBut Owens is the last person he would have chosen.\n\nShe was associated with TPUSA for only two years and resigned/was pushed out in 2019 after being pilloried for a comment that seemed to excuse Adolf Hitler.\n\nAfter Charlie\u2019s death, she expressed the fantasy that \u201cthe band maybe was going to get back together.\u201d\n\nAt first, Charlie\u2019s family and colleagues decided to ignore the bile.\n\nBut last week, his inner team, who have been running his podcast since he died, finally invited Owens to come on the show and clear the air.\n\nThey have spent all week negotiating with her but say she keeps making excuses for why she can\u2019t go to their studio in Phoenix, including that there is a \u00adlocal \u201ccartel\u201d that wants to assassinate her.\n\nShe has also claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 who is suing her for defamation over her prolonged claims that his wife, Brigitte, is really a man \u2014 has ordered her assassination.\n\nOf course, she claims there\u2019s an Israeli in the assassin squad.\n\nIn any case, next Tuesday, \u201cThe Charlie Kirk Show\u201d will debunk all the nonsense, with or without Owens.",

    "content": "Re-watching the scene with Aurelio and Tarasov: the first few times I watched these scenes I was thinking of it as Aurelio owing John respect, and being disgusted by Tarasov's behavior. But re-watching it now, I realize that Aurelio is absolutely *terrified*. He realizes that if John thinks for a moment that he's helped Tarasov that he's dead, whereas if he humiliates Tarsov and kicks him out at least he has a chance of surviving Viggo's wrath. Both the scenes with Tarasov and the scenes with John he's basically making the case for his life, just in different ways.\n\nIt's easy to miss because John doesn't show any overt hostility towards Aurelio but part of Reeves' performance is he doesn't often show that, and the (apparently) calm drinking scene where Aurelio pours John a drink and they have the brief conversation about Tarasov is still one fraught with tension.\n\nAurelio's anxiousness is most evident when Tarasov first shows up with the car. It's not just Aurelio being disdainful of Tarasov, he's acutely aware that now he's involved, and knows that John's going to show up at some point. And if John thinks Aurelio helped Tarasov that he's a dead man. It's honestly a fantastic performance from Leguizamo, an all time great character actor, demonstrating a mix of emotions that I think often gets overlooked. It's honestly kind of amusing that he's demonstrating less fear during the conversation with Viggo (although not none) than he is when he's talking to Tarasov.",

The pilot was honestly not that funny or fun to me, and the premise felt like it was forcing itself to be the cheerleading version of Glee. That said, episode 4 though? Something clicked. Maybe it was just the hilarious guest star Jeff Hiller playing a corporate Willy Wonka factory owner with an absolutely stupid accent, or just that the show stopped trying so hard, but I finally see a glimmer of fun here, and I hope it continues through the rest of the season (and maybe onwards).\n\nI'd love to hear what other viewers think.",

    "content": "I just finished Hulu\u2019s All\u2019s Fair season 1. The show was fine imo. Pretty on brand with all that Ryan Murphy does: great idea, okay execution, campy fun mixed with BIG emotions in a way that doesn\u2019t always work and of course a lot of pointless sex.\n\nThe show was a critical failure even before it came out and I won\u2019t go into why (hint: people hate women). One thing that people keep bringing up is that Kim Kardashian is an awful actor. I however disagree.\n\nOf course it\u2019s important to point out that Kim is not an actor. She\u2019s a\u2026 daughter of Kris Jenner and I mean good for her. I\u2019m not too familiar with her work as an influencer and have never watched her reality show.\n\nFor me this is one case where I doubt she would be a good casting choice for any other role on any other show but in All\u2019s Fair her performance works for me. I mean she is just playing herself and doing a good job at it. Her performance is believable although it doesn\u2019t pull on too many emotions but that fits the character.\n\nI think her lack of versatility may become a problem if they try to expand on her character in later seasons but for S1 it worked for me. I don\u2019t think she needs an Emmy but people love to hate just for the sake of hating.\n\nEnd disclaimer: I don\u2019t think she should take job opportunities from real actors but I don\u2019t think that that is what happened here. To me it seems like she asked her friend (Murphy) to create a show where she can play a lawyer since she doesn\u2019t seem to be able to pass the bar thus creating jobs for struggling actors like Glenn Close (/j).\n\nTL;DR:\nI think that Kim\u2019s performance worked for this role quite well and all the hate is unnecessary.",

Daily Mail readers, meanwhile, have been told that the budget has taken from hard-working families to give to benefit claimants.</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly what the powers-that-be want people to believe, not only as the old divide-and-rule strategy, but because society needs to understand that jobs are disappearing rapidly, and the future is basic universal income and total dependence on the state.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The looming technocracy has no use for the majority of the workforce.</strong> Data and distribution centres will be run by robots. Artificial intelligence will rise through the occupational strata to replace professional practitioners such as lawyers and doctors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Call it new technology<br />\nAnd they use it to burn<br />\nAnd they show no concern<br />\nWork for their prosperity<br />\nWhile the big wheels turn<br />\nNow it\u2019s too late to learn<br />\nDon\u2019t upset the teacher<br />\nThough we know he lied to you<br />\nDon\u2019t upset the preacher<br />\nHe\u2019s gonna close his eyes for you</p>\n\n<p>And it\u2019s a shame<br />\nThat you\u2019re so afraid<br />\nJust a worker waiting in the pouring rain<br />\nPutting back the pieces of a broken dream</p>\n\n<p>Father worked in industry<br />\nNow the work has moved on<br />\nAnd the factory\u2019s gone<br />\nSee them sell your history<br />\nWhere once you were strong<br />\nAnd you used to belong<br />\nThere was once a future<br />\nFor a working man<br />\nThere was once a lifetime<br />\nFor a skillful hand \u2013 yesterday</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prophetic words by the band Erasure, back in 1986.<strong> But most people do not heed the warnings, preferring to shoot the messenger.</strong></p>\n\n<p>A talented OffGuardian writer, Todd Hayen, has decided to stop writing due to the abusive responses to\u00a0<a href=\"https://off-guardian.org/2025/11/29/it-isnt-that-big-of-a-deal/\">his latest article</a>\u00a0on the persistent faith of citizens in government and in official narratives. He used the term \u2018sheep\u2019 for the easily herded folk who take the vaccines and believe in the scripted saviours and bogeymen.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Funny how the same people can be utterly convinced that their own pet catastrophes\u2014Trump returning to power, climate change, systemic racism, white supremacy, overpopulation, or the rise of the far right\u2014are existential threats that will end life as we know it unless we surrender every freedom immediately to stop them. But mention digital id, central bank digital currencies, vaccine passports, social credit systems, or the creeping transhumanist agenda, and suddenly you\u2019re the paranoid one wearing a tinfoil hat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The threats to humanity are \u2013 or at least should be \u2013 emphatically clear. A digital prison is being built around us, with the implicit consent of the \u2018sheep\u2019, who still think that technology will solve our problems. Convenience, security and efficiency are prized over meaningful social interaction, privacy and freedom. As Hayen explained, this delusion was primed long ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of them have been psychologically and educationally groomed for decades to believe that socialism, Marxism, or outright communism are not only benign but morally superior. \u2018From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\u2019 sounds noble when you\u2019ve never watched the state decide what your needs actually are. They think communism is free healthcare, student-debt forgiveness, and government UBI cheques. They have no idea it\u2019s secret police at 3 a.m., neighbours denouncing neighbours for extra bread rations, gulags, re-education camps, forced confessions, and a boot stamping on a human face\u2014forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am no less against global corporate capitalism and fascism as I am of leftist totalitarianism, but merely a minority of critical thinkers see through the Left versus Right paradigm. Ask a progressive liberal student whether she\u2019d expect a fascist government to give free money to everyone in society, of whatever colour or creed, and she\u2019d probably scoff at such a ridiculous notion. Welfare is a thing of the Left \u2013 that\u2019s how younger generations are taught to love Big Brother.</p>\n\n<p>Britons are led to believe that the government will always be there as a safety net, when the jobs are gone. Therefore, they don\u2019t threaten aa uprising on the throwing of taxpayers\u2019 money at Ukraine or on the perpetual influx \u2013 a million every year \u2013 of immigrants whose cheap labour will be a temporary pursuit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The budget is misunderstood by the majority as a giveaway to the workshy. It is really setting the scene for digitally-controlled UBI, and everything else is a sideshow. Or as Erasure called it, \u2018The Circus\u2019.</strong></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T08:30:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Thu, 12/11/2025 - 03:30</span>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Father of five here, and founder of a social media marketing company (exited).   Our kids are up against problems we didn't have during the great expansion of social. The three big things:<p>1. State level actors and well funded not for profits are fighting an information war to influence our kids. And they are very good at it. Down to having troll farms to talk one on one. Every time something new happens in the world, my younger kids ask me about what they saw on Tik-Tok and their initial understanding is shaped by a well funded actor, and is often completely a false narrative. The solution is be open and talk about it with your kids.<p>2. Criminals are even better at social than state level actors. They are smooth. And they are on platforms you wouldn't expect - like games. And criminals aren't all about fraud. They sell drugs, they try to physically steal in real life from your kids,they'll try to get your kids to do something embarrasing and blackmail them with it, and even can be human traffickers. Again, the solution is be open and talk about it with your kids - and make sure they know it's ok to ask, and it's especially ok if you think I shouldn't share this with Dad or they person is saying not to show your parents.<p>3. Sexual predators are even better at social than the criminals. The difference is that the predators can't hide behind national borders so they are very careful. Same solution as $#2, but this one is really tough because when your kids come to you about it, they may have shared something with the predator that the predator is using to extort them into hooking up. Don't attack or blame your kid, focus on making sure the predator never gets to them<p>I do not believe for a minute that social media was good for my kids as they grew up, but I'm not sure that you can even begin to fix it the way AU is trying to - regulating speech, association using prohibition is dipping a colander in the river to filter the silt.</p>\n",

In an opinion written by Judge Stephanos Bibas, the court acknowledged the difficult decisions facing terminally ill patients but said the option remains limited under state law.</p><p>\"Death brings good things to an end, but rarely neatly,\" U.S. Circuit Court Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote in the opinion issued last week. \"Many terminally ill patients face a grim reality: imminent, painful death.

A New Jersey doctor who wanted to treat patients from nearby states also joined the challenge, as did other plaintiffs who have since passed away or retired.</p><p>One of the plaintiffs, Dr. Paul Bryman, said he was disappointed by the ruling. \"Terminal patients outside New Jersey should have the option of medical aid in dying without having to travel long distances,\" he said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/delawares-assisted-suicide-bill-signed-law-making-11th-state-statute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DELAWARE'S ASSISTED SUICIDE BILL SIGNED INTO LAW, MAKING IT THE 11TH STATE WITH SUCH A STATUTE</strong></a></p><p>New Jersey Gov. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/phil-murphy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Phil Murphy</a>, a Democrat, signed the measure into law in 2019, saying at the time that while his Catholic faith might prevent him from choosing assisted suicide for himself, he supported the right of others to make that decision.</p><p>Under the law, a patient must be an adult New Jersey resident with a terminal diagnosis and a prognosis of six months or fewer to live. Two physicians must confirm the diagnosis and the patient\u2019s capacity to decide. Patients must make two requests \u2014 at least one of them in writing with two witnesses \u2014 and must be given the opportunity to rescind.</p><p>At least one witness cannot be a family member, heir, attending physician or an employee of the facility where the patient receives care.

These platforms are expected to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to prevent those younger than age 16 in the country from having or signing up for accounts, <a href=\"https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/which-platforms-are-age-restricted\">according</a> to the Australian eSafety Commissioner website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Companies failing in this regard <a href=\"https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/faqs\">face</a> fines of up to AU$49.5 million (US$32.9 million).</strong></p>\n\n<p>The restrictions were brought in amid <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/doctors-back-australias-under-16-social-media-ban-citing-youth-mental-health-issues-5956102\">concerns</a> over mental health, online harms, and screen addiction affecting Australian children.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEnforcing a minimum account age of 16 will create normative change and give young people a reprieve from powerful and persuasive design features built to keep them hooked, often enabling harmful content and conduct online,\u201d Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant <a href=\"https://www.esafety.gov.au/newsroom/media-releases/australia-makes-history-with-the-social-media-minimum-age\">said</a> in a statement on Dec. 10.</p>\n\n<p><strong>She said that although no single measure is a \u201csilver bullet,\u201d the restrictions are part of a holistic approach that includes education and outreach.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The eSafety Commissioner <a href=\"https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/faqs\">website</a> states that platforms must use <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/australias-under-16-social-media-ban-starts-dec-10-how-will-it-work-5955049\">measures</a> for age verification that respect privacy laws and digital rights, suggesting that platforms use \u201cage-related signals\u201d to work out whether someone is underage, such as how long an account has been active, analysis of the user\u2019s language level, and behavioral and interaction signals.</p>\n\n<p>The website <a href=\"https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions/faqs\">states</a> that people who do have to prove their identity will not be forced to use a government ID, saying that the Social Media Minimum Age legislation \u201cspecifically prohibits platforms from compelling Australians to provide a government-issued ID or use an Australian Government accredited digital ID service to prove their age.\u201d Platforms may offer it as an option but must also offer a reasonable alternative.</p>\n\n<h2>Global Issue</h2>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>This is the day when Australian families are taking back power from these big tech companies, and they\u2019re asserting the right of kids to be kids and for parents to have greater peace of mind</strong>,\u201d Albanese <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR-rjx68s-4\">told</a> ABC News Australia on Dec. 10.</p>\n\n<p>When asked what advice he can give to parents and children concerned about the impact of the loss of social media profiles, the prime minister said families need to have that discussion and talk these issues through.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe understand that this is going to be difficult,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cBut <strong>it is so important that young people are given the opportunity to actually grow as young humans and to differentiate</strong>, as well, between what is real in human interactions and what they can often be exposed to online.\u201d</p>\n<a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28459%29.jpg?itok=xDtwdxci\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/image_80%28459%29.jpg?itok=xDtwdxci\"><picture><figure role=\"group\" class=\"caption caption-img inline-images image-style-inline-images\"><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"619e0d30-d34c-40b9-ab46-cd2d59f4f142\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/image_80%28459%29.jpg?itok=xDtwdxci\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"500\" /><figcaption><em>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese speaks to reporters during a news conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, on Aug. 26, 2025.

Other countries, including <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/malaysia-to-follow-australia-with-social-media-ban-for-children-under-16-post-5948964\">Malaysia</a> and Denmark, as well as various states across the United States, are either bringing in similar controls or attempting to.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>New technology can do wonderful things, but we need to make sure that humans are in control of our own destiny,</strong> and that is what this is about, particularly focused on our youngest Australians,\u201d Albanese said.</p>\n\n<h2>US, Australian Parents Back Bans</h2>\n\n<p>A recent survey <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/australian-us-parents-support-a-social-media-ban-but-their-children-dont-new-study-finds-5956029\">found</a> that most parents in Australia and the United States are in favor of social media bans for those younger than 16.</p>\n\n<p>The Family Online Safety Institute found that 65 percent of Australian parents and 58 percent of U.S. parents supported such measures. Support among children aged 10 to 17 was much lower; 38 percent of young Australians and 36 percent of young Americans were in favor.</p>\n\n<p>In its report, <a href=\"https://fosi.org/research/a-ban-briefing-children-and-parents-perceptions-of-social-media-and-classroom-smartphone-bans-in-the-u-s-and-australia/\">published</a> on Dec. 9, the institute found that 52 percent of U.S. parents and 42 percent of Australian parents are confident that social media bans will protect children\u2019s mental health. Lower percentages of American (43 percent) and Australian (33 percent) youth hold the same view.</p>\n\n<p>However, both age groups shared the same beliefs about whether such bans would reduce young people\u2019s overall screen use.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMany children, 64 percent in the U.S. and 59 percent in Australia, say that with a social media ban in place, they would spend more time on other digital platforms, including video games or text messaging,\u201d the report <a href=\"https://fosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Children-Parents-Perceptions-of-Social-Media-and-Classroom-Smartphone-Bans-in-the-U.S.-and-Australia.pdf\">states</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>This could indicate that total screen time could remain the same, just with a shift to different digital platforms.</strong>\u201d</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T14:35:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Thu, 12/11/2025 - 09:35</span>\n",

The purported details sound straight out of a Hollywood movie:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The Wall Street Journal, though, said she <strong>wore a wig and a disguise</strong> when she began her journey on Monday. First, she left her hideout in a Caracas suburb where she had been living for nearly a year, heading for a coastal fishing village.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Two people helped her flee. The trio passed 10 military checkpoints, avoiding capture each time, on a nerve-wracking 10-hour trip, before reaching the coast around midnight, the newspaper said. They then began a <strong>perilous trip across the open Caribbean Sea to Curacao in an open wooden fishing skiff</strong>.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>According to the WSJ, the US military was informed of her crossing, to avoid the boat being targeted by airstrikes. Machado confirmed on Thursday that she had US support.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Machado arrived in Curacao around 3:00 pm (1900 GMT) on Tuesday. She was <strong>met by a private contractor who specializes in extractions</strong> and was supplied by the Trump administration,\" according to the WSJ account.</p>\n\n<p>Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, had accepted the Nobel Prize in her place as she had missed the award ceremony - apparently by a mere hours. But Thursday's appearance can be thought of as her post-award press conference.</p>\n\n<p>To be expected, she used the opportunity to again call for regime change in her own country, calling it a <strong>\"criminal hub\"</strong>. She's calling on the international community to intervene and \"cut those sources.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The regime is using the resources \u2014 the cash flows that come from illegal activities, including the black market of oil \u2014 not to give food for hungry children, not for teachers who earn $1 a day, not to hospitals in Venezuela that do not have medicine or water, not for security.

But evidence is thin to non-existent, and exists more in the imaginations of 24/7 Fox News consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Machado also expressed support for the US military intercepting and seizing Venezuelan oil tankers, and sanctioning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-nobel-venezuela-maduro-trump.html\">her country</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Mr. Maduro\u2019s <strong>largest corporate partner is Chevron</strong>, the American energy company, which has<strong> continued to export Venezuelan oil to the United States</strong> despite Mr. Trump\u2019s military escalation.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In response to questions about the seizure of the oil tanker, Ms. Machado said that <strong>she supported cutting the funds of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government</strong>.

While the sector has powered the S&P 500\u2019s stunning rally this year, spending fears have prompted some investors to rotate into other areas as the US economic outlook remains robust.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Markets have grown far more wary of AI-related spending, which is a sharp contrast with mid-2025 when anything hinting at higher capex sparked excitement,\u201d</strong> said Susana Cruz, a strategist at Panmure Liberum. \u201cOracle has been the weakest link in all this, largely because it\u2019s funding a big chunk of its investment with debt.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to reboot excitement in the sector, Microsoft\u2019s CEO said the company will unveil a new model on Friday that is \u201cgoing to take agents to the next level.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Oracle\u2019s earnings landed after the S&P 500 closed just shy of a record on Wednesday, lifted by a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut and Chair\u00a0Jerome Powell\u2019s sanguine economic outlook.

So the S&P 500 (+0.67%) closed less than 0.1% beneath its record high, whilst 2yr Treasury yields (-7.7bps) saw their best day in two months. However, that momentum behind risk assets has been lost overnight, as disappointing results from Oracle after the US close pushed their shares down -11.52% in after-hours trading. And in turn, S&P 500 futures are down -0.90% this morning, with those on the NASDAQ 100 down -1.20%. So even as investors were reassured by the Fed\u2019s latest rate cut, familiar concerns about AI are still very much top of mind right now.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the Fed decision, the FOMC delivered a third consecutive cut that took the target range for the fed funds rate down to 3.50-3.75%. This was a 9-3 decision, with Governor Miran again advocating for a larger 50bp cut, whereas regional Fed presidents Goolsbee and Schmid favoured no change. The cut was accompanied by implicit signals that the Fed could remain on hold in early 2026. For instance, the dot plot showed the median participant only expecting one more rate cut in 2026, while new wording on \u201cthe extent and timing\u201d of further rate adjustments signaled a possible pause ahead. Powell also emphasised that the FOMC was \u201cwell positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves\u201d as recent easing had brought the policy stance \u201cwithin a broad range of estimates of neutral\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>However, this cautious guidance was accompanied by several dovish-leaning elements. Notably, the updated economic projections struck a sanguine tone, with real GDP revised higher across the 2025-27 period, whilst 2026 headline and core PCE inflation were revised -0.1pp and -0.2pp lower to 2.4% and 2.5% respectively. The statement also dialed up the tone on the recent uptick in unemployment while Powell sounded a bit more sanguine on upside inflation risks, saying that \u201cinflation has come in a touch lower\u201d recently and that \u201cmost of the inflation overshoot is from tariffs\u201d. Our US economists\u2019 base case remains that Powell has now delivered the last rate cut of his tenure as chair, but continued labor market weakness could swing the FOMC to cut again in the next few months (see their full reaction note here).<br />\nAway from rates policy, the Fed also announced they\u2019ll begin reserve-management purchases of Treasury bills. Those will start at $40bn a month from next week and are expected to \u201cremain elevated for a few months\u201d before slowing significantly after the April tax payment window. This will mark the first sustained increase in the size of the Fed balance sheet since the Fed ended QE in spring 2022. And it was a slight surprise this was announced at yesterday\u2019s meeting, even if a shift towards more active liquidity management had been expected by early 2026.</p>\n\n<p>After the decision, markets saw the FOMC\u2019s signal as favourable to expectations of a 2026 rate cut. So even though a rate cut is only priced at 20% by the next meeting in late-January, futures currently signal a 52% chance of a cut by March as we go to press this morning. Moreover, there was a dovish shift in the futures curve, with the rate priced by the December meeting down -6.6bps on the day, meaning that 55bps of cuts were priced for next year by the close. In turn, that meant 2yr Treasury yields fell by 5 to 6bps intraday after the FOMC to register their biggest daily decline in two months (-7.7bps to 3.54%), and 10yr yields fell by -4.1bps on the day to 4.15%. That trend has continued overnight as well, with the 10yr yield down another -2.1bps to 4.13%. And this also weighed on the dollar index, which fell -0.44% yesterday to a six-week low.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Fed\u2019s decision helped to support equities, with the S&P 500 (+0.67%) closing just -0.06% below its all-time high, it\u2019s been a very different story overnight following Oracle\u2019s earnings. They reported after the US close, but their revenues fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates, with their share price down -11.52% in after-hours trading. So that\u2019s pushed US equity futures lower this morning, with those on the S&P 500 down -0.90%, whilst those on the NASDAQ 100 have fallen -1.20%.</p>\n\n<p>That more negative trend has continued in Asia overnight, where there\u2019ve been losses across the major indices. So the Nikkei (-0.97%), the Shanghai Comp (-0.75%), the CSI 300 (-0.52%), the Hang Seng (-0.22%) and the KOSPI (-0.20%) are all lower this morning. And those losses have been particularly sharp for tech stocks, with the Hang Seng Tech index down -1.12%. Bond yields have also moved lower, which partly reflects the Fed and the wider risk-off tone this morning, but we also saw Japan\u2019s 20yr auction have its strongest demand since 2020. Moreover, the latest employment data from Australia showed an unexpected contraction of -21.3k in November (vs. +20.0k expected), which has raised doubts about the likelihood of a near-term rate hike by the RBA. Indeed, yields on 10yr Australian government bonds are down -8.9bps this morning, and the Australian dollar is the worst-performing G10 currency, down -0.59% against the US dollar.</p>\n\n<p>Before the Fed and Oracle\u2019s earnings, investors had priced in a growing chance of an ECB rate hike for 2026, which is now seen as a 40% chance. That gave the European bond selloff a fresh dose of momentum, which was particularly clear at the front end of the curve. For instance, the 2yr German yield (+2.2bps) rose to 2.17%, its highest level since the fiscal stimulus announcements were made in March. And that was echoed across the continent, with yields on 2yr French (+2.4bps) and Italian (+1.6bps) debt also at their highest in months. However, the long-end was more subdued, with yields on 10yr bunds (+0.1bps), OATs (+1.2bps) and BTPs (+0.3bps) seeing smaller increases that still left them beneath their closing level on Monday. In the meantime, equities saw a relatively stronger performance, with the STOXX 600 (+0.07%) inching up after three consecutive declines.</p>\n\n<p>On the theme of central banks, yesterday also brought the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision, who held their policy rate at 2.25% as expected. This followed rate cuts at the previous two meetings, but this time their statement said that if the economy and inflation evolved in line with their October projections, then they felt rates were \u201cat about the right level\u201d. In turn, Canadian government bond yields fell back, with the 2yr yield down -6.0bps on the day, whilst the 10yr fell -4.4bps.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there wasn\u2019t too much data yesterday, although we did get the Employment Cost Index (ECI) from the US for Q3. That came in a bit softer than expected at +0.8% (vs. +0.9% expected), and it was also the slowest pace since Q3 last year. So that helped to ease fears about inflationary pressures, particularly with the year-on-year pace now down to +3.5%, the slowest since Q2 2021.</p>\n\n<p>To the day ahead now, and data releases include the US weekly initial jobless claims, along with the trade balance for September. Otherwise from central banks, we\u2019ll hear from BoE Governor Bailey.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T13:39:41+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Thu, 12/11/2025 - 08:39</span>\n",

We are nearing that point,\" Will Marshall, CEO of satellite operator and builder Planet Labs, told WSJ.</p>\n\n<p>Making spaceflight affordable has been SpaceX's focus with its reusable rockets, and once Starship becomes commercialized, costs should drop even further.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/Gz8kcFKWgAA78_F.jpg?itok=JY9cj0yU\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Gz8kcFKWgAA78_F.jpg?itok=JY9cj0yU\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"27f4603b-e275-4e0c-ad7e-f08c22157d53\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"310\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Gz8kcFKWgAA78_F.jpg?itok=JY9cj0yU\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Let's remind readers that SpaceX is effectively America's rocket program - and it leads the world by light-years.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/2025-12-10_06-51-39.png?itok=2zbJiyDS\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-12-10_06-51-39.png?itok=2zbJiyDS\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8d060886-6f22-4903-808f-03cac5a4656b\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"429\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-12-10_06-51-39.png?itok=2zbJiyDS\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>This makes Musk and xAI uniquely positioned to scale data centers quickly.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX also leads in terms of spacecraft upmass...</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/2025-12-10_06-52-50.png?itok=87BGd5QO\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/2025-12-10_06-52-50.png?itok=87BGd5QO\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"e61bec9d-63dd-40d2-97f4-69e28b0cc267\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"479\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/2025-12-10_06-52-50.png?itok=87BGd5QO\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>WSJ noted that Google and Planet Labs plan to conduct a 2027 space test using satellites equipped with Google AI chips.

Most participants had a BMI of 35 or higher.</p>\n\n<p>Result highlights for both high-dose regimens (9 mg and 12 mg):</p>\n\n<ul><li>\n\t<p><em>Met all primary and key secondary endpoints</em></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong><em>Produced massive weight loss: up to 28.7% on average (71.2 lbs) at 68 weeks</em></strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><em>Delivered major pain improvement: up to 4.5 points (75.8%) reduction on the WOMAC pain score</em></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><em>Improved physical function, in addition to weight and pain outcomes</em></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><p>\"We are encouraged by the results of TRIUMPH-4, which highlight the powerful effect of retatrutide, a first-in-class triple agonist, on body weight, pain and physical function. <strong>With seven additional Phase 3 readouts expected in 2026, we believe retatrutide could become an important option for patients with significant weight loss needs and certain complications, including knee osteoarthritis</strong>,\" Kenneth Custer, Ph.D., executive vice president and president, Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, wrote in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>Some patients lost so much weight they chose to exit the trial early, particularly those with a BMI below 35. The <strong>highest dose saw an 18% dropout rate due to side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and occasional mild dysesthesia</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Not all patients may need this potentially very high level of efficacy, and we believe retatrutide will likely be best suited for patients with a very high BMI, or with obesity-related complications that require a high degree of weight loss,\" Lilly's Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky told investors in October.</p>\n\n<p>The results come as the <strong>race for next-generation obesity drugs intensifies</strong>: Shares of rival Novo Nordisk plummeted the most on record after an experimental GLP-1 fell short of Wall Street expectations last year. The drug CagriSema helped patients lose an average of 20.4% of their weight, far short of Novo's promise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stock Chart: Lilly vs. Novo</strong></p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/Snag_22b596f.png?itok=KFrDHSJZ\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Snag_22b596f.png?itok=KFrDHSJZ\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"236a8abb-34f0-4a4f-8aef-06d4d89c3a7f\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"277\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Snag_22b596f.png?itok=KFrDHSJZ\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p><em>Is Goldman still putting their clients in Novo?</em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T13:05:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Thu, 12/11/2025 - 08:05</span>\n",

Beginning this week, a new rule issued by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) will force securities firms to vet, supervise and assume legal responsibility for content produced by influencers they pay, <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/asean-money/indonesia-s-finfluencers-under-scrutiny-as-p2p-lending-bubble-bursts?utm_campaign=GL_asia_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_source=NA_newsletter&utm_content=article_link&del_type=1&pub_date=202512091230000900&seq_num=4&si=79447\">according to Nikkei</a>.</p>\n\n<p data-end=\"890\" data-start=\"86\">Influencers who analyze investments must be licensed advisers, while those promoting products must register as marketing partners and clearly disclose paid endorsements. They will also be required to explain risks, not just potential returns. As the OJK cautioned in an October campaign, \u201cThe next time a piece of financial advice blows up on your feed, take a pause. Just because it\u2019s viral doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s sound.\u201d</p>\n\n<p data-end=\"1483\" data-start=\"892\">The crackdown coincides with mounting complaints against peer-to-peer lending (P2P) apps once hyped by finfluencers. Akseleran, one of the country\u2019s most recognizable platforms, is being sued by at least 19 investors who say they collectively lost around 6 billion rupiah. The company attributes its problems to borrowers defaulting en masse. Several other platforms, including KoinP2P, Crowde and Dana Syariah Indonesia, are under similar scrutiny. The OJK recently revoked Crowde\u2019s license and is coordinating with police to investigate potential criminal activity tied to other platforms.</p>\n\n<p data-end=\"1483\" data-start=\"892\"><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.23.54.jpg?itok=opbmFTxQ\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.23.54.jpg?itok=opbmFTxQ\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0b058041-fb75-4766-bc4e-bcdc7174fca6\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"255\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.23.54.jpg?itok=opbmFTxQ\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p data-end=\"1956\" data-start=\"1485\">Nikkei <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/asean-money/indonesia-s-finfluencers-under-scrutiny-as-p2p-lending-bubble-bursts?utm_campaign=GL_asia_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_source=NA_newsletter&utm_content=article_link&del_type=1&pub_date=202512091230000900&seq_num=4&si=79447\">writes</a> that one casualty of that boom-and-bust cycle is 29-year-old Surabaya resident Anita Carolina. Three years ago she was persuaded by a financial influencer to invest 471 million rupiah (about $28,000) in Akseleran. Today she is still trying to recover the money. The experience, she says, changed the way she invests. \u201cInvesting should not be marketed as a casual game. Influencers are salespeople, not financial advisers,\u201d she said, adding that she now avoids them \u201centirely.\u201d</p>\n\n<p data-end=\"2599\" data-start=\"1958\">Carolina\u2019s story reflects a broader shift in Indonesia\u2019s financial landscape. Investor participation has exploded, climbing from 2.5 million registered participants in 2019 to 19.2 million in October 2024, fueled by easy-to-use apps and pandemic-era interest in alternative income. Many new retail investors \u2014 dominated by millennials and Gen Z \u2014 chased high returns through stocks, crypto and P2P lending, often guided not by licensed professionals but by relatable personalities on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. A 2023 CELIOS survey found that 70% of Indonesians trust finfluencers, nearly equal to the 69.5% who trust certified advisers.</p>\n\n<p data-end=\"3182\" data-start=\"2601\">Experts say that reliance has created a fertile market for unqualified \u201cadvisers\u201d who blur the line between education and marketing. \u201cIt has become easy for individuals to label themselves as finfluencers without a proper background,\u201d said economist Tauhid Ahmad. Many fail to disclose paid partnerships, while others promote products they barely understand. Regulators have also struggled to keep up: from 2017 to September 2024, the OJK says it blocked over 13,000 illegal financial entities, most involving online loans or investment schemes that quickly resurface in new forms.</p>\n\n<p data-end=\"3182\" data-start=\"2601\"><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.24.09.jpg?itok=bf1Oxwv1\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.24.09.jpg?itok=bf1Oxwv1\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"470e0b65-af44-4a19-9158-8613ff49d814\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"293\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Screenshot%202025-12-10%20at%2009.24.09.jpg?itok=bf1Oxwv1\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p data-end=\"3878\" data-start=\"3184\">Some influencers now admit their own role in fueling unsustainable P2P enthusiasm. TikTok creator Felicia Putri Tjiasaka, who has 1.4 million followers, said she also invested in Akseleran but exited in 2023. \u201cIn Indonesia, it\u2019s the productive P2P sector that is failing,\u201d she told her followers, citing economic pressures and lax credit screening.</p>\n\n<p data-end=\"3878\" data-start=\"3184\">Others argue regulations are long overdue. Educator and influencer Roy Shakti says untrained personalities are \u201cpositioning themselves as experts to teach trading,\u201d and supports measures similar to China\u2019s ban on wealth-flaunting. \u201cYou won\u2019t find me promising easy money,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, I teach people how to raise funding and avoid scams.\u201d</p>\n\n<p data-end=\"4107\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\" data-start=\"3880\">Though she continues to invest in mutual funds and bitcoin, Carolina now conducts her own research before committing a single rupiah. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, as I followed their advice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now, I avoid them entirely.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T10:45:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Thu, 12/11/2025 - 05:45</span>\n",

Backed by the Free Speech Union, he\u2019s now fighting back against this blatant overreach that reeks of leftist intolerance for inconvenient truths.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Teacher banned after telling Muslim child that Britain is Christian country <a href=\"https://t.co/P4jEdY0irl\">https://t.co/P4jEdY0irl</a></p>\n\u2014 The Free Speech Union (@SpeechUnion) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeechUnion/status/1998374786771427533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The incident kicked off when the teacher caught students washing their feet in the boys\u2019 bathroom sinks\u2014a clear violation at the non-faith school where prayers were confined to a designated room. According to reports, he addressed the group, explaining the rules and emphasizing British values of tolerance.</p>\n\n<p>But one pupil took offense, claiming the teacher said the school wasn\u2019t religious and suggested an alternative. Specifically, the child reported the teacher stating, \u201cBritain is still a Christian state,\u201d while noting the King\u2019s role as head of the Church of England. The educator also allegedly remarked, \u201cif you want that, there\u2019s an Islamic school a mile away,\u201d referring to accommodations for Islamic practices.</p>\n\n<p>Police from the Metropolitan\u2019s child abuse team got involved, probing a potential hate crime. Though that inquiry was dropped, the local safeguarding board branded the teacher\u2019s comments as causing \u201cemotional harm\u201d to the child, leading to his ban from the profession.</p>\n\n<p>The school wasted no time: suspended in March 2024, sacked for gross misconduct by February 2025 after nearly three years on the job.</p>\n\n<p>With the aid of the Free Speech Union, the teacher is now suing the local authority. Lord Toby Young, the group\u2019s director, remarked, \u201cThis teacher lost his job and almost ended up being barred from the profession for life just because he pointed out to a class of Muslim schoolchildren that the national religion of England is Anglicanism.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He drove the point home: \u201cThings have reached a pretty pass in this country if a teacher can be branded a safeguarding risk because he says something that\u2019s incontestably true. If he\u2019d claimed that Islam is the official religion of England, even though that\u2019s not true, I doubt he would have got into any trouble.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Young\u2019s critique highlights the double standard plaguing Britain\u2019s institutions, where affirming the majority culture invites punishment, but pushing minority agendas gets a free pass.</p>\n\n<p>The teacher successfully appealed the ban and now works part-time at another school outside London. Yet the damage is done\u2014his career derailed over a factual statement in a lesson on tolerance, no less.</p>\n\n<p>This fiasco echoes broader concerns that safeguarding protocols are being hijacked to target conservative views. Just days prior, an ex-Royal Marine faced a similar ban for online posts criticizing illegal immigration, as <a href=\"https://dailysceptic.org/2025/12/08/right-wingers-branded-danger-to-children/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">noted in related coverage</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">A jury took just 17 minutes to unanimously clear Royal Marine veteran, Jamie Michael, of stirring up racial hatred after he was arrested for a posting a video about illegal immigration.<br /><br />\nDespite their verdict, Jamie has been banned from working with children.

But facts didn\u2019t matter to the ideologues who prioritized feelings over reality.</p>\n\n<p>In a nation where Christianity shaped laws, holidays, and institutions for centuries, stating the obvious now risks professional ruin.</p>\n\n<p>Britain\u2019s slide into this woke dystopia serves as a stark warning. If bureaucrats are allowed to redefine \u201charm\u201d to include historical facts, then free expression crumbles. The teacher\u2019s fightback offers hope, but it underscores the urgent need to dismantle these speech-suppressing mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p><em>Your support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

    "full_content": "The \u201cTrump Gold Card\u201d will generate billions of dollars for the federal government, but will not expand the huge inflow of migrants into the careers sought by skilled American graduates, says Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\n\u201cThe program is part of the already approved visas,\u201d Lutnick told a reporter during a White House press event, adding:\n\nThe average green card holder earns less than the average American. So they were more likely to be on the dole and be on our assistance programs than average Americans. The idea is from President Trump, he wants to raise it, bring the best people into America. So same visas, but now just full of the best people.\n\nThe fast-track ticket to citizenship can be bought by vetted individuals for $1 million or purchased by a company for $2 million. The company can reuse the ticket for a different person every five years.\n\nTrump touted his sale of citizenship by saying it would raise funds for the government, as well as provide specific foreign workers sought by Fortune 500 companies. \u201cThe companies will be very happy, and I know Apple will be very happy,\u201d Trump said, adding:\n\nPeople are just buying them, somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card: Companies are going to be able to go to the Wharton School of Finance, Harvard, MIT, wherever you may get your [foreign] students, any school, and you\u2019re able to buy the card and keep that person in the United States, actually, so there\u2019s certainty, because a lot of I\u2019ve heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I\u2019ve heard from a lot of people, [including] some of the [technology exectives] at this table that essentially, in the United States, you can\u2019t keep the [foreign] student. You can\u2019t hire [foreign] people from the best colleges, because \u2026 you could say there\u2019s no way of guaranteeing that they\u2019re able to stay in the country.\n\nHowever, employers already have multiple ways to hire foreigners who graduate from U.S. universities.\n\nFor example, roughly 400,00 foreign students and graduates are already being allowed to stay and work in the United States for one to three years. That work-permit program is dubbed the Occupational Practical Training program, and is widely used by foreign managers to hire ethnic peers for careers, so excluding a large number of American graduates from professional careers.\n\nMany of those OPT workers subsequently get picked for the H-1B program, which annually grants new long-term work visas to 120,000 foreign graduates each year. After several more years, H-1B workers can get green cards.\n\nThe OPT program was created by George W. Bush\u2019s deputies, without approval from Congress.\n\nIn September, Trump signed a proclamation slamming the visa programs that keep roughly 2.5 million foreign graduates in jobs needed by American professionals.\n\nThe voter reaction to the announcement was mixed:\n\n\u201cWe want the invaders out, not in,\u201d said Rickey Halliday.\n\n\u201cPlease tell me how this is America First? How is selling citizenship to foreigners good for our country and culture? \u201d asked Kelly McCarty. \u201cAmerican citizenship shouldn\u2019t be something that goes to the highest bidder.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery quote and comment is telling you this is bad,\u201d said Nanomax.\n\nA White House statement says the gold card is legal because the buyers are classified as candidates for the existing EB-1 or EB-2 pathway. The pathways are part of the \u201cEmployment-Based\u201d route, which allocates 140,000 green cards to migrants nominated by employers each year.\n\nRELATED: Vance \u2014 Securing America\u2019s Borders Is the \u2018Humanitarian Thing to Do for the Entire World\u2019\n\n\u201cA $1 million gift upon completion of the individual\u2019s vetting is evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States,\u201d says the gold card website.\n\nThe EB-1 pathway is for \u201cAliens with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics; Outstanding professors and researchers; or Certain multinational managers and executives.\u201d The EB-2 route is for migrants \u201cwho are members of the professions holding advanced degrees or who have exceptional ability.\u201d\n\nBoth routes are backlogged by Indian visa-workers who claim to be high-powered managers or gifted workers. For example, in August 2024, Breitbart News described one migrant who boasted that he had hired Indian contractors to embellish his claimed academic resume:\n\nThe way this works is that they interview you to learn the key things you\u2019ve done and record it, draft an article from your interview, ask you to do a final review and edits, and then work with various publications to get your article published. They\u2019re fairly expensive and charge $3500 for 1 article, $6700 for 2 and $9600 for 3. They\u2019re also quite slow \u2014 I decided to use them in mid-December and the articles came out in May and June, 6-7 months later.\n\nStill, the EB-1 and EB-2 pathways are far quicker than the EB-3 pathway.\n\nThe EB-3 pathway is allocated to ordinary visa workers, such as the vast majority of H-1B, H4EAD, L-1, and -1 visa workers now being imported to fill jobs that would otherwise go to young and mid-career Americans. Many of the ordinary visa workers willingly pay kickbacks to get starter jobs in the United States. This willingness to pay kickbacks ensures that many executives have a personal economic incentive to fire productive American professionals so their jobs can be sold to Indian migrants, often via a series of well-organized brokers and subcontractors.\n\nThe card plan faces additional pitfalls.\n\nThe Trump Gold Card is likely to trigger lawsuits by lawyers who are paid to guide migrants through the EB-1 and EB-2 pathways. It is also likely to be used by the many companies that are paid to help migrants by green cards via the EB-5 pathway, which offers 10,000 cards per year. The EB-5 cards are given to migrants who lend roughly $1 million to companies, typically to real estate investors.\n\nThe number of gold cards to be sold may be reduced by the existence of the rival paths, including the OPT-to-H-1B and EB-5 routes.\n\nAlso, there is a floating cap on the number of green cards that can be awarded to migrants from each nation per year. Those country caps keep any Indian applicants in line for roughly 10 years, regardless of the Trump Gold Card status.\n\n\u201cThe administration can\u2019t replace or bypass the normal immigration system,\u201d said a tweet from U.S. Tech Workers, which champions American professionals. Would-be migrants \u201cend up with two parallel tracks offering identical outcomes, except one charges a massive fee for no added benefit.\u201d",

Julia Coleman told Fox News Digital. \"I have a bill that mandates state employees to report fraud if they know of it to law enforcement, but Democrats have blocked us every step of the way.\"</p><p>Republican state Sen. Michael Kreun told Fox News Digital that Republicans will put forward measures to crack down on fraud during the next legislative session early next year.</p><p>\"There's going to be a number of bills coming up here in the next legislative session to address fraud,\" Kreun said. \"The one that I've been working on this past year was a bill to establish a statewide office of inspector general, which would be an independent office not that wouldn't direct directly answer to the governor, whose sole mission would be to root out fraud, investigate fraud, with all providers and recipients across all state agencies and to be overlooking the agencies themselves.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/he-had-years-to-stop-this-gop-lawmakers-blast-walz-over-massive-minnesota-fraud-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>\u2018HE HAD YEARS TO STOP THIS\u2019: GOP LAWMAKERS BLAST WALZ OVER MASSIVE MINNESOTA FRAUD SCHEME</strong></a></p><p>Kreun blamed Walz for his legislation stalling in the Democrat-controlled House earlier this year, a sentiment echoed by state Rep. Patti Anderson, who <a href=\"https://x.com/pattiandersonmn/status/1993105952447619301?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">wrote on X</a>, \"Speaker Demuth tried to get the OIG bill passed in the House but the House Dems killed it due to pressure from Governor Walz. We all know that\u2019s true. Let\u2019s hope House Dems finally see the light and we get it done next year.\"</p><p>Walz's office directed Fox News Digital to a clip of Demuth saying in a press conference last week that Walz previously stated \"he would sign it\" if the bill got to his desk.\u00a0</p><p>\"So that's one measure that we can take next year,\" Kreun said. \"There's gonna be a whole host of other measures to put up those guardrails to make sure that it becomes a lot harder to commit fraud here in Minnesota.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minneapolis</a> has been at the center of controversy in recent weeks over a massive fraud scheme dating back to at least 2020 that permeated several departments and several nonprofits, ranging from childcare services, to COVID-19 relief, to autism care. It is believed by many to eventually eclipse $1 billion in wasted state and federal taxpayer funds.\u00a0</p><p>The most prominent scandal, related to the nonprofit Feeding Our Future and representing the nation's largest <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">COVID-19</a> fraud case, involves a\u00a0scheme that prosecutors say exploited a federally funded children\u2019s nutrition program administered by the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, siphoning money meant to provide meals to low-income kids.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elon-musk-accuses-ilhan-omar-treason-over-somalia-comments-viral-social-media-post\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ELON MUSK ACCUSES ILHAN OMAR OF TREASON OVER SOMALIA COMMENTS IN VIRAL SOCIAL MEDIA POST</strong></a></p><p>\"For this amount of fraud to take place in the state of Minnesota, a billion or more dollars of fraud to happen has to be apathy and incompetence,\" GOP state Sen. Julia Coleman told Fox News Digital.\u00a0</p><p>\"Years ago, before this ever hit the national media stage, I sat on an education committee trying to get to the bottom of how the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal happened. Now, this was years ago. There have been no additional guardrails in place, and in fact, fraud has been allowed to be more rampant than ever. It's a mix of apathy and incompetence. Republicans have proposed a number of common sense guardrails. I have a bill that mandates state employees to report fraud if they know of it to law enforcement, but Democrats have blocked us every step of the way.\"</p><p>GOP state Sen. Mark Koran told Fox News Digital that while legislation will help, ultimately, the oversight in Minnesota is done by the executive branch.</p><p><i>\"</i>It's not gonna change with this governor,\" Koran said.\u00a0</p><p>Fox News Digital also spoke to former federal prosector Joe Teirab, who worked on the Feeding Our Future case, and asked him what changes need to be made to ensure this large-scale fraud doesn't happen again.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think you need to look at all these big government programs where tons of money is going out, and especially the ones in which nonprofits or other organizations are just entrusted to be watchdogs themselves,\" Teirab explained. \"That's just not a system that's set up well. Those things need we need to have way more checks and balances, way more structure to make sure that that money's going out to the right people and it's actually being used in the way that it should be used and then we need to give more teeth and more ability for auditors and inspector generals to actually say, hey, look, if someone is potentially committing fraud, that person, the money should be cut off from them in other aspects of other agencies.\"</p><p>Minnesota\u2019s Legislature is narrowly divided, with Democrats holding a one-seat majority in the Senate (34\u201333) and a larger but still closely watched majority in the House (70\u201364). The razor-thin margin in the Senate means a single defection can derail major legislation, while the House majority gives Democrats control of the agenda but not much room for controversial or partisan bills to lose support.</p><p>\"Ultimately, we need to figure out the depth of this problem, get it taken care of once and for all, get the right people in place,\" Kreun told Fox News Digital. \"A change in the administration would go a long way towards helping that, and then rebuilding that trust with proper safeguards and people that are looking out for the taxpayer and make sure that they're not getting ripped off.\"</p>",

The man walked around the desk, pointed the gun at the judge and repeatedly shot him. Stines has been charged with first-degree murder and murder of a public official.</p><p>The admission comes as the former sheriff's attorneys have worked to establish that Stines was suffering from \"extreme emotional disturbance\" prior to the shooting, suggesting his legal team is preparing a broad insanity defense, the outlet reported.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/kentucky-judge-killed-chambers-accused-trading-sexual-favors-influence-wild-parties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>KENTUCKY JUDGE KILLED IN CHAMBERS ACCUSED OF TRADING SEXUAL FAVORS FOR INFLUENCE AT WILD PARTIES</strong></a></p><p>In a document written a few days after the shooting, a social worker who met with Stines in jail said he had remained in \"an active state of psychosis\" and didn\u2019t appear to understand the criminal charge against him. Stines had \"episodes of combativeness which has required pepper spray,\" The Associated Press reported.</p><p>In a deposition Stines gave investigators in the days leading up to the shooting, he claimed to have been suffering from dizziness, headaches, sweating and memory loss brought on by <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">California encephalitis</a>, a neurological disease resulting from bug bites, the Herald-Leader reported.\u00a0</p><p>Prosecutors have not commented on the latest filings. Stines' legal team has argued that a portion of his mental evaluation should remain sealed, a position that the judge recently upheld.</p><p>Stines resigned as sheriff days after the shooting and is being held without bond in eastern Kentucky.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/ex-sheriff-accused-shooting-judge-chambers-says-state-skirted-law-should-toss-murder-case-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>EX-SHERIFF ACCUSED OF SHOOTING JUDGE IN CHAMBERS SAYS STATE SKIRTED LAW, SHOULD TOSS MURDER CASE: REPORT</u></strong></a></p><p>Under Kentucky law, proof of mental incapacitation or extreme emotional distress could take the death penalty off the table in Stines\u2019 case, the Herald-Leader reported. However, a defendant\u2019s standards of intent reportedly differ in civil cases, with Mullins\u2019 widow filing a wrongful death lawsuit against Stines and three other Letcher County Sheriff\u2019s Office employees in September.\u00a0</p><p>Kimberly Mullins and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-sheriffs-wife-daughter-deny-any-contact-judge-he-allegedly-murdered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the couple\u2019s two children</a> are reportedly accusing Stines of assault and battery, while alleging that three other sheriff\u2019s employees did not warn or protect the judge from Stines, who was showing signs of being anxious, violently paranoid and psychotic.\u00a0</p><p>On Nov. 12, Stines admitted to shooting Mullins in his answer to the civil lawsuit, adding that he was \"exhibiting paranoid and psychotic conduct,\" according to the Herald-Leader.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/victims-outraged-after-ohio-judge-releases-repeat-attacker-targeting-random-men\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><u>VICTIMS OUTRAGED AFTER OHIO JUDGE RELEASES MAN CHARGED IN MULTIPLE CLEVELAND ASSAULTS</u></strong></a></p><p>Stines' attorneys reportedly moved to dismiss the case under the sovereign immunity doctrine, which shields government officials from civil liability claims while acting in their official capacity. They also asked a judge to dismiss the negligence claims against him, citing the accusation must show proof of intent.\u00a0</p><p>\"As Sheriff, he was a county employee and, therefore, is entitled to the same sovereign immunity granted to the County itself,\" his attorneys wrote, according to the Herald-Leader. \"Based on this, the official capacity claims against Shawn Stines must be dismissed.\"</p><p>Additionally, Stines\u2019 attorneys reportedly detailed a possible defense they could use to portray their client\u2019s state of mind during the alleged killing, insisting that he \"had no control,\" and was suffering from \"pre-existing conditions.\"\u00a0</p><p>Stines' attorneys did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\u00a0</p><p>Last week, a judge reportedly denied two <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">motions to dismiss the criminal charges</a> against Stines, with his attorneys saying prosecutors never informed the grand jury of their client\u2019s mental state when the crime was committed and that the proceeding was intentionally not recorded.\u00a0</p>",

That fact is undisputed.

Since then, much of the case has unfolded behind closed doors, prompting a coalition of media organizations, including Fox News, to demand greater transparency.\u00a0</p><p>That coalition requested that prosecutors and defense attorneys be required to give advance notice whenever they seek to seal filings or restrict public access so that those limits can be challenged before taking effect.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/erika-kirk-pushes-back-online-conspiracy-theories-about-husbands-death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ERIKA KIRK PUSHES BACK AT ONLINE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT HUSBAND'S DEATH</strong></a></p><p>Legal analyst and California-based trial attorney Roger Bonakdar said the dramatic shift in transparency has been striking from the start.\u00a0</p><p>\"It has been pretty odd that the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">information tap was at full blast</a> for a little while and now it's completely shut off,\" he said. \"It's really kind of inconsistent with how you see cases move forward typically.\"</p><p>Bonakdar said authorities were unusually forthcoming early in the investigation, releasing details that prosecutors typically hold back.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/erika-kirk-rejects-argument-gun-violence-root-problem-led-charlies-assassination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ERIKA KIRK REJECTS ARGUMENT GUN VIOLENCE WAS THE ROOT PROBLEM THAT LED TO CHARLIE'S ASSASSINATION</strong></a></p><p>\"When they first arrested Tyler Robinson, the information tap was at full blast,\" he said. \"They told us that they had audio recordings from Tyler Robinson and a purported confession.

If the hearing transitions into a closed session, the media coalition\u2019s attorney may remain in the courtroom but may not share any portion of the sealed discussion with any outlet or client.</p><p>The court has also imposed strict guidelines <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tyler-robinson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on how Robinson</a> may be shown. He cannot be photographed or filmed in shackles and may only be depicted while seated. Images of his family members are prohibited, and reporters must comply with the court\u2019s decorum order.</p><p>These restrictions mirror earlier rulings, including the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/charlie-kirk-suspected-assassin-will-not-show-face-court-key-hearing-postponed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">postponement of a prior hearing</a> after disputes over whether Robinson could appear in jail attire and how that might influence public perception.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/accused-charlie-kirk-assassin-wants-ditch-jail-clothes-upcoming-court-appearances\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ACCUSED CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSIN WANTS TO DITCH JAIL CLOTHES FOR UPCOMING COURT APPEARANCES</strong></a></p><p>Bonakdar said such concerns are rooted in fairness.\u00a0</p><p>\"Courts oftentimes will prohibit the media from depicting the defendant in shackles or in jail clothing because it creates this inference of guilt,\" he explained.\u00a0</p><p>Appearing restrained, he said, can lead jurors to view a defendant as dangerous or guilty before any evidence is presented. Still, he noted the restrictions may have limited impact in such a widely covered case.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/prosecutors-plan-dirty-up-kirk-suspect-tyler-robinson-sway-jury-toward-death-penalty-fmr-us-atty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>PROSECUTORS PLAN TO 'DIRTY UP' KIRK SUSPECT TYLER ROBINSON TO SWAY JURY TOWARD DEATH PENALTY: FMR US ATTY</strong></a></p><p>\"Anybody who does a Google search will know\u2026 at some point it may be an exercise in futility. Is the damage already done?\"</p><p>Robinson\u2019s limited physical appearances have raised questions as well. Bonakdar said the most likely explanation for keeping him on video is security.\u00a0</p><p>\"They're gonna say that Tyler Robinson is a security risk\u2026 he's at risk for being hit by someone who wants to seek revenge,\" he said. While he acknowledged the reasoning, he added that it is \"very clearly a deviation from the norm.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/erika-kirk-recalls-last-moments-charlie-before-his-horror-movie-murder-addresses-assassination-video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ERIKA KIRK RECALLS LAST MOMENTS WITH CHARLIE BEFORE HIS 'HORROR MOVIE' MURDER, ADDRESSES ASSASSINATION VIDEO</strong></a></p><p><strong>WATCH: Street clothes at center of Tyler Robinson court case</strong></p><p>Despite public frustration with the pace of the case, Bonakdar said the timeline is typical for a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homicide case,</a> particularly one in which prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty.</p><p>\"The timing of the case is actually very consistent with the severity of the allegation,\" he said.

Green has introduced articles of impeachment against Trump at least five times this year, but he has not before tried to force a vote on the issue.</p><p>Green's impeachment filing accuses Trump of \"calling for the execution of six Democratic lawmakers\" and of making threats of violence against judges. The former refers to Trump's reaction after Democratic lawmakers urged members of the military to \"refuse illegal orders.\"</p><p>\"President Trump is an abuser of presidential power who, if left in office, will continue to promote violence, engender invidious hate, undermine our democracy, and dissolve our Republic,\" Green said in a statement.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-urge-military-members-refuse-illegal-orders-viral-video-hegseth-responds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SIX DEMOCRATS URGE MILITARY MEMBERS TO 'REFUSE ILLEGAL ORDERS' IN VIRAL VIDEO; HEGSETH RESPONDS</strong></a></p><p>Green has failed several times to gather support among Democrats for impeaching Trump. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/democrats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">House Democrats</a> voted to kill a Green impeachment effort in June, that one based on Trump ordering airstrikes on Iran.</p><p>Trump is not the only member of his administration to face impeachment efforts, however.

    "content": "\n<p>Our studio, LucasFonts, designed Calibri. Here are our CEO Luc(as) de Groot\u2019s thoughts on the matter:<p>The decision to abandon Calibri on the grounds of it being a so-called \u201cwasteful diversity font\u201d is both amusing and regrettable. Calibri was specifically designed to enhance readability on modern computer screens and was selected by Microsoft in 2007 to replace Times New Roman as the default font in the Office suite. There were sound reasons for moving away from Times: Calibri performs exceptionally well at small sizes and on standard office monitors, whereas serif fonts like Times New Roman tend to appear more distorted. While serif fonts are well-suited to high-resolution displays, such as those found on modern smartphones, on typical office screens the serifs introduce unnecessary visual noise and can be particularly problematic for users with impaired vision, such as older adults.<p>Professional typography can be achieved with both serif and sans-serif fonts. However, Times New Roman\u2014a typeface older than the current president\u2014presents unique challenges. Originally crafted in Great Britain for newspaper printing, Times was optimised for paper, with each letterform meticulously cut and tested for specific sizes. In the digital era, larger size drawings were repurposed as models, resulting in a typeface that appears too thin and sharp when printed at high quality.<p>Serif fonts are often perceived as more traditional, but they are also more demanding to use effectively. While a skilled typographer can, in theory, produce excellent results with Times, using it in its default digital form is not considered professional practice.<p>Calibri, by contrast, incorporates extensive spacing adjustments and language-specific refinements. The digital version of Times New Roman, developed in the early days of computing, offers only minimal kerning and letter-pair adjustments. This is especially evident in words set in all capitals\u2014such as \u201cCHICAGO\u201d\u2014where the spacing is inconsistent: the letters \u201cHIC\u201d are tightly packed, while \u201cCAG\u201d are spaced too far apart. Microsoft cannot rectify these issues without altering the appearance of existing documents.</p>\n",

As always, please bear in mind that these are power \\*rankings\\* rather than standings. So you may see one team be listed above another with a better record or even one they\u2019ve already lost to head-to-head at some point \u2013 the objective is to weigh them against the rest of the league at large, and how many opponents I\u2019d favor them over. Especially, as playoff seedings are starting to materialize, we\u2019re somewhat looking ahead at who can go the distance, even though this is more meant to be a snapshot of this moment.\n\nI took injuries into account and weighed current form more heavily, while compared to earlier in the season, we have a pretty good picture of what teams are in all three facets of the game. Although you\u2019ll find a variety of statistics and advanced\u00a0metrics to support my arguments, they\u2019re all primarily grounded in having watched every single matchup up to this opponent, either on the broadcast, the All-22, or both.\n\n**I'm happy to engage in any discussions and disagreements, but please stay respectful and don't insinuate that I didn't put enough work into this.**\n\nLet\u2019s get to the full rankings:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n# 1. Los Angeles Rams (10-3)\n\nWhen I ranked the Rams as the number two team in the NFL back [after the first month of the season](https://halilsrealfootballtalk.com/2025/10/01/nfl-power-rankings-after-the-first-quarter-of-the-2025-season/), there was outrage, especially for putting them ahead of the Eagles, who they had previously lost against on a potential game-winning field goal being blocked. Right now, even though there are two AFC contenders that have an extra win on their resume, I believe they pretty clearly belong at the top of the list. Even if their week 13 loss to the Panthers served as a reminder that anyone can be beaten if they lose the turnover battle, nobody has really been able to stop their offense since they traveled to London prior to their week eight bye, when they started to diversify their personnel groupings. They\u2019re in a league of their own when you look at EPA per play (0.226) and success rate (55.8%) since that point, while their run game has continued to ascend. Meanwhile, their defensive line has the ability to take over games, as one of only two teams with four players inside the top-50 in pressures, and while their offense is basically impossible to defend in goal-line situations, only the Broncos have kept opponents out of the end zone once they\u2019ve reached the red area at a higher rate (42.5% TD rate) than this group. It\u2019s the Rams and their division rivals in a tier of their own currently when it comes to overall DVOA, Matt Stafford is your MVP front-runner, and they\u2019re understandably the betting favorites for the Super Bowl.\n\n.\n\n# 2. Seattle Seahawks (10-3)\u00a0\n\nFor the Seahawks, even though the offensive side of the ball has been the story based on how we viewed this team coming into the year, we have to start with this devastating defense. They\u2019re the other unit I mentioned with four names inside the top-50 for defensive pressures, and they actually have six guys with 30+ (the cut-off for the top-50 being 36). They can send waves at quarterbacks, which is paired with various looks up front that are beautifully married to what they do on the back-end, and then all of the guys they put out there, just fly around the field. Second-round pick Nick Emmanwori becoming Mike Macdonald\u2019s new version of Kyle Hamilton as a Swiss Army knife, has been huge in becoming number one in schedule-adjusted DVOA. Now, offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak\u2019s vision for Sam Darnold quarterbacking this heavy personnel, hyper-aggressive play-action attack, is what has me believing in them being the biggest threat to their NFC West foes \u2013 as we saw with a 61-yard field goal miss being the difference in their initial matchup in L.A., when Sam had by far his worst showing of the season. As they\u2019ve at least become an average rushing team to complement the way they want to operate, with Jaxon Smith-Njigba\u2019s historic year being the driving force behind the number one offense in net yards per dropback (8.2 yards average), they can beat anyone as long as they don\u2019t give the ball away excessively.\n\n.\n\n# 3. Green Bay Packers (9-3-1)\u00a0\n\nEven after their 2-1-1 start heading into their bye week, I had pretty high hopes for the Packers, and they\u2019ve actually moved up by a couple of spots in my rankings since then. With the valleys and peaks of their quarterback and offense altogether, I got a bit more concerned for a while, but now they\u2019ve ripped off wins by 7+ points against all three of their divisional opponents these past three weeks, with Jordan Love performing at the highest level we\u2019ve seen from him yet. Sure, there\u2019s a pass or two every week that has you scratching your head because he tried to force a deep ball into double-coverage or a throw into a super tight window, but the down-to-down consistency, even with his tendencies of fading away unnecessarily, has been excellent. Love ranks number one in EPA per dropback (0.303), as Christian Watson has established himself as a vertical threat again, and you felt the gravity of Jayden Reed as more of their designed touch option, just coming back off injured reserve. They\u2019re the only team to convert better than half of their third-down attempts and they\u2019re second in red zone touchdown percentage (68.1%). Meanwhile, the Packers D is one of the most under-discussed units in the league. While they could still use better contributions from guys up front along with Micah Parsons, who ranks third in total QB pressures individually (74), they haven\u2019t been as reliant on takeaways as last year. Recently losing Devonte Wyatt for the rest of the season is a bummer, but they\u2019re even more cohesive in the way they command space in coverage and the situational awareness they show in year two under DC Jeff Hafley, which is how they rank seventh in dropback success rate surrendered (43.9%).\n\n.\n\n# 4. Denver Broncos (11-2)\n\nWhile we can have a discussion about Green Bay getting the nod, I do believe there\u2019s a defined drop-off from the top of the NFC to the pair of teams atop the AFC, even if they have that extra win in their pockets. I don\u2019t quite look at either one of them as being as complementary as their counterparts. Having said that, they deserve to be up here by routinely taking care of who\u2019s been put in front of them. The Broncos embody that idea more than anyone in the league. Now winners of ten straight, they\u2019ve had a couple of dominant showings, they\u2019ve grinded out some low-scoring affairs, they\u2019ve rallied in the fourth quarter with Bo Nix suddenly flipping the script when needed, they\u2019ve had some key plays on special teams, and they\u2019ve fended off their opponents when they did have chances. Currently, their defense is right on pace for the all-time record for sacks in a season (72), Vance Joseph is a mad scientist with how he ties the front- and back-end together (as I broke down in [my most recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW4mcbDIr9I)), and they just got back reigning DPOY Pat Surtain at corner. They rank number one in third-down (30.9%) and red zone TD percentage (40.0%). The offense remains kind of a rollercoaster, which is why I made the distinction to the two top-ranked teams. Denver\u2019s run game has been more feast-or-famine since J.K. Dobbins got hurt, and while that can bring an element of unpredictability, you don\u2019t know which pass-catcher to rely upon on a weekly basis. Nonetheless, they\u2019ve been able to put points on the board when needed most, as Bo has been credited with an NFL-best six game-winning drives, and no team has surrendered sacks at a lower rate (3.5%).\n\n.\n\n# 5. New England Patriots (11-2)\n\nThe story for the Pats is quite different. I actually believe their quarterback Drake Maye has been the engine that has powered this team to a shocking ten-game win streak of their own. While we can argue that Matthew Stafford has played the position at the highest level this season and Josh Allen remains the biggest force of nature in the league, I would throw in that nobody has created more with less than this second-year starter. Even with the much-maligned last-place schedule they\u2019ve faced, you can\u2019t deny the ability to mitigate negative plays behind a below-average O-line, and how he\u2019s pushed the ball vertically for big plays (140.0 passer rating on throws of 20+ air yards). That\u2019s where the fact that this is a team-oriented ranking comes into play, however, as they\u2019re largely relying on role players around the QB in a well-coached offense under Josh McDaniels, while ranking 30^(th) in rushing success rate (34.4%). Defensively, it\u2019s kind of a similar story, where they\u2019ve relied on a bunch of rookies and lower-tier free agents to fill in spots, especially with their one big-ticket item Milton Williams on injured reserve, but they\u2019re so multiple in the fronts they present, how they change the picture on quarterbacks and then they just enforce their will on opponents with the way they\u2019re laying the wood. They\u2019ve fallen off a little bit in that regard, but they\u2019re still allowing just under 90 rushing yards per game, they rarely miss tackles, and then they\u2019re a nightmare for protections with all the movement thrown at them post-snap. It\u2019s not a perfect metric, but ranking 14^(th) in team DVOA is at least a point of concern going forward.\n\n.\n\n# 6. Buffalo Bills (9-4)\u00a0\n\nWhen the Bengals were setting up 1^(st) &amp; 10 from the Buffalo 33-yard line with five-and-a-half minutes left in the fourth quarter this past Sunday, it certainly didn\u2019t feel like this is where the Bills would end up finding themselves. Christian Benford snatching a pick-six after getting to Joe Burrow on a corner blitz earlier and then getting another interception off a batted pass completely turned the tables for a defense that has largely struggled this season. Against the run in particular, opponents have been able to routinely take advantage of their unwillingness to alter personnel and some of the fits opponents have pushed them into, as they rank 31^(st) in rush EPA (0.045), and I even made a [video specifically on that topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvbsRayxI9E). Yet, if they can simply get one or two of these takeaways per week, Superman can carry the day for them, including in a snowstorm. What we\u2019re seeing from Buffalo\u2019s offense right now is their best version of themselves. Rookie tight-end Jackson Hawes, who functions almost like an extra tackle on run plays, has somewhat replaced their six-offensive linemen sets, yet he can sneak out on play-action a couple of times a game, once they\u2019ve hammered away with James Cook (although he needs to protect the ball better). And then Josh Allen can put on the cape when needed, where he provides deadly throws out of structure and scrambles, including when they do spread opponents out more. They\u2019re now back up to the top-three in success rate (48.3%) and EPA per play (0.141) offensively.\n\n.\n\n# 7. Houston Texans (8-5)\n\nIs there a more fun unit to watch right now than this Texans defense? I already extensively talked about [the tandem of Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW4mcbDIr9I) off either edge and how they play off each other recently, but the way they swarm to the football and the physicality even their defensive backs bring to the table, gives them an attitude that really gets you excited. You could tell Jalen Pitre de-cleating Chiefs receivers earlier in the game got into the heads of those guys as they thought about extending for the ball this past Sunday night. That duo up front being top-six in all pass-rush-relevant metrics each, paired with the way they challenge opponents during their routes, and then the range of someone like Calen Bullock from the deep post makes them a nightmare for any quarterback. They\u2019re at the bottom of the league in blitz and disguise rate, yet they\u2019re allowing an NFL-low 16 points per game. Offensively, it\u2019s been more of a struggle at times, trying to get the run game cracked up and C.J. Stroud continuing to look uncomfortable behind leaky protections, which also got him knocked out for three-and-a-half games. They still rank 29^(th) in rushing success rate (34.5%), but they\u2019ve at least become a little more effective in short-yardage situations, and some of these young receivers around Nico Collins have started to step up. Understanding they can play through their defense, they\u2019ve really limited turnovers, with just one total over the past month, and even when they stagnated at Kansas City, Stroud was able to deliver a handful of plays out of structure. They\u2019re now the number one in the [HRF.com](http://HRF.com) statistic, beginning their drives 4.6 yards further ahead than their opponents on average.\n\n.\n\n# 8. Detroit Lions (8-5)\n\nThe 2025 season was kind of hanging in the balance this past Thursday Night against the surging Cowboys, after just getting swept by the Packers, yet they were able to access a gear on offense that had kind of been missing in previous weeks. They\u2019ve fallen to dead-average (17^(th)) in rushing success rate for the year (41.5%), but Jahmyr Gibbs is so explosive that he can rip off massive chunks whenever he is given room to operate, which Detroit has utilized more as a receiver as well. We\u2019ve felt the presence of Jameson Williams as their big-play threat through the air more since Dan Campbell has taken over play-calling duties, and they just had a vintage moment to seal this past win, when they called up a heavy play-action concept against Dallas, selling out for the run. For the year, they\u2019re number one in yards per play (6.2). Detroit\u2019s defense surrendering 89 total points over these last three weeks is more alarming, but generally, I\u2019ve been pretty impressed with what Kelvin Sheppard has done as a first-year coordinator. Adjusting for schedule, they rank sixth in defensive DVOA. Once again, injuries have really taken a toll on this unit, especially in the secondary, which will only get worse with Brian Branch now headed for IR with a torn Achilles. So, they\u2019re hoping for better health once we get to this next calendar year, they\u2019re only allowing 3.9 yards per rush, and they do have the league\u2019s leader in pressures Aidan Hutchinson (80). Without some of these contributors on the back-end, they\u2019ll need to adjust their man-heavy tendencies going forward, however.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0a9li9qrj6g1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2189789101f8b3905d281b583c6d576be42183b\n\n.\u00a0\n\n[](https://halilsrealfootballtalk.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/49ers.png)\n\n# 9. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)\u00a0\n\nFirst and foremost, it\u2018s pretty incredible how we got here, when we could easily be sitting here with the Niners record flipped and talk about the myriad of injuries they\u2018ve suffered. To be without clearly their two most integral defenders in Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, yet somehow have all these guys stepping up, looking this well-prepared and energetic, is a major credit to Robert Saleh. They\u2019re dead-last in sacks (16) and you can move the ball on them, but they\u2019re allowing points on the eighth-lowest percentage of drives against (36.2%). At the same time, we also have to commend Kyle Shanahan\u2018s patience with the run game whilst navigating through Brock Purdy being either hurt or erratic, and fully tapping into Christian McCaffrey\u2018s dual-threat, being well on pace for becoming the first NFL player with 1000 yards rushing and receiving each in multiple seasons. Overall, San Francisco is now up to fifth in offensive success rate (48.1%) despite all of their receiving options being in and out of the lineup. As they\u2019ve transitioned to being more of a traditional dropback team, how they utilize all five eligibles in the pattern to space out concepts and how they weaponize motions with real purpose in that area, has really helped them navigate being limited personnel-wise and overcome games with multiple turnovers. What\u2019ll be interesting is if those institutional advantages they have can help them overcome some slight talent deficiencies compared to the NFL playoff field, although they may be more equipped than others when they get to face one of their divisional opponents for a third team.\n\n.\n\n# 10. Chicago Bears (9-4)\n\nOn one hand, a team that just sat there as the NFC\u2019s number one seed until coming up just short on fourth-and-one at Lambeau Field against their hated rivals may seem to deserve an even higher ranking, but at the same time, cracking the top definitely feels like an accomplishment for this group. More than anything, head coach Ben Johnson has truly changed the culture in Chicago, but you do see his fingerprints all over the offense. There are so many interesting little elements to their run game of showing the threat of misdirection or giving pause to defenders on the second level, but at the heart of it \u2013 as Marshawn Lynch would say \u2013 they\u2019re going to \u201crun through a motherf\\*cker\u2019s face\u201d. Just watch back seventh-round rookie Kyle Monangai meeting Packers linebacker Quay Walker in the hole this past Sunday. They now rank second to only the Rams in rushing success rate (47.0%). As it\u2019s to be expected with so many young targets and Caleb Williams just learning the offense, their pass game isn\u2019t nearly as clean and efficient, but they can hit big plays off play-action, and their young QB can has become an elite sack escape artist, who can find completions or valuable yardage as a scrambler deep into the play-clock. We\u2019ll see if they can carry this through the rest of the season, but the defense has certainly been more takeaway-dependent, as they lead the league with 27 total. They simply can\u2019t provide pressure (with a bottom-six rate currently), and only the Bengals have allowed more plays of 20+ yards (58), but they should at least continue to get back contributors in the back-seven.\n\n.\n\n# 11. Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)\u00a0\n\nIronically enough, this is exactly where I put the Jags following their 3-1 start, as I liked plenty of elements of what got them there, but also had questions about the long-term viability of how they were operating. A lot of those things still feel similarly, as they followed that up by beating the Chiefs before having a lot of their weaknesses exposed by the Rams in a beatdown across the pond, before collapsing in a Davis Mills-led Texans comeback soon after. Yet, they went on to overwhelm a beat-up Chargers team and just took back control of the AFC South with their win over the Colts, in which we also saw Daniel Jones tear his Achilles. Jacksonville\u2019s run game has been really up-and-down, and clever play-designers can find ways to take advantage of their defensive tendencies, but there\u2019s something on both sides of the ball that makes me feel a lot better about where they stand. After Brian Thomas Jr. seemed to shy away from extending for the ball in traffic early in the year, Trevor Lawrence is now attacking the middle of the field much more frequently with the trade for Jakobi Meyers and Brenton Strange returning from injury. And their defense now feels so much more compact in how they squeeze down passing windows in zone coverage, rather than leaving their DBs on islands, while Devin Lloyd has been a magnet for the field (five interceptions in 11 games), along with he and Foye Oluokun coming downhill against the run. Only the Bears have taken the ball away more often (23).\n\n.\n\n# 12. Los Angeles Chargers (9-4)\u00a0\n\nBased on the state of their offense line at this point and how they\u2019ve felt completely outmatched in three of their four losses \u2013 to the Commanders(!), Colts and Jaguars \u2013 it\u2019s almost unfathomable how they sit here with nine wins. After their 3-0 start, I made a video about how [Justin Herbert had entered the \u201cGiant Robot Fighting arena\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYtQnFnxF1E), which now rings as true as ever, since you\u2019re not even going to need a full hand to count the quarterbacks on the planet who could\u2019ve even allowed them to be competitive this past Monday night, much less win the game. According to Pro Football Focus, Justin Fields is the only quarterback with 200+ dropbacks who\u2019s been pressured at a higher rate than Herbert (42.5%), and those Eagles defenders were in his lap before he could even get to the top of his drops for the majority of that matchup. So I don\u2019t really know how much longer he can hang in there, already with broken fingers, since the Bolts also only rank 25^(th) in rushing success rate (38.9%), but his play extension skills and throws under heat have just been bonkers. Somehow they\u2019re converting third downs at the third-highest rate in the league (47.1%). That\u2019s also where they coincidentally rank defensively in that area (34.4%), as that group just forced five turnovers and gave the ball back to their quarterback enough times. Jesse Minter once again is putting one of the most well-prepared units out there on the field, when you look at how they digest route combinations and put themselves in positions to make plays on the ball. We\u2019ve seen them get pushed around at times in the run game, but they\u2019re willing to make the trade-off of living in soft box counts for not allowing explosives through the air (27 \u2013 second-fewest in the league).\n\n.\n\n# 13. Philadelphia Eagles (8-5)\u00a0\n\nWell, well, well. Eagles fans wanted to EVISCERATE me when I dared to put the Eagles below the Rams (at number three) in my power rankings following week four, shortly after they won the head-to-head on a walk-off game-winning field goal being blocked. At the time, I thought there were some underlying issues with the offense especially that could come back to bite them, and they\u2019ve now lost three straight. Something similar occurred when I placed Jalen Hurts 16^(th) in my QB rankings as part of the \u201cestablished veterans\u201d tier. I was wrong with that one \u2013 he should\u2019ve been even lower. I know this past Monday Night affair was an outlier, but if the main selling points for Hurts are his turnover avoidance and what he provides as a scrambler, as those are now fading away, what is he really offering at this moment? Sure, he can lay those go balls out in front, and we might be telling a slightly different story if A.J. Brown hauls in one of them that were dropped into the bucket, but this entire offense feels broken. Jalen refused to attempt these tight-window throws against zone coverage previously, their pass concepts are pretty elementary, and while we at least saw some flashes of 2024 Saquon against the Chargers, he still ranks 36^(th) among 47 qualified rushers in expected yards per carry (3.8), according to Next Gen Stats. Vic Fangio and company just nearly killed Justin Herbert with an absurd rate of early pressures, and through having more options of what they can do with that fifth DB on the field, that\u2019s felt like less of a liability through the air. They\u2019re still right on the edge of the top ten in success rate, DVOA and EPA per play overall, but recent trends of being out-leveraged on extra gaps created in the run game are concerning.\n\n.\n\n# 14. Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1)\u00a0\n\nIt only feels right that the Cowboys rank right behind their NFC East rivals, who seemed like they had the division locked up already a month ago. The big reason that there\u2019s at least a chance that this could still flip is their head-to-head win in Dallas two weeks ago. Their offense has been lighting up the scoreboard pretty much all season. Only the Colts have scored on a higher percentage of their drives (48.6%), with a supercomputer at quarterback, George Pickens outperforming Ceedee Lamb as the team\u2019s top receiver, who gives you a little more outside the numbers, a re-invigorated run game under OC Klayton Adams, and a booming kicker, who makes you a threat to put three points on the board as soon as you cross midfield. With increased rates of play-action and motion at the snap, they\u2019re a much tougher unit to prepare for. However, they\u2019ve also turned the ball over 18 times (tied for sixth-most), and the other side of the ball has largely been ugly. Even with recent improvements thanks to trading for Quinnen Williams and getting a couple of young contributors back from injury, for the season, they still ranked ahead of only the Bengals in defensive DVOA and have allowed opponents to score on the second-highest rate of drives (47.9%). Where they\u2019ve shown massive strides over this past month, coming off their bye week, has been run defense, lowering their success rate allowed by just over 10% (38.2% now). The pairing of Quinnen and Osa Odighizuwa gives them a dangerous interior duo of pass-rushers, but they\u2019re relying on Jadeveon Clowney to clean up quarterbacks getting flushed, and you can certainly attack their linebackers in coverage. That\u2019s how they\u2019re also tied with Cincy for a league-high in third-down conversion rate (47.8%). Funnily enough, they\u2019ve been hurt but also benefited more from penalty yardage for/against them.\n\n.\n\n# 15. Kansas City Chiefs (6-7)\u00a0\n\nRight behind the Cowboys is the other participant from last year\u2019s Super Bowl, who those guys have beaten recently. Thanksgiving at Jerry World wasn\u2019t the low point for a KC team that has now lost four of their past five games, when they should\u2019ve been primed for a run over the second half of the schedule following the bye. Where their season probably ended in reality was this past Sunday Night, when the frustrations of a season that seemingly never truly got off the ground boiled over, and Andy Reid got overeager to kick-start the offense by going for it on fourth-and-one from their own 31-yard line. It used to be opponents getting tight and making questionable decisions based on the Chiefs' mystique. Even when it felt like they were the ones dictating terms defensively in the second half of that matchup, with Steve Spagnuolo in assault mode by blitz, and they got a vintage Chris Jones performance, after they had been average on that side of the ball by most metrics, they couldn\u2019t cash on it. What\u2019s crazy about all of this is the fact that on the surface, as you go through their statistical profile, it\u2019s pretty easy to make an argument that they\u2019re actually a little better than last year\u2019s 15-2 team. Even after their 20-10 loss at home to the Texans, they\u2019re just inside the top ten in point differential for the season (+63), and they rank sixth in schedule-adjusted DVOA. The pendulum has truly swung the opposite way, as they\u2019re 1-6 in one-score games, and simply haven\u2019t been able to make the key plays in the biggest moments and come out on top. So if they somehow were to get into the tournament against an AFC field largely lacking (positive) experience in January, they could end up being dangerous, but head-to-head losses to the Jaguars, Bills, Texans and their two AFC West foes, make that nearly impossible.\n\n.\n\n# 16. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-6)\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve reached the NFC South portion of the program and you could easily flip these two teams, if you like. What that decision comes down to is how heavily you weigh recent form versus what they can be at their best. Ultimately, I don\u2019t look at either side being able to a deep playoff push, but there are a few more things I think bank on with the Bucs in that set-up, hosting what probably will be the five-seed \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen in the past. The run game hasn\u2019t nearly been as efficient or well-constructed without Liam Coen calling the shots and they\u2019ll need to work Mike Evans back into the offense, yet right now they just feel a little off compared to when they were firing on all cylinders throughout their 5-1 start. Baker putting the ball a tad high and Emeka Egbuka not being able to haul it in for a likely game-winning touchdown on a double move this past Sunday against the Saints best illustrates that. Somewhat quietly, they\u2019ve plummeted to 28^(th) in offensive success rate (42.1%), while Baker has reversed to being more of a net negative as a scrambler. Defensively, I actually really like the cohesiveness this secondary has reached, paired with Vita Vea being a wall in the middle, setting the table for the fourth-best defense in rushing success rate (35.3%). You know you\u2019re getting a bunch of fire zones on early downs trying to push offenses behind the chains and they have guys who can make plays on the ball when they can play with their eyes on it. At the same time, there are some pretty obvious tendencies with how they match personnel, you can find success by putting their linebackers into conflict, and they\u2019ve allowed opponents to turn red zone trips into touchdowns at the third-highest rate (68.8%). They are however tied for the fourth-best turnover differential in the league (+9).\n\n.\n\n.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m16qm7cvrj6g1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e9505acfd207d81232a67a3df9d143cd996e268\n\n.\n\n# 17. Carolina Panthers (7-6)\u00a0\n\nOn the other side of this argument is a Panthers team that has put together the biggest rollercoaster season of anyone in the league, now having alternated between wins and losses these past seven weeks, including no-shows by their offense against the Saints and 49ers, but also two of the most impressive upsets you\u2019re going to find, winning slow-tempo, run-heavy contest at Lambeau Field, but then also out-pacing my number one team in the Rams most recently, fueled by three turnover from their defense to put them over the top. Nobody has oscillated at the same frequency as the team overall as their quarterback Bryce Young. He looks totally uncomfortable one week, but then hangs in the pocket and beats defenses with pin-point throws as the rush is closing in, the next. At their core however, they want to rely on pounding the rock, Dave Canales seems to have a couple of designer plays crafted against their opponents every week, they now have a guy in first-round pick Tetairoa McMillan if they do face man-coverage, and only the Broncos have put together more game-winning drives at the end (five). Although we have seen some improvement from their defense finally under Ejiro Evero, they\u2019re main issue is that they simply can\u2019t get off the field, allowing opponents to convert 46.8% of third and fourth downs combined. Derrick Brown has been tremendous again this season, but they just don\u2019t have anyone they can rely upon off the edge, as they\u2019ve registered the lowest pressure rate in the league (21.6%). Another funny quirk I found in my research is that they\u2019re the only team perfectly balanced with 17 turnovers on offense and defense each, and those have been integral in their success. Thankfully, we\u2019ll get this divisional rivalry twice over the final three weeks.\n\n.\u00a0\n\n# 18. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6) \u00a0\n\nMoving on to our duo of AFC North blue bloods, who just battled it out in Baltimore, in what was one of the uglier iterations even of their storied series. I can see how some Steelers fans can spin this into them being able to make the key plays needed with their backs against the wall coming into that day, and talk themselves into this version of Aaron Rodgers paired with an opportunistic defense. But let me ask you guys this \u2013 Are you really satisfied with what you\u2019re currently watching? Even if we accept that some of these questionable calls ultimately even out over the course of a season, and while I still can\u2019t believe the Isaiah Likely touchdown was reversed, I\u2019d argue Pittsburgh was the more deserving side, we have to wonder what the ceiling of this operation looks like. The formula for success is pretty clear with them. Rodgers needs to mix in the occasional vertical shot with all the quick game stuff this offense revolves around, paired with some quick-hitting runs from the shotgun. Meanwhile, they\u2019ve realized that they don\u2019t have the bodies in coverage outside of Joey Porter Jr. to play extensive man-coverage, but rather they need to crowd spaces and force quarterbacks to hold onto the ball, in order for their pass-rush to get home. Only the Bears have forced more turnovers (23), and they\u2019re tied for sixth in total sacks (36). They\u2019re certainly vulnerable on the ground on the edges, as Buffalo illustrated when they rushed for 249 yards just the week prior, while your offense doesn\u2019t counterbalance that with many explosives of their own, as Rodgers is still tied for a league-low 6.4 yards average depth of target.\n\n.\n\n# 19. Baltimore Ravens (6-7)\u00a0\n\nDo I feel like Baltimore is still the team with the higher ceiling among these two? And is there a path for them putting together another four-game win streak to end the year, before hosting a home playoff game with momentum? Absolutely. I played around with the playoff predictor a little bit and found that as long as they win the rematch in Pittsburgh, they\u2019d basically have the tie-breaker based on success against common opponents, as long as they otherwise win the same number of games. Having said that, I don\u2019t have any real data points that would suggest we\u2019ll at some point see a version of these Ravens that resembles those from the last couple of years. The fact that they\u2019re tied for second with 5.0 yards per-carry is kind of a lie, as they\u2019ve ripped off the occasional explosive, but they actually rank 22^(nd) in rushing success rate (40.1%). Moreover, the lack of answers with their protection plans, Lamar has looked as skittish inside the pocket as we\u2019ve seen in a while, along with lacking that extra gear when he does escape, and they seem allergic to holding onto the ball as they get to the end zone. Only two offenses have converted red zone drives into touchdowns at a lower rate than them (44.9%). The defensive numbers are kind of skewed by the various injuries they dealt with prior to pulling themselves out of that 1-5 hole, but they simply can\u2019t get to the quarterback with just four rushers, as only the 49ers and Panthers have recorded fewer sacks (19). For as much as they were able to hold down bad offenses from scoring points for a while, we\u2019ve now seen what Joe Burrow and Aaron Rodgers are capable of against them when they never truly feel uncomfortable.\n\n.\n\n# 20. Miami Dolphins (6-7)\u00a0\n\nThe fact that the Dolphins now sit here with the same record as AFC titans like the Chiefs and Ravens, considering how their season started, feels absolutely. They were 1-6 at one point. The Browns defense absolutely destroyed them at the end of that stretch, and even after a shocking 34-10 win over the Falcons at the time, they were quickly brought back down to earth by the Ravens the following Thursday Night, to where many were just waiting for news on Mike McDaniel getting fired potentially the next day. Instead, they moved on from GM Chris Grier, and they\u2019ve now won four straight, and have a sliver of hope for a Wildcard berth at least. The key to their turnaround has been the fact that they\u2019ve gone away from being this high-flying passing attack and turning into one of the premier running teams. Right now, they rank behind only the Rams and Colts in rush EPA (0.025), as Devon Achane is averaging 5.8 yards per carry and no other team has ripped off more explosives on the ground (14). On the flipside, they\u2019ve defended the run at a higher level, with growth from their pair of rookie D-tackles and just allowing their linebackers to attack the backfield. Since they now push opponents into more defined passing situations, DC Anthony Weaver can really shine with various pressure looks and forcing quarterbacks to re-configure what\u2019s happening coverage-wise post-snap. That\u2019s set the table for logging ten takeaways combined over this four-game win streak, and Rasul Douglas has at least solidified one of those corner spots that killed them earlier in the year.\n\n.\n\n# 21. Indianapolis Colts (8-5)\u00a0\n\nAll I can say here is this \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Colts fans. Although they had to go to overtime for it, they must\u2019ve felt great flying back from Germany after their win over the Falcons, to put them at 8-2 and all but wrap up the AFC South crown. Since the bye week that followed, the lost in heartbreaking fashion at Kansas City in OT, an All-Pro corner in Sauce Gardner, who they had just traded two first-round picks for, suffered a calf strain a couple of snaps into the Texans game, and this past Sunday at Jacksonville \u2013 their house of horrors \u2013 Daniel Jones tore his Achilles, before the Jags pulled away from them and took control of the division race. By giving up that draft capital, they pretty much took themselves out of the rookie quarterback market these next two years and locked themselves into the veteran, who they\u2019re hoping will be close to 100% again when 2026 kicks off. I was dubious about the move at the time, with the logic of adding a true difference-maker at a position of need for a team with realistic Super Bowl aspirations in a watered-down AFC. Even now, this is still the number four team in total DVOA for the season, which generally weighs offense more heavily. They also remain as the lone team to score on over half of their drives (51.2%), and only the Lions have a higher yards-per-play average (6.1) than what Shane Steichen has orchestrated. We still needed to see the defense come together with Sauce and Charvarius Ward on the outside, but only the Broncos have surrendered a lower yards-per-carry average (3.8 YPC), Laiatu Latu had emerged as a problem off the edge, and DC Lou Anarumo does have the capacity to put together one-off gameplans to challenge elite quarterbacks.\n\n.\n\n# 22. Cincinnati Bengals (4-9)\u00a0\n\nWhen looking at the standings, you see that the Bengals don\u2019t have that \u201ce\u201d (for eliminated) next to their names quite yet, but giving away that Bills game this past Sunday probably sealed their fate. Once again, they were already in field goal range up by three prior to that game-changing pick-six by Christian Benford. They were at the brink of winning back-to-back contests at Baltimore and Buffalo, while the Ravens and Steelers were involved in a slopfest for who would take control of the AFC North, almost by default. Considering the run they went on last year, rattling off five straight wins, but not getting help from others on the final Sunday of the season, now Joe Burrow coming back from his turf toe injury and performing as well up to that point, this has to be highly disappointing. Having said that, the defense is still a complete mess. They rank dead-last in defensive DVOA, they\u2019ve given up an NFL-high 63(!) plays of 20+ yards, and they\u2019re allowing 2.1 points more per game than any other team in the league (31.8 PPG). Not having the one impact player from 2024 in Trey Hendrickson has certainly been felt, but this is what it really comes down to \u2013 Cincy has created the fewest tackles for loss (40), while according to [pro-football-reference.com](http://pro-football-reference.com), they\u2019ve missed 143 attempted stops \u2013 no other team has more than 107.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n# Since I reached the character limit, you can read the rest of the analysis [here](https://halilsrealfootballtalk.com/2025/12/10/nfl-power-rankings-heading-into-the-fourth-quarter-of-the-2025-season/)!\n\n.\n\n.\n\n# 23.

    "content": "<p>Judge James Wynn of the Fourth Circuit was content to have President Biden replace him. But in December 2024, when it became clear Biden's nominee would not be confirmed,Wynn rescinded his senior status. He offered no actual reason, but we do not have to ignore reality: He didn't want Trump to replace him. Two other District Court judges made the same decision. Yet the judicial misconduct process refused to acknowledge this reality. I wrote <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2024/12/15/brazenly-partisan-judge-wynn-withdraws-senior-status-because-trump/\">two</a> <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2024/12/17/what-is-the-remedy-for-judge-wynns-brazenly-partisan-withdrawal-of-senior-status/\">posts</a> on this issue.</p>\n<p>Judge Wynn was the subject of my latest column for\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.civitasinstitute.org/research/brazenly-partisan-judges-scrutinize-trumps-mind-but-refuse-to-explain-themselves\"><em>Civitas Outlook</em></a>. Here is an excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The judges offered no actual explanation for their decision. Judge Wynn, for example, wrote to President Biden that \"after careful consideration, I have decided to continue in regular active service.\" Upon \"careful consideration,\" is code for \"further election.\" Senator Tom Tillis of North Carolina said that Wynn made this \"brazenly partisan\" decision because he \"clearly takes issue with the fact that Donald Trump was just elected President.\" The Article III Project filed a </span><a href=\"https://www.article3project.org/post/a3p-files-judicial-misconduct-complaint-against-u-s-circuit-judge-james-a-wynn-over-rescinded-retirement-announcement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">judicial misconduct complaint</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> against these three judges. The complaint charged that \"Judge Wynn's decision to rescind his announcement was likely made because of the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.\" The group states that Wynn \"had a change of heart solely because\" Trump won.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Judge Wynn responded to the complaint. He didn't offer any actual explanation for rescinding his senior status. Wynn insisted that federal law does not prevent him from changing his mind. Rather, he said, \"[c]hoices about retirement and senior status are deeply personal and often influenced by multiple factors.\" One would think that Wynn could offer some reason to defend his action. But he offered none. Instead, he insisted that he was under no obligation to explain his motivation. Wynn maintained that \"no court has ever found it proper to inquire into an Article III judge's reasons for taking, or not taking, senior status.\" Wynn added, \"Accusations of partisanship should not be entertained absent specific evidence of misconduct.\" If the judge made this decision for some legitimate reason, it would have been straightforward to state it. But he didn't; instead, he hid behind a legal process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In October 2025, the misconduct complaints against </span><a href=\"https://ww3.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/8729662d-7a97-4607-aec1-1456569d164a/3/doc/24-90167-jm.pdf#xml=https://ww3.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/8729662d-7a97-4607-aec1-1456569d164a/3/hilite/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Judge Wynn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and the </span><a href=\"https://ww3.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/8729662d-7a97-4607-aec1-1456569d164a/2/doc/24-90168-jm.pdf#xml=https://ww3.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/8729662d-7a97-4607-aec1-1456569d164a/2/hilite/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">other</span></a> <a href=\"https://ww3.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/8729662d-7a97-4607-aec1-1456569d164a/1/doc/24-90169-jm.pdf#xml=https://ww3.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/8729662d-7a97-4607-aec1-1456569d164a/1/hilite/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">two</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> judges were dismissed. Chief Judge Debra Livingston wrote the opinion in each case. Livingston found \"there is no genuine issue of fact.\" She added that whether \"the Judge considered the outcome of the election as one factor influencing his decision to withdraw the January 5 letter\" was \"a factual issue I need not resolve.\" Had Chief Judge Livingston simply asked Judge Wynn </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> he rescinded his senior status, the judge could have defended himself with some legitimate reason. But he didn't offer such a reason, because there is no plausible, legitimate reason. Regrettably, there is a brazen double standard for brazenly partisan judges. The federal courts routinely scrutinized President Trump's motivations for improper purposes. But when it comes to rooting out judicial misconduct, judges hide behind a veil of ignorance.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>And the conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is a never-ending stream of faux-outrage about judicial ethics, but these self-professed experts ignore actual problems where judges engage in partisanship. Let's not forget Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Before the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/11/us/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-no-fan-of-donald-trump-critiques-latest-term.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FGinsburg%2C%20Ruth%20Bader&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics%C2%AEion=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2016 election</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Ginsburg called Trump a \"faker\" and said she would move to New Zealand if he prevailed. And the day after the election, Justice Ginsburg </span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/justice-ginsburg-wears-dissent-collar-following-contentious-election-n681571\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">wore her \"dissent\" jabot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to Court. Ginsburg was clearly protesting Trump's election. Yet Ginsburg didn't leave the country, as her retirement would have given Trump the power to appoint her replacement. Ginsburg likely had the same thoughts as Judge Wynn. Fast-forward four years. On Ginsburg's deathbed, her </span><a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2020/09/19/justice-ginsburgs-last-words/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">last words</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> were, \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\" Ginsburg said what Wynn clearly thought. Should we just look at Ginsburg's action behind the veil of ignorance? She was a brazenly partisan critic of Trump, yet she decided a host of cases against Trump while in office. Is there much of a practical difference between what Ginsburg did and what Wynn did?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In recent years, there were routine calls for impeachment when Justice Alito's wife flew a flag, and Justice Thomas's wife engaged in politics. Yet when we see progressive judges personally crossing the lines into the political realm, there are only crickets. Here, the judiciary took no action to police political judges \u2014 not even a reprimand. Given this failure to acknowledge reality, the only remaining remedy for political judges is the political process. And if those steps are inadequate, further remedies should be on the table.\u00a0</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/11/new-in-civitas-outlook-brazenly-partisan-judges-scrutinize-trumps-mind-but-refuse-to-explain-themselves/\">New in &lt;i&gt;Civitas Outlook&lt;/i&gt;: &quot;Brazenly Partisan&quot; Judges Scrutinize Trump&#039;s Mind, But Refuse To Explain Themselves</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>From <a href=\"https://flcourts-media.flcourts.gov/content/download/2482282/opinion/Opinion_2024-1560.pdf\"><em>Russell v. Mells</em></a>, decided yesterday by Florida Court of Appeal (Second District) Chief Judge Matthew Lucas, joined by Judges Robert Morris and Susan H. Rothstein-Youakim:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because [one] case citation [in defense counsel Attorney McLane's filing] appeared to have been \"hallucinated\" (most likely by a generative artificial intelligence program) and because the other two case citations contained misquotations, we issued an order to show cause to appellee's counsel. In our order, we directed counsel to file a written response explaining how these case citations and quotations were generated. We further warned that the response should also show cause as to why sanctions shouldn't be imposed.</p>\n<p>In her response, Attorney McLane stated that the three case citations \"were researched via computer generated searches\" and acknowledged that she \"failed to fully vet these searches.\" With respect to the two misquotations, she stated that \"the errors &hellip; were not substantive in nature and were primarily the result of miss placed [sic] quotation marks.\" She conceded that the citation to \"Cade v. Roberts\" was \"substantive but was not made for the purpose of misleading the Court.\" She then noted that there was Florida case law supporting \"the substance of the argument\" on this point, presumably meaning that the quoted text in her brief about motions to dismiss could find support elsewhere in Florida law. {She never tells us where, and there is no text we've found in Florida law that directly matches the purported quotation she set forth in the brief. But substantively Ms. McLane is correct.}</p>\n<p>Lastly, we couldn't help but notice, the signature line of counsel's response to our order to show cause appears to have been executed by someone on behalf of Ms. McLane, instead of by Ms. McLane herself. {While a delegated signature execution may not have been a legal or ethical impropriety, under these circumstances, it certainly didn't make a good impression. In the future, our orders to show cause for these kinds of matters will specify that counsel must personally execute the written response, though that point really should not need to be stated.}</p>\n<p>In essence, counsel has told us that her \"computer generated searches\" misstated the law but that she didn't mean to mislead the court when she filed those misstatements. We will take her at her word about her intentions. But what counsel seems to imply\u2014that since the substance of the analysis in her brief wasn't necessarily wrong, her misstatements are not an issue we should be overly concerned about\u2014is simply unacceptable. Indeed, we are deeply troubled by this brief and by this attorney's response.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-8360466\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>The judges on this panel have, collectively, served for over fifty years as judicial officers. We have over a hundred years of experience as members of the Florida Bar. Before becoming appellate or trial judges, we practiced in state and federal courts in a wide variety of cases throughout the State of Florida. None of us can recall an instance when an attorney accidentally submitted a completely fabricated case as a legal authority to a court of law\u2014not until the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we're finding this problem arising more and more frequently&hellip;. When a lawyer cites imaginary legal authorities to our court as if they were law, we are compelled to refer that lawyer to the Bar because of the professional rules of conduct. [The court did indeed do so here. -EV]</p>\n<p>It doesn't take much moral imagination to understand why. As judges, we rely on attorneys to ethically represent their clients. We expect that representation to be zealous, honest, and competent. Indeed, lawyers owe the courts and their clients a duty to practice with competence and candor. By signing an appellate brief, a lawyer certifies that he or she has read the document and that to the best of the lawyer's knowledge, information, and belief there are \"good grounds to support the document.\"</p>\n<p>These ethical requirements are not excused simply because a computer program generated a faulty or misleading legal analysis. Nor is it an excuse that the attorney did not intend to mislead the court. \"To state the obvious, it is a fundamental duty of attorneys to <em>read</em> the legal authorities they cite in appellate briefs or any other court filings to determine that the authorities stand for the propositions for which they are cited.\"</p>\n<p>Obviously, that didn't happen when Ms. McLane filed this answer brief. Instead, counsel \"fundamentally abdicated\" her duty to the court and her client when she submitted this filing without verifying that the three cases cited in her brief said what she claimed they said. Accordingly, it is our duty to refer this matter to the Florida Bar to proceed as it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p>We are publishing this aspect of the case with the hope that it will remind attorneys that technological advances do not dispense with ethical obligations&hellip;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2025/12/11/self-represented-plaintiff-files-lawsuit-court-spots-ai-hallucinated-citations-in-defense-lawyers-filings/\">Self-Represented Plaintiff Files Lawsuit, Court Spots AI-Hallucinated Citations\u2014in Defense Lawyer&#039;s Filings</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

Trump</em> might not initially appear to share very much in common. Yes, they both involve President Donald Trump, but the former is about the president's purported authority to <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/09/25/scotus-is-now-poised-to-overrule-humphreys-executor-a-1935-precedent-limiting-presidential-power/\">fire the heads</a> of federal agencies at will, while the latter is about the president's purported authority to <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/06/on-tariffs-it-was-gorsuch-vs-trump-at-scotus/\">unilaterally impose tariffs</a>. Totally different legal issues, right?</p>\n<p>Well, yes and no. Trump's name may dominate the headlines, but both cases are also about the actions of Congress. Or perhaps it might be better to say that both cases are about the <em>in</em>actions of Congress; about how Congress has relinquished its lawmaking power over many years both to the executive branch and to the executive-ish federal agencies who wield what a <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/07/01/when-the-supreme-court-blessed/\">notable jurist</a> once <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1486648801467404451&amp;q=humphrey%27s+executor&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33\">called</a> \"quasi-legislative\" authority. In other words, both cases are about the separation of powers.</p>\n\n<p>The framers of the U.S. Constitution famously divided power among three branches of government so that, as James Madison explained in <a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/jay-the-federalist-gideon-ed#\"><em>Federalist</em> 51</a>, the \"constituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of keeping each other in their proper places.\" The constitutional separation of powers was absolutely vital, Madison argued, because \"ambition must be made to counteract ambition.\"</p>\n<p>Notice the key assumptions on which this argument rests: Madison assumed that each branch would seek to enlarge its powers; but he also assumed that each branch would jealously <em>guard</em> its powers from being seized by the other branches.</p>\n<p>President after president after president has certainly behaved as Madison assumed. But what about Congress?</p>\n<p>Consider the constitutional authority \"To declare War,\" which is granted exclusively to Congress via Article 1, Section 8. Yet Congress has officially done nothing in response to Trump <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/03/trump-says-his-armed-conflict-with-drug-traffickers-does-not-involve-hostilities/\">carrying out</a> repeated <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/06/24/trumps-unconstitutional-act-of-war/\">acts of war</a> without even the slightest hint of congressional authorization. When an ambitious president meets a supine Congress, what's left of the separation of powers?</p>\n<p>What's left is the third branch of government. Madison <a href=\"https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/01-12-02-0126\">described</a> the proper role of the judiciary as being \"an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive.\"</p>\n<p>I know what some of you are thinking, and you're right: The Supreme Court has undeniably failed to perform that judicial duty on many occasions. But there are some estimable past examples worth remembering, and emulating, today.</p>\n<p>In 1935, the Supreme Court weighed the fate of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA), which President Franklin Roosevelt had championed as \"the most important and far-reaching legislation ever enacted by the American Congress.\" Among other things, the NIRA placed unprecedented lawmaking power in the hands of the president.</p>\n<p>Yet \"such a sweeping delegation of legislative power\" cannot be reconciled with the Constitution, declared Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8998960440123298467&amp;q=schechter+poultry+corporation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33\"><em>Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</em></a>. \"Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President to exercise an unfettered discretion to make whatever laws he thinks may be needed or advisable for the rehabilitation and expansion of trade or industry.\"</p>\n<p>The Court's <em>Schechter</em> ruling was 9\u20130, which meant that even the <a href=\"https://reason.com/2010/03/19/louis-brandeis-partial-justice/\">Progressive legal hero</a> Justice Louis Brandeis lined up against Roosevelt. In fact, shortly after the decision came down, Brandeis personally delivered a blunt message to White House lawyers Tommy Corcoran and Ben Cohen. \"This is the end of this business of centralization,\" Brandeis said to them, \"and I want you to go back and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything.\"</p>\n<p>By enforcing the non-delegation doctrine (and other venerable constitutional principles) in <em>Schechter</em>, the Supreme Court did its part to enforce the separation of powers. And the Court did so, it is worth noting, even though the legislative branch had voluntarily surrendered some of its powers to the president.</p>\n<p>That same judicial solution to the intertwined problems of executive overreach and congressional abdication is still an option today. Or at least it is still an option if the current Supreme Court is prepared to do its job.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/11/a-judicial-solution-for-presidential-overreach-and-congressional-abdication/\">A Judicial Solution for Presidential Overreach and Congressional Abdication</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

In plastics, hydrogenolysis can make it easier to convert items such as grocery bags and food containers into different products. While exciting, this process is often slowed down by inefficient catalysts (which are meant to speed up hydrogenolysis).</p>\n<p>This is where the University of Delaware comes in. A research team has taken a commonly used catalyst in plastic hydrogenolysis and made it more porous, allowing the \"reaction to flow more easily,\"\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1099293\">per</a>\u00a0the team's first author. This simple fix \"enhances conversion of plastic waste into liquid fuels more quickly and with fewer undesired byproducts than current methods,\" in the words of the researchers' press release.</p>\n<p>The development could provide an answer to one of society's most pressing problems. While plastic has provided several benefits to key industries, its\u2028pollution is widespread and is now\u2028showing up in unprecedented places,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00279-8\">including the floor of the Arctic Ocean</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plastic-bag-found-bottom-worlds-deepest-ocean-trench/\">the bottom of the Mariana Trench</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-human-brain-may-contain-as-much-as-a-spoons-worth-of-microplastics-new-research-suggests-180985995/\">even human brains</a>.</p>\n<p>As a result, Americans increasingly support steep measures to curb this waste. A February 2025\u00a0<a href=\"https://usa.oceana.org/reports/nearly-8-in-10-u-s-voters-support-national-policies-that-reduce-single-use-plastic-foam/\">poll</a>\u00a0from the ocean conservation group Oceana found that 80 percent of registered voters favor state and local policies to reduce\u2028single-use plastic foam. This tracks closely with the results from a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/blogs/sustainability-works/posts/what-do-americans-think-about-plastic-waste\">2024 World Wildlife Fund poll</a>, which found that over two-thirds of Americans support either placing a fee on or banning single-use plastics.</p>\n<p>Governments, in turn, are using this public dissatisfaction to consolidate more power; <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/environment-and-natural-resources/state-plastic-bag-legislation\">eight states and several cities</a> have banned single-use plastic bags, and others have outlawed plastic straws. California (which also has a plastic bag ban) has gone a step further and\u00a0<a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-sues-exxonmobil-deceiving-public-recyclability-plastic\">filed</a>\u00a0a lawsuit against ExxonMobil for allegedly making false claims about the recyclability of its plastic products.</p>\n<p>The University of Delaware announcement could make it harder for governments to justify top-down measures like these, but the research team still has to conduct additional R&amp;D and further refine its catalyst before it can find an industrial partner. Luckily, the university isn't alone in its mission to turn plastic waste into something valuable. Mexican startup Petgas is operating a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC5048T5IJo\">pilot plant</a>\u00a0to convert styrofoam and other hard plastic into high-octane gasoline and diesel. The company claims that its fuel burns cleaner than conventional gasoline due to a lower sulfur content. Canadian startup Aduro, meanwhile, has created a regenerative\u00a0<a href=\"https://adurocleantech.com/hpu\">chemical recycling process</a>\u00a0to upcycle common plastic waste into usable products. It\u00a0<a href=\"https://investors.adurocleantech.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/Aduro-Clean-Technologies-Advances-Demonstration-Plant-Program-Begins-Global-Site-Selection-Project/default.aspx\">hopes to scale up its technology</a>\u00a0in the near future.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/11/plastic-pollution-to-practical-power/\">These Researchers Are Turning Plastic Waste Into Fuel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://reason.com\">Reason.com</a>.</p>\n",

It\u2019s not just the wonky economists debating the merits of his article; The\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/29/poverty-line-green/\">Washington Post</a>, CNN (News Central), FOX Business (Charles Payne), and social media are also critiquing it.</p>\n\n<p>Michael uses the official poverty line calculation and what he deems the \u201cMathematical Valley\u201d to help his readers better appreciate why affordability is becoming a hot topic.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/Economic-Reversion-To-The-Mean-e.jpg?itok=YGke1vM4\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/Economic-Reversion-To-The-Mean-e.jpg?itok=YGke1vM4\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"1b08c283-8677-4879-8108-685cf7fbb731\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"281\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/Economic-Reversion-To-The-Mean-e.jpg?itok=YGke1vM4\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-poverty-line\"><strong>The Poverty Line</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Per Michael Green:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>But there was one number I had somehow never interrogated. One number that I simply accepted, the way a child accepts gravity.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The poverty line.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I don\u2019t know why. It seemed apolitical, an actuarial fact calculated by serious people in government offices. A line someone else drew decades ago that we use to define who is \u201cpoor,\u201d who is \u201cmiddle class,\u201d and who deserves help. It was infrastructure\u2014invisible, unquestioned, foundational.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>This week, while trying to understand why the American middle class feels poorer each year despite healthy GDP growth and low unemployment, I came across a sentence buried in a research paper:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe U.S. poverty line is calculated as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I read it again. Three times the minimum food budget.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I felt sick.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This article summarizes Michael Green\u2019s perspective and opposing arguments regarding the poverty line. Bear in mind, as you read on, that there is no \u201cright\u201d poverty line. However, what Michael Green has successfully done is ignite a conversation about the large number of Americans who feel left behind economically and repeatedly raise affordability as a key political issue.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-1963-poverty-line-benchmark\"><strong>The 1963 Poverty Line Benchmark</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Green\u2019s analysis centers on the poverty line, which was established in the early 1960s by Mollie Orshansky. The original formula she developed was simple:\u00a0<strong>take the cost of a basic basket of food for a family, multiply it by three (on the assumption that food accounted for about one-third of a household\u2019s budget), and use that as the poverty threshold.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Her benchmark was then adjusted for inflation each year, but the underlying assumptions about household spending and needs haven\u2019t been updated since. Per Green:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Orshansky\u2019s food-times-three formula was crude, but as a\u00a0<strong>crisis</strong>\u00a0threshold\u2014a measure of \u201ctoo little\u201d\u2014it roughly corresponded to reality. A family spending one-third of its income on food would spend the other two-thirds on everything else, and those proportions more or less worked. Below that line, you were in genuine crisis. Above it, you had a fighting chance.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notably, Green emphasizes that Orshansky\u2019s poverty line served as a threshold. Those with incomes beneath this threshold were in crisis.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-orshanky-s-poverty-line-is-outdated\"><strong>Orshanky\u2019s Poverty Line Is Outdated</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Green emphasizes the items we spend money on, and their costs compared to food prices have changed significantly since then. For example, he points out:</p>\n\n<ul><li>\n\t<p>Housing costs as a percentage of income rose significantly.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Cell phones didn\u2019t exist.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Healthcare costs have become the most significant expense for most families.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A second income became a necessity for many families after the formula was devised, leading to increased childcare expenses.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>He also notes rising college and transportation costs.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><p>Simply, feeding a family no longer constitutes a third of total family budgets.\u00a0 To wit, he states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Housing now consumes 35 to 45 percent. Healthcare takes 15 to 25 percent. Childcare, for families with young children, can eat 20 to 40 percent.</em></p>\n\n<p>Michael Green\u2019s punchline:</p>\n\n<p><em>Which means if you measured income inadequacy today the way Orshansky measured it in 1963, the threshold for a family of four wouldn\u2019t be $31,200.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>It would be somewhere between $130,000 and $150,000.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>What does that tell you about the $31,200 line we still use?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It tells you we are measuring starvation.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-green-s-data-analysis\"><strong>Green\u2019s Data Analysis</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Green supports his theory with a basic family budget based on national averages. He applies it to a family earning the median household income of $80,000. The results, as we share below, cast significant doubt on the value of the current $31,200 poverty line. Furthermore, they argue that at least half of the nation is \u201cliving in deep poverty.\u201d Per Green:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I wanted to see what would happen if I ignored the official stats and simply calculated the cost of existing. I built a Basic Needs budget for a family of four (two earners, two kids). No vacations, no Netflix, no luxury. Just the \u201cParticipation Tickets\u201d required to hold a job and raise kids in 2024.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Using conservative, national-average data:</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Childcare: $32,773</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Housing: $23,267</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Food: $14,717</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Transportation: $14,828</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Healthcare: $10,567</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Other essentials: $21,857</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Required net income: $118,009</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Add federal, state, and FICA taxes of roughly $18,500, and you arrive at a required gross income of $136,500.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The graph below shows the cumulative price growth for $1,000 across many of the spending items Michael Green identifies above. As shown, except for transportation prices, all the others have significantly outpaced food prices. Thus, to Green\u2019s point, a poverty line based on a steady price-consumption relationship for these goods and others in relation to food prices has become grossly ineffective.</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/consumer-prices-scaled.jpg?itok=yBAy13pC\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/consumer-prices-scaled.jpg?itok=yBAy13pC\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"98a827f0-1c56-446d-a450-3f25630d1dff\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"333\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/consumer-prices-scaled.jpg?itok=yBAy13pC\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-hedonics\"><strong>Hedonics</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Hedonics is a statistical method used by the BLS in the CPI report to distinguish pure price changes from changes in product quality and how those changes impact value.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if a new laptop offers twice the performance at the same sticker price as an old one, hedonics treats that as a quality improvement and will record an effective price decline. Supporters say it prevents overstating inflation as products improve. In contrast, critics argue that it can understate inflation and relies on modeling choices that are impossible to validate.</p>\n\n<p>Green is a critic. As we share below, he uses landline telephones and smartphones to make his point:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>To function in 1955 society\u2014to have a job, call a doctor, and be a citizen\u2014you needed a telephone line. That \u201cParticipation Ticket\u201d cost $5 a month.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Adjusted for standard inflation, that $5 should be $58 today.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>But you cannot run a household in 2024 on a $58 landline. To function today\u2014to factor authenticate your bank account, to answer work emails, to check your child\u2019s school portal (which is now digital-only)\u2014you need a smartphone plan and home broadband.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The cost of that \u201cParticipation Ticket\u201d for a family of four is not $58. It\u2019s $200 a month.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Green states that food prices, not hedonics, are the only primary factors used to compute the CPI for food. In his calculations, the rate of inflation across many other CPI items greatly exceeded the CPI\u2019s reported rate, in part due to faulty hedonics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-mathematical-valley\"><strong>Mathematical Valley</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Michael Green introduces what he calls a \u201cmathematical valley.\u201d This idea illustrates a trap within the American economic system. The valley symbolizes the area where working families earn enough to lose government benefits but not enough to cover the actual cost of middle-class economic stability.</p>\n\n<p>As families move from poverty into the lower middle class\u2014usually earning between about $40,000 and $100,000\u2014they lose access to safety net programs like food stamps, housing subsidies, or Medicaid. Still, their wages don\u2019t keep up with the rising costs of housing, healthcare, childcare, and transportation. As a result, climbing the economic ladder can actually make families worse off financially because the loss of benefits outweighs the income gains.</p>\n\n<p>This Valley creates a perverse incentive to stay poor or near-poor, traps millions in financial insecurity, and fuels widespread cynicism among the working poor who feel punished for trying to get ahead.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-green-s-summary\"><strong>Green\u2019s Summary</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The Orshansky poverty line is based on the amount required to cover a minimum food budget times three. Since she developed her formula in 1963, the price of food has tracked below the broad CPI inflation rate. At the same time, many essential items have grown faster than food prices. To wit, food-at-home expenditures currently account for only 5 to 7 percent of spending, not the 33% assumed by Orshansky.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, because food prices are used as the basis for calculating the poverty line instead of a broader range of essential expenses, which have increased much more than food prices, the $31,200 poverty line is significantly understated. Additionally, the Mathematical Valley diminishes some incentives to earn more, thus resulting in affordability issues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"h-arguing-against-green\"><strong>Arguing Against Green</strong></h2>\n\n<p>While Michael Green makes a strong case that the poverty rate in this country is much higher than we think, and that affordability is becoming a hot topic, other opinions on Green\u2019s article are worth considering. We summarize a few of them below.</p>\n\n<ul><li>\n\t<p>Child Care Costs Exaggerated: While childcare is costly, it isn\u2019t part of most budgets once their children are past the age of four or five.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Stuff is also cheaper: Green harps on things we buy that are more expensive, but some necessities, like clothing and electronics, are more affordable.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Real incomes are rising. While a good argument, it raises questions about whether CPI is a good indicator of actual costs.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>What is the poverty line? To quote Alex Tabarrok of George Mason via the Washington Post:\u00a0<em>\u201cHe takes the poverty measure \u2014 and then turns it around and turns it into a middle-class measure,\u201d Tabarrok said. \u201cWhat do you need to be comfortable or thriving or middle class? Then, of course, you get a much bigger number. But to think that we today are living in some hellish landscape compared to our parents and even our grandparents is just a complete distortion of reality.\u201d</em></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"h-our-take-summary\"><strong>Our Take- Summary</strong></h2>\n\n<p>There isn\u2019t a single inflation rate or poverty line. We live in a diverse country with many different regional economies. Also, families have unique needs and desires that can\u2019t be summarized in one number. That said, no matter the poverty line, many American households are struggling.</p>\n\n<p>Remember when Obama ran on \u201cChange\u201d? He was followed by Trump, who ran twice on a similar message. The economic system remains broken for many Americans, and they are voicing concerns about affordability in election polls and sentiment surveys. Look at the graph below. According to the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment is at its lowest point since at least 1960!</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/consumer-sentiment_0.jpg?itok=dQDQy5uZ\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/consumer-sentiment_0.jpg?itok=dQDQy5uZ\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"f70935d9-4027-4633-96f7-ed3d4a1c9a70\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"274\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/consumer-sentiment_0.jpg?itok=dQDQy5uZ\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Of course, diagnosing the affordability problem and fixing it are two different things. But it\u2019s hard to fix the problem without being aware of it. Hopefully, Michael Green\u2019s article is raising enough debate and awareness on affordability to inspire action.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T16:05:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Thu, 12/11/2025 - 11:05</span>\n",

Elsewhere, <strong>the US threatened to sanction the International Criminal Court unless it promises not to prosecute President Trump.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In Latin America, the US seized an Iranian oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela after smuggling Nobel peace prize laureate Machado out of the country: she called for democracies to \u201cfight for freedom,\u201d which may not be metaphorical. In Brazil, a bill that could reduce ex-President Bolsonaro\u2019s prison time has advanced in Congress.

Rahm Emanuel is campaigning for the same thing in America.<p>I don't believe they're overly concerned with \"helping the kids\" unfortunately</p>\n",

I liked Reese Witherspoon's performance a lot, her Nicole was relatable and pleasant but her character does some dumbass decisions which were frustrating to watch and the main family is weird. The dad (William Petersen) is creepy, at one point he's checking out his daughter's teen best friend (Alyssa Milano in full vixen mode), and the stepmom (Amy Brenneman) calls her stepdaughter a bitch because she came iin late. Not to mention, when the new boyfriend gets invited to the home, the stepmom is in a bikini, getting awfully close to her stepdaughter's boyfriend. Those plot threads made me wonder if the movie was going to say the family was problematic but it was like Cape Fear, left unresolved. \n\nMark Wahlberg committs himself to playing a psychotic meathead who is dangerously obsessed with Witherspoon, at one point he masturbates her during a roller coaster ride. \n\nIt's not as thrilling or exciting as Fatal Attraction because the movie drags a lot and then it turned into a home invasion movie. \n\nWitherspoon is good and Milano is fun in a small but important part. The parents were too weird. Wahlberg does a good job in playing a psycho though he makes it too obcvious. Right from the start, you know he's nutso.",

though we did not expect a dividend cut, many investors had asked about the potential of one into earnings. <strong>Gross and net leverage moved from 3.0x and 2.7x to 3.4x and 2.8x, respectively, following ORCL's $18bn issuance in October, with its debt balance growing to $108bn from $91bn last quarter</strong>, and its cash balance increasing from $10.4bn to $19.2bn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then, the stock selloff accelerated during the earnings call when the company shocked investors - who clearly have lost their appetite for ridiculous capex spending plans at a time when the entire AI space is in flux -\u00a0<strong><u>by raising its CapEx projection for 2026 an incremental $15B to $50BN</u> to build capacity for the $68B in new contracts booked in Q2.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%20capex%20proj.jpg?itok=w5DpiK8A\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%20capex%20proj.jpg?itok=w5DpiK8A\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c91e2e23-935f-4888-9c03-6d47bb963822\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"306\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ORCL%20capex%20proj.jpg?itok=w5DpiK8A\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>Adding insult to injury, Barclays wrote that \"<em>the FY26 capex number is higher than previously anticipated, <strong>and suggests upside risk to the 2027/28 guides.\u00a0</strong>\u00a0For context, the FY26 guide of $50bn is flat to current FY27 consensus.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>That's when the bottom fell off the stock as investors were promptly reminded of Barclays calculation from a month ago (when the bank downgraded ORCL bonds and recommended buying its CDS), that unless something changes, Oracle \"<strong>would run out of cash by the November 2026 quarter, implying substantial funding needs.</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>The only thing that changed is that the cash burn became even bigger.</p>\n\n<p>Which also means that the company's debt-funded needs will be even bigger, and it's why management on the call, <strong>went so far\u00a0as to emphasize its commitment to Investment Grade ratings </strong>(currently rated <strong>Baa2/BBB, </strong>meaning it can be notched lower just once before it goes junk and all hell breaks loose), while laying out a variety of different funding sources\u00a0including pu<strong>blic debt markets, bank markets, and private debt markets, as well as vendor financing and leasing models </strong>(unclear if going all in on <em>off balance sheet </em>gimmicks is what the market wants here, but we'll cross that bridge in time).</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/ratings%20history.jpg?itok=gEkzWpZz\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ratings%20history.jpg?itok=gEkzWpZz\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"0656e424-f212-4a6e-b665-2c5c7a7dbe0c\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"292\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ratings%20history.jpg?itok=gEkzWpZz\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p>The company also discussed scenarios where customers may supply their own chips to be installed in the data centers\u00a0(a \"Bring\u00a0Your\u00a0Own\u00a0Chips\" approach)\u00a0which can reduce capital intensity. Management added that it expects its funding needs to be less than $100bn, if not substantially less in some cases. We would take the over.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Goldman Delta-One head Rich Privorotsky dedicated half of his note this morning to Oracle, whose results were so shocking they offset the market's entire positive mood from the Fed's <em><strong>dovish </strong></em>cut, and sent futures tumbling as much as 1%, to wit:\u00a0</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m genuinely surprised and think a few had started to get more constructive\u2026 the idea that ORCL might use this report to alleviate some of the market concerns around spending and balance sheet. <strong>Last night was precisely what the market didn\u2019t want\u2026 disappointing performance and rapidly rising capex</strong>. We\u2019re back in the nexus of credit concerns and that explains the magnitude of the equity move. As I\u2019ve argued, <strong>the picks-and-shovels trade has become erratic\u2026 volatile\u2026 and without clear leadership. </strong>Flows have been migrating to broader pockets of the market and the leadership has been more pro-cyclical and in financials.\u00a0 Watch credit today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Going back to the latest note from Barclay's Keches, whose analysis was one of the catalysts to trigger the ORCL meltdown a month ago, this is how he summarizes the bigger picture:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our view on Oracle is unchanged and we <strong>reiterate our Underweight rating on the credit. </strong>We think it is important to call out that management answered the market and addressed the balance sheet rather explicitly on the earnings call. A commitment to IG ratings is arguably the most meaningful financial policy that ORCL has ever given (more so than the Cerner buyback cap/leverage target). While one could argue that keeping IG ratings is a minimum expectation at this point (\"<strong>how can you really fund this as a BB?\" </strong>is a very frequent and fair question), it is positive nonetheless. Framing the funding needs as being less than $100bn (or potentially much less) is also positive for credit in that it provides a goalpost.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Our concerns are that capex is running at a higher base in 2026 which we viewed as a less impacted year given the phasing of the revenue ramp being larger 2028/29. </strong>With 2027 consensus at $50bn, flat to the new 2026 guide, we continue to think there is <strong>upside to capex</strong>. To be clear, management is adjusting its approach and offering a \"BYOC\" option to customers which would reduce its capex (albeit from a potentially higher-than-expected base line). While this would ease the cash flow dynamics, we are unsure what it would mean for margins and earnings power if ORCL is no longer providing the hardware for certain customers.</p>\n\n<p>Net net, we see a mixed set of credit implications and maintain our Underweight rating. With spreads having rallied 15bp into the results, we expect earnings to be somewhat of a \"sell the news\" dynamic rather than a clean clearing event for bonds and CDS. <strong>We recommend buying 5y CDS (121/128bp pre-call); </strong>the company noted that it will consider bank financing as an option which suggests that <strong>hedging demand could increase, as could non-traditional demand if vendor financing activity picks up</strong>. The stock is also down ~10% post market (as of writing) which should weigh on spreads given the correlation of those products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The market listened: ORCL CDS is blowing up this morning, wider by about 17 bps, surpassing 140bps and at levels last seen during the global financial crisis.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><a data-image-external-href=\"\" data-image-href=\"/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%20CDS%20dec.jpg?itok=dxv_F2pw\" data-link-option=\"0\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ORCL%20CDS%20dec.jpg?itok=dxv_F2pw\"><picture><img data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"dc82b358-d606-4e60-839a-dc0f38d250a4\" data-responsive-image-style=\"inline_images\" height=\"259\" width=\"500\" class=\"inline-images image-style-inline-images\" src=\"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ORCL%20CDS%20dec.jpg?itok=dxv_F2pw\" alt=\"\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></picture></a></p>\n\n<p><em>Much more in the <a href=\"https://marketdesk.ai/library/browse/hhi6zBYuc0P\">Barclays FICC research </a>note available to pro subs.</em></p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T16:21:59+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Thu, 12/11/2025 - 11:21</span>\n",

How we get to a point where a documentary account of Diddy's criminal behavior gets produced by fellow rap mogul 50 Cent is quite convoluted. There's women involved, business interests, and competition mixed in, and maybe just a hint of gay panic.\n\nRegardless, 50 Cent has been open about his personal disdain of Diddy for years. That animus, and 50 Cent's well-known trollishness, makes it easy to dismiss the documentary out of hand as a hit job from one rapper against another. But is that actually the case?

Was he abusing the mother of his own children? Did he kidnap his assistant so they could try to murder Kid Cudi? The doc doesn't prove any of it, but simply posing the questions in this format is suggestive. Listen to that music, he's evil!\n\nIt's not that the speculation is out of bounds or raised recklessly, but more that none of it is backed by anything beyond your own trust of people's stories. Some of the people telling their stories now, like Kirk Burrowes and Aubrey O'Day, have been public about the abuse they suffered for years, though they've gone largely ignored until recently. Other tales of Diddy's behavior have mostly proliferated as rumors and conjecture, and are now being presented more forthrightly since Diddy's fame no longer offers him the same protection as before. In fact, Diddy's history of narcissism, violence, and greed runs so deep that in four parts, the doc still misses several notable instances of it, including Lil Kim's prison stint, the mismanagement of Mase and The Lox, and the time he choked out a UCLA football coach.\n\nAs a documentary, The Reckoning is basically just a well-produced version of a TMZ or 20/20 news report. The one thing that makes it truly worthwhile is the personal footage Diddy himself shot during the height of his court cases. Presumably Diddy had it filmed because, ever the marketer, he planned to make his own documentary should the rulings go in his favor. How Stapleton was able to get her hands on it is an interesting, open question, as the footage is very revealing of Diddy's nature, from yelling at his attorneys to get control of the courtroom narrative, to planning out ways to discredit one of his accusers, to him walking around Harlem shaking hands with the people and then privately announcing that he needs a scalding hot shower to get all that \"people\" off of him. It's a shame that such a revealing look at a famous sociopath risks being overshadowed by the ultimately irrelevant casting of the doc as just another point 50 Cent has scored in his beef with Diddy.\n\nSean Combs: The Reckoning is worth your time if for no other reason than to see the pattern of behavior laid out in detail. It's not exactly rigorous journalism, but particularly in Part 4, the harrowing stories of the people who have had their lives destroyed by Diddy really hit home. Especially telling is the testimony of two of the jurors from his criminal trial, who clearly regarded Diddy with some kind of favor. One man felt that Diddy and Cassie's relationship was tumultuous in a typical way, and seemed to lack empathy for a woman living a life of luxury while also getting the shit beat out of her. The other juror, a young woman, seemed enthralled by Diddy as a mogul and the architect of the music of her youth, magnetized by his celebrity and therefore hesitant to accept any framing of him as some kind of supervillain.\n\nI feel confident that if the hotel video of Diddy kicking Cassie and grabbing her by the hair was never leaked, the general public wouldn't have had much trouble dismissing her claims of abuse for many of the same reasons that the two jurors gave. The story would've been that Cassie was just after money, and if her claims were real then why she didn't say anything sooner, and all the rest of the nonsense people come up with to avoid believing survivors. Even in our present reality, where the video did get out, some are still quick to block out the idea that domestic violence often speaks to a violent nature that manifests in other ways too. If you've seen Diddy beat up his girlfriend and believe her when she says he sexually abused and humiliated her, why is it a stretch to think that he could do the same or worse to multiple people? Particularly when he has had the money and power to get away with anything for about 30 years now.\n\nThese are the better questions to come out of this documentary, rather than gossiping about two middle-aged rappers and what their issues are with each other. Certainly a Netflix documentary can't give the answers, but at least we can start asking them. And while 50 Cent's involvement can allow Diddy supporters to scapegoat someone and obscure the darker truth, we shouldn't allow them to.",

    "full_content": "University of Michigan head football coach Sherrone Moore was arrested Wednesday, hours after the school issued a statement announcing he\u2019d been fired for what was termed an \"inappropriate relationship with a staff member.\u201d\n\nDetails of exactly what crimes Moore, 39, is accused of committing remain vague at this time. According to The Athletic, cops in Pittsfield Charter Township, Mich., were summoned to the home of a \u201cfemale Michigan football staffer\u201d yesterday afternoon. The Pittsfield police issued a statement last night to ESPN and others, saying the officers were \u201cinvestigating an alleged assault\u201d at that address. Moore, who was not named in the statement, was subsequently arrested by police in the nearby town of Saline. The Athletic story says the arrest was part of the same assault investigation, and Moore was handed over to Pittsfield law enforcement.\n\nDefector\u2019s request to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for incident reports from Moore\u2019s arrest was denied. A Pittsfield police staffer told Defector earlier today that nothing beyond last night\u2019s statement will be issued. The officer declined to say if Moore is still in detention as of this morning, referring this reporter to Vinelink, a national online database of incarcerated individuals. A Vinelink search showed Moore remains in custody of the Washtenaw Corrections Division.\n\nThe rationale behind Moore\u2019s firing by the school is slightly more clear. A statement from Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel yesterday afternoon held that the school terminated his employment after an investigation of the coach found \u201ccredible evidence\u201d he\u2019d been in an apparently romantic relationship with a staff member.\n\n\u201cThis conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy,\u201d said Manuel, \u201cand U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\u201d\n\nMoore officially posted an 18-8 record in his two-plus seasons as head coach, which began when Jim Harbaugh left Michigan for the NFL amid a cheating scandal. Moore was given a three-game suspension last summer for his role in a robust sign-stealing scheme concocted by the Wolverines coaching staff that surfaced in 2023. He sat out two of those games this season and was due to finish the sentence in the first game of the 2026 season.\n\nMichigan is scheduled to face Texas in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl on New Year\u2019s Eve. Before Moore\u2019s arrest, the school announced that former Wolverines assistant Biff Poggi will be brought back as head coach for that game. The often-sleeveless Poggi played the same role during Moore's suspension.",

D\u00edaz's trumpet-melody entrance created a brand-new jock jam heard in stadiums nationwide, and it served as the most distinctive quality of the team's ballpark experience. While the Mets hope Devin Williams, their newest bullpen signing, will bounce back to the dominant form he showed in Milwaukee a couple years ago, losing your longtime closer is undeniably a destabilizing experience.\n\nWhat's worse? How about seeing your all-time home run leader in another team's uniform? Just a day after the D\u00edaz news, fans learned that first baseman Pete Alonso would be signing with, of all teams, the penny-pinching Baltimore Orioles. The word from the insiders is that the Mets were ultimately fine with letting him walk if they otherwise would have had to spend $155 million over five years, but his absence means that a non-playoff team from last season is going to have to find a way to replace 38 home runs, 41 doubles, and a 144 OPS+ across 162 games.\n\nIn a world where baseball has a salary cap and owner Steve Cohen has a finite amount of money, the choice to let other teams snatch these players would be defensible baseball moves. Nimmo-for-Semien was a calculated swap of players with divergent strengths. If D\u00edaz pitches like he did in 2024, and Williams pitches like he did in 2023, nobody will mind the switch. And the haters are already wondering if Alonso's deal is an ill-advised sequel to the Orioles' dreaded Chris Davis contract. They would be wrong, because Chris Davis is still getting paid, but it was clear in Alonso's free agency last winter and this winter that most of the league is very down on the thought that the slugger's skills will hold up in his 30s.\n\nIn this world, however, baseball doesn't have a salary cap, and Cohen is about to build a heavily lobbied-for casino next to his ballpark, so it feels fair for fans to ask him this question: Hey, instead of making us say goodbye to our favorite players, why not just pay them with some of that future slot-machine cash? I can't help but feel a little stupidly naive, being taken aback by roster movement in 2025, but as someone who fell in love with this specific era of the local baseball team, I do have to admit that I feel sad about how much the Mets will look like some other squad next year. Nimmo, despite that awful Christian rock walk-up song, was one of the Mets' most consistent hitters for 10 seasons. D\u00edaz's trumpets feel like the thing young Mets fans will best remember about their first trips to games decades from now. And I can't count how many times Alonso lifted me out of my seat by walloping a ball over the fence; I've definitely seen him hit more home runs live than any other player in my lifetime.\n\nThe way the Mets ended last season was excruciating, as the team played .400 ball over the final two months of the season to waste away an inspiring start. It makes sense if the mission is not to repeat what happened last summer, and as these players leave, there remain other talented options available for the wooing. Whatever happens, these transactions have ensured that there's no turning back\u2014that all the fans understand the 2026 season will be different than the one that came before. If it doesn't work, everyone will know exactly who to blame.",

    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/minneapolis-st-paul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minneapolis</a> has been at the center of national headlines in recent weeks over a massive fraud scandal that experts say will cost taxpayers over a billion dollars. Fox News Digital spoke to a former prosecutor who worked on one of the central cases in the controversy.</p><p>Former federal prosecutor Joe Teirab, who served nearly four years in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Minneapolis and briefly worked on the Feeding Our Future case, says the public still doesn\u2019t grasp the scale, speed, and simplicity of the fraud that unfolded, or how deeply government failures contributed to it.</p><p>\"I think you generally have a sense that your government is gonna be fighting for you and spending your money just generally okay, and that was absolutely not the case,\" Teirab told Fox News Digital.</p><p>\"The amount of fraud was rampant, it was staggering, and happened really, really quickly. Just over the course of a couple years, the amount of fraud that happened in Minnesota is maybe in excess or probably in excess of a billion dollars, and one of the main prosecutors in a lot of the fraud, the former acting U.S. attorney Joe Thompson, said the number was likely over two billion dollars. So that is what we're dealing with. It's a travesty that our hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being wasted away.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/minnesota-fraud-scheme-unearths-millions-luxury-property-cars-doj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>MN FRAUDSTERS BLEW TAXPAYER CASH ON LUXURIES OUT OF REACH FOR MOST AMERICANS, FEDS SAY</strong></a></p><p>The scheme that has garnered most of the national attention involved the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, which misappropriated $250 million in COVID-19 funds. But the fraud within various government agencies in Minnesota goes far deeper, Teirab explained. He asserted that the system was set up in a way that made it possible, and relatively simple, for various nonprofits to scam the government out of over $2 billion when it\u2019s all said and done.</p><p>\"When I was on the Feeding Our Future case, the big thing that jumped out to me was honestly how easy this fraud was to do,\" Teirab told Fox News Digital. \"I mean, these fraudsters were just saying that they were spending all this money on feeding kids, and they were just making up these PDFs, putting false names into Excel sheets. I could do that in five minutes on a computer if I had absolutely no conscience.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Teirab explained, the social services system in Minnesota was set up in a way where it was designed to fail.</p><p>\"So the bottom line of this scandal was this: that there were supposed to be these different organizations, like Feeding Our Future, they were supposed to be a sponsor of different food sites that would give out food to kids who purportedly need it,\" Teirab. \"And so this Feeding Our Future was supposed to be the watchdog of these food sites. But they were not doing that at all. They were basically getting kickbacks from these sites that were supposed to be giving up food. That was totally false. And they were ginning up the numbers and saying that they fed 3,000 kids a day when they actually maybe fed zero or maybe three kids.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/he-had-years-to-stop-this-gop-lawmakers-blast-walz-over-massive-minnesota-fraud-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>\u2018HE HAD YEARS TO STOP THIS\u2019: GOP LAWMAKERS BLAST WALZ OVER MASSIVE MINNESOTA FRAUD SCHEME</strong></a></p><p>The fraudsters, largely but not exclusively consisting of the city\u2019s Somali population, coordinated casually as they discovered how effortless government reimbursement could be, Teirab explained.</p><p>\"These people were chatting with each other, and figured out, hey, I can get this free money,\" Teirab said, while explaining that the fraudsters and over 70 people facing indictment were the main perpetrators but that government officials also deserve blame.</p><p>\"Tim Walz was responsible for putting into place the commissioners of the different departments who are allowing all this money to go out, and then you had Keith Ellison, who not only should have done something about stopping the fraud once he had a sense that things were happening, he should have started to investigate it, he now tries to say that he was working hand in hand with the federal government\u2026 absolutely false, lying about what he did, what he knew and when he knew it,\" Teirab said.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walz\u2019s</a> office, in a statement to Fox News Digital this week, said that the governor \"views addressing fraud as a top priority\" and touted his work over the last three years making \"systematic changes to state government\" to stop it, including hiring investigators, auditors, and law enforcement.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nutrition-programs-lawsuit-triggers-mn-education-dept-ease-oversight-opening-door-more-fraud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>HOW A SINGLE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM HELPED MINNESOTA\u2019S LARGEST FOOD-AID FRAUD SLIP PAST STATE WATCHDOGS</strong></a></p><p>\"The Governor has brought in an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs at the Department of Human Services (DHS) and created a specialized fraud fighting law enforcement unit at the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension,\" Walz\u2019s office said. \"He has installed new leadership at DHS with a single-minded focus on stopping fraudulent payments. Many of the changes have not been flashy or headline-grabbing, but rather just the hard work of building stronger safeguards throughout state government.\"</p><p>Teirab, who ran for <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Congress</a> in 2024, told Fox News Digital he takes issue with elected officials who have presided over the fraud situation, which has been developing and reported on since at least 2020, telling the public they are on top of it.\u00a0</p><p>\"On the Democrat side, they're trying to deflect and say it's not a big deal, or we were actually working with you the whole time, and we're taking this very, very seriously,\" Teirab said. \"And it's absolute hogwash.\"</p><p><strong>\"</strong>Tim Walz didn't do enough, Keith Ellison didn't do enough, and Ilhan Omar didn't do enough either, because she for sure knew what was going on. She was actually in one of the government\u2019s exhibits, I believe, in one of the trials,\" Teirab continued. \"She had one of her political victory parties at one of the main restaurants at the heart of the Feeding Our Future scandal in 2018. It's just ridiculous, and hopefully we should all come together and say this kind of fraud shouldn't happen.\"</p>",

After spending his first two years at a community college near his hometown, he <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/oklahoma-sooners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transferred to Oklahoma</a> and played there for two years.</p><p>Moore played in 14 games as with the Sooners, winning the Big 12 Championship in both seasons. In 2007, they defeated top-ranked Missouri in the Big 12 title game, but the Sooners lost the Fiesta Bowl both seasons.</p><p>Just one year after graduating from Oklahoma, Moore joined the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/louisville-cardinals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">coaching staff at Louisville</a> as a graduate assistant. He was promoted to a full-time assistant in 2012, becoming the team's tight ends coach.</p><p>Moore left to hold the same position at <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/central-michigan-chippewas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Central Michigan</a> in 2014 before also becoming the team's assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator in 2017. In 2018, he then landed in Ann Arbor to become the Wolverines' tight ends coach.</p><p>Moore was the tight ends coach through 2020 and was promoted in early 2021 to the team\u2019s co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach. Michigan was named the top offensive line in both 2021 and 2022, and with Jim Harbaugh running the show, the Wolverines were creeping back into a powerhouse, making the College Football Playoff both seasons for the first time.</p><p>Moore\u2019s first taste as a head coach came in 2023, when he became the acting head coach while Harbaugh served two separate three-game suspensions stemming from the sign-stealing scandal.

His first season was a disappointment, as Michigan went 8-5, but one of those wins was a huge upset as three-touchdown underdogs in Columbus against Ohio State.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ex-lsu-star-implores-michigan-star-transfer-amid-sherrone-moore-controversy\"><strong>EX-LSU STAR IMPLORES MICHIGAN STAR TO TRANSFER AMID SHERRONE MOORE CONTROVERSY</strong></a></p><p>Moore served a two-game suspension this season as the sign-stealing scandal investigation continued, and despite going 9-3 in the regular season, the school's winning streak against <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/ohio-state-buckeyes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ohio State</a> ended, and the Wolverines missed out on the playoff.</p><p>Moore was shockingly fired on Wednesday, and the University of Michigan quickly announced it found credible evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staffer. Shortly after, he was booked into the Washtenaw County Jail in Michigan.</p><p>Pittsfield police said they responded to a home as part of an assault investigation. Police said a suspect was taken into custody and that the incident does not appear to be random.

    "content": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/shedeur-sanders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shedeur Sanders</a> found fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. for the touchdown in Cleveland on Sunday to make it a 31-29 ball game, Browns fans were ecstatic, knowing a successful two-point conversation meant a tie game.\u00a0</p><p>Sanders, who started the last three games for <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cleveland-browns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Browns</a> in his rookie season, showcased his late-game savvy and kept his team in the contest up until the final play.\u00a0</p><p>But confusion, and bewilderment for some, was the reaction when Sanders wasn't seen under center on the two-point try. It was rookie running back Quinshon Judkins, who was in the wildcat formation as he does on occasion this season.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM</strong></a></p><p>The play ended up going unsuccessful, and the Browns fell to the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/tennessee-titans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tennessee Titans</a> with lots of what-if responses from experts and fans alike.\u00a0</p><p>Robert Griffin III, the FOX Sports analyst and former NFL quarterback who spent the 2016 season in Cleveland, has been vocal about how the Browns have treated Sanders since taking him in the fifth round. After seeing head coach Kevin Stefanski's decision to go with Judkins in the wildcat over Sanders, he believed it was pure \"coaching failure\" on his part.\u00a0</p><p>\"You have to be in touch with what\u2019s going on in the game, and the young man that gave you the best chance to win the game should\u2019ve been on the field in the most crucial point of the game. He wasn\u2019t and that\u2019s a coaching failure on their part,\" Griffin told Fox News Digital after helping USAA gift two military veterans with new vehicles before the 126th Army-Navy game this weekend.\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/shedeur-sanders-addresses-undergarment-rumors-after-viral-moment-browns-loss-it-did-look-like-that\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SHEDEUR SANDERS ADDRESSES UNDERGARMENT RUMORS AFTER VIRAL MOMENT IN BROWNS' LOSS: \u2018IT DID LOOK LIKE THAT\u2019</strong></a></p><p>The Browns were in a massive hole with about six minutes remaining in the contest, staring at a 31-17 deficit after a blocked punt set up a Titans field goal.</p><p>Sanders, though, never lost faith and was able to get into the end zone for his first rushing touchdown on the ensuing drive to make it a 31-23 ball game. Then, after a three-and-out by the Titans, he went seven plays in 1:40 to eventually find Fannin for the score with 1:03 remaining in the game.</p><p>At that point, Sanders had totaled his fourth touchdown of the game and his third passing score. He was 23-for-42 for 364 yards with an interception as well.</p><p>Griffin said the two-point conversion play Stefanski and offensive coordinator Tommy Rees had dialed up might have been the wildcat on the call sheet, but he thought they needed to look deeper into how they got to that point.</p><p>\"I think, from a coaching standpoint, you look at it and say, \u2018What are our best two-point plays? What have we practiced all week?\u2019 Most coaches go into a game with two to three two-point plays, and they were just at the point where that was the two-point play that was next on the call sheet,\" he explained. \"In that moment, I think you have to say to yourself this young man has four touchdowns, he\u2019s led us all the way back into this game and kept us in this game. We should not be taking him off the field. That, to me, was where the mistake was.</p><p>\"Every coach will tell you, \u2018You go down your sheet, you call the play, and you live with it.\u2019 But you have to be able to take the analytics out and say, \u2018All right, this is the best thing we can do in this moment.\u2019\"</p><p>Stefanski has been criticized for his handling of Sanders since joining a crowded Browns quarterbacks room when he arrived in Cleveland. Throughout the season, as the Browns have struggled for consistency at the position with Joe Flacco traded and Dillon Gabriel not finding consistent results, the call for Sanders grew louder by the week.</p><p>Sanders won his first career start in Las Vegas, a 24-10 victory over the Raiders, and Stefanski gave him praise for getting better by the week. He also said what Griffin suggested this past weekend, as Sanders will remain the team\u2019s starter the rest of the way.</p><p>But Stefanski\u2019s decision on Sunday with the two-point conversion only added fuel to those who believe Sanders is being set up to fail with the Browns.</p><p>Griffin noted no coach should make gameday decisions based on outside noise, but after balling out, he\u2019s confident that Sanders should\u2019ve been in for that crucial play.</p><p>Sanders has four more games left in his rookie season, starting with the Chicago Bears on the road in Week 15.</p><p><strong>HELPING THOSE WHO SERVE US</strong></p><p>Griffin was back in Baltimore, where he spent the remaining years of his NFL playing career, to show honor through action in the tradition of the annual Army-Navy Game by gifting two recycled rides with USAA, the official Salute to Service partner of the NFL.</p><p>Cryptologic Technician Petty Officer First Class Jamil Lewis, who is currently serving in the Navy, and veteran Patrick Huber, a specialist of the 116th Infantry Regiment, Army National Guard, were both surprised by Griffin with the brand-new vehicle at Inner Harbor in front of the USS Constellation.</p><p>Griffin, who comes from a military family himself with his mother and father serving in the Army, has long enjoyed his partnership with USAA and couldn\u2019t have been happier to help out with this.</p><p>\"I\u2019ve been so honored to partner with USAA. We\u2019ve been partnered together for the last 13 years, and I\u2019m a guy who likes to do genuine, authentic partnerships. Military brat, mom and dad both served in the Army. So, I\u2019m a \u2018Go Army, beat Navy\u2019 guy \u2014 31 years combined between them. To see the impact we\u2019ve been able to make over the last 13 years, doing things to make our military members know they\u2019re not forgotten, it does something for me,\" he explained. \"If it\u2019s doing something for me, it\u2019s doing something for these families we get to impact, to make their lives a little bit easier. It\u2019s not a free car. I say that because, yeah, they didn\u2019t have to pay money for it, but there was sacrifice for us and our freedoms to be able to get this type of treatment. We want them to know that, \u2018Hey, man, we appreciate you.\u2019\"</p><p>Griffin said that Huber, a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan, made sure to take a crack at him during their time together about the Washington Commanders, who the Baylor product was drafted by.</p><p>And Griffin also loved seeing Lewis\u2019 nine-year-old son, one of his five children, \"going ballistic\" when he realized what was happening.</p><p>\"They got a free car to the point where, 30 minutes after the event, he\u2019s still sitting in the passenger\u2019s side seat,\" Griffin said about Lewis\u2019 son.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s</strong></i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>\u00a0sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>\u00a0and subscribe to</strong></i><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>\u00a0the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

Gavin Newsom's approval to further the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts.",

    "content": "# [fantasyboxofficegame.com](http://fantasyboxofficegame.com)\n\n\n\nJust want to start off by stating that this is not a paid ad and this website is totally free to use.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I was looking for a way to get more nerdy about movies. I love fantasy football and had heard of some similar games centered around the box office, so I did some googling and found a post on reddit from u/Chris_Tennant saying that he had made a game that runs off of Google Sheets. I messaged him and we ended up chatting on discord and he said it was a work in progress but he was looking for people to play it and give feedback. So I put a couple leagues together, two leagues with my coworkers and one with some other r/movies mods, and long story short we had an absolute blast with it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris has been working on this thing like crazy since then and this last year he upgraded it from a Google Sheet to a \\[website\\](fantasyboxofficegame.com). It looks great and is really intuitive. This year I\u2019m running four leagues and it\u2019s been a wild year for the BO and anyone who follows the news will tell you it\u2019s only going to get more unpredictable. Here\u2019s how the game works.   \n  \n\n\n**The game consists of three drafts throughout the year, one every four months, in which you draft movies only for the coming four months. Jan-Apr, May-Aug, Sep-Dec.**\n\n\n\n**When you select a movie you take on the burden of 2.5x that movie\u2019s budget upon release.**\n\n\n\n**So if you pick a movie with a budget of 100mil, you get negative 250mil when that movie comes out and then gain the box office for its entire theater run as it happens.**\u00a0\n\n\n\n**There are essentially three different kinds of draft picks.**\n\n* **The Hit Pick. One movie chosen from the entire calendar year that you are betting on to make all the money. You only get one of these per year. You will probably want a major blockbuster.**\u00a0\n* **Seasonal Picks. 3-4 of these per draft, so 9-12 total. This will make up the bulk of your roster. You can adjust how many depending on how many people are in your league or whatever rules you want.**\u00a0\n* **The Bomb Pick. This is a pick that you think will** ***lose*** **a lot of money, and it goes to all of your opponents rosters instead of yours. You only get one of these per year and they are chosen during the first draft, much like the Hit Pick.**\u00a0\n\n  \nAs the movies on your roster release, you take on their negative budget and watch it slowly climb back up as it continues to make money. Here\u2019s what our current season looks like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytyge9jcol6g1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be324efdcbc56169cc020cb951cb4c1bbe09c8b5\n\n\n\nEach of those datapoints is clickable to see what movie release it is and you can see the numerical stats here (please do not roast me for picking Snow White, no Disney Live Action Remake had lost money before this):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f60anpkdol6g1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6592e4adcef2789259f7305b5371fa5028095a16\n\nWe have been playing this for two years now and the drafts are always so fun and unpredictable and there\u2019s a surprising amount of strategy to it. You don\u2019t always know budgets this far in advance so you have to gamble a bit on which studios are more conservative with their budgets and realistically how expensive movies look.   \n  \nSo get some friends together or organize a league here in the comments with other redditors. **It\u2019s totally free** and if you\u2019re a movie nerd like me then I can vouch that this really adds a lot of fun and investment to every release!",

He said the goalkeeper was only worried about the World Cup.\n\n\u201cLivakovic is a spectacular person, but he has a timeline with objectives different from Girona\u2019s,\u201d M\u00edchel said. \u201cHe needs to play for the World Cup, not for Girona. He told me this himself; he is a sincere person. He told me he didn\u2019t want to be here, that he wanted to play for another team because if he played with Girona, he wouldn\u2019t be able to play for another team.\u201d\n\nM\u00edchel said the 30-year-old Livakovic, who is on loan from Fenerbahce, told him he doesn\u2019t want to play because he wants to remain eligible to play for another club. Players can only play for two teams in a season and Livakovic already played for Fenerbahce.\n\nM\u00edchel said he wanted Livakovic to play a Copa del Rey match earlier this month but he refused to, forcing regular starter Paulo Gazzaniga to play with the flu and a high fever.\n\n\u201cRight now, I only have one goalkeeper available,\u201d M\u00edchel said. \u201cGazzaniga\u2019s commitment is beyond any doubt. Until the winter transfer window, I know we have a problem. And I am not defending my position but defending the goalkeeper who has been here for three years, which is Gazzaniga.\u201d\n\nM\u00edchel said he decided to make public what should have been a private matter because \u201cthe fans needed to know.\u201d\n\nGazzaniga has had an up-and-down season including a few embarrassing mistakes. It happened in the team\u2019s Spanish league opener and again on Sunday, when the Argentine goalkeeper\u2019s errors led to two Elche goals. One after he passed the ball straight to an opponent inside the area while trying to send it to a defender, and earlier he failed to make a routine save on an angled shot by the near post.\n\nGirona is 18th in the league standings, inside the relegation zone.",

It would replace the enhanced subsidies with a cash payment to eligible enrollees, to be placed in a Health Savings Account. The original Obamacare subsidies, distinct from the enhanced subsides, would remain in place.</p>\n\n<p>Schumer on Dec. 9 criticized the proposal as \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d</p>\n\n<h2>Enhanced Subsidies</h2>\n\n<p>The enhanced subsidies enacted in 2021 expanded eligibility for Obamacare, offering subsidies for wage earners well into the middle class.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The original Obamacare subsidies are open to people making between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. That equates to a household income of between $32,150 and $128,600 for a family of four.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The enhanced subsidies increased the amount of the subsidies, removed the income limit, and capped out-of-pocket premium payments at 8.5 percent of household income. Some low-income enrollees are eligible for plans with no premium payment under the coverage expansion.</p>\n\n<p>Obamacare enrollment more than doubled after the enhanced subsidies were introduced.</p>\n\n<h2>Standoff</h2>\n\n<p>Democrats pushed for a permanent extension of the enhanced subsidies early in the fall, refusing to authorize continued spending to fund the government until Republicans agreed to negotiate over this and other health-care-related proposals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Republicans refused to consider the extension during the shutdown.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The government shutdown, which lasted for 43 days, ended when eight Democratic Senators voted with Republicans to approve stopgap funding to reopen the government, but on the condition that their party be given a vote this month on extending the subsidies.</p>\n\n<p>Schumer revealed the Democrats\u2019 proposal for a three-year extension on Dec. 4.</p>\n\n<p>Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) released their plan on Dec. 8, and Republicans elected to present it for a vote alongside the Schumer plan on Dec. 11.</p>\n\n<p>Other plans have been proposed by Senate Republicans, by bipartisan groups of House members, and by the House New Democrat Alliance.</p>\n\n<h2>Compromise Seekers</h2>\n\n<p>The latest compromise proposal has been put forward by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), joined by a bipartisan group of House members.</p>\n\n<p>Fitzpatrick introduced a discharge petition that, if successful, could force the House to vote on his proposal. A discharge petition requires support from 218 House members.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Fitzpatrick plan would extend the enhanced premium tax credits through 2027 to insulate consumers from sudden rate increases</strong>. It includes some measures to check fraud by unscrupulous insurance brokers and rein in some practices of pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen in the prescription drug supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>The measure has the support of several moderate House members, including Reps. Jared Golden (D-Maine), Michael Lawler (R-N.Y.), Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Thomas Suozzi (D-N.Y.), and Robert Bresnahan (R-Pa.).</p>\n\n<p>The subsidies have taken on a sense of urgency as the Jan. 1 premium increases draw nearer. \u201cThis is personal to a lot of us because these are our friends and our neighbors that are losing sleep over this,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) applauded the effort, saying it seemed similar to a three-year ramp-down of the subsidies that he suggested.</p>\n\n<p>Tillis told The Epoch Times on Dec. 10 that any measure would need roughly equal support from both parties because hardliners on both sides would be likely to reject a compromise.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said, \u201cCompromise should never be a dirty word.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said:\u00a0\u201cThis should be a bipartisan. Let\u2019s get together and figure this out.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Josh Hawley, who has proposed no tax on health care premiums, deductibles, or copays, said lawmakers should explore every option for bringing down the cost of health care.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think it should be hard to go home and say to people whose premiums are doubling, \u2018You know, we just couldn\u2019t quite get it done,\u2019\u201d he said.</p>\n</div>\n      <span rel=\"schema:author\" class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><a title=\"View user profile.\" href=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" lang=\"\" about=\"https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\" typeof=\"schema:Person\" property=\"schema:name\" datatype=\"\" class=\"username\" xml:lang=\"\">Tyler Durden</a></span>\n<span property=\"schema:dateCreated\" content=\"2025-12-11T17:25:00+00:00\" class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">Thu, 12/11/2025 - 12:25</span>\n",

Hummel, a Purdue University legend who briefly played in the NBA before turning to broadcasting, reported from the Suns bench that coach Jordan Ott had spent the previous huddle telling Mark Williams to continue to \"win the race\" against his man every time. Hummel delivered his report while wedged next to the actor Austin Butler, whom play-by-play man Noah Eagle razzed Hummel for not knowing about before checking in with Derek Fisher from the Lakers bench.\n\nReporters on the bench, \"Roundball Rock,\" and the sonorous stylings of play-by-play guy Michael Grady are all new to the NBA's national broadcasts this season, the first campaign under the league's new TV contract. The 11-year deal represents the biggest change to national NBA broadcasts since 2002, when ESPN replaced NBC. For 22 seasons, national games were carried by ESPN and TNT, or, to put it in corporate conglomerate terms, networks under the Disney and Time Warner umbrellas.\n\nUnder the new deal, NBC is back, ESPN and partner network ABC are still around, and Amazon is making its NBA broadcasting debut. The latter, the fifth-most valuable company in the world, succeeded in entering into the business only after TNT's parent company, now known as Warner Bros. Discovery (after four name changes in the intervening period), filed suit against the NBA and reached a settlement. WBD's desperation to claw its way back into the deal, which is three times bigger than its predecessor and runs for two years longer, indicates that despite eternal crowing about ratings and worries about cord-cutting, live sports are still incredibly important to any company in the broadcasting business. Every major media company is trying to buy up more live sports rights.\n\nTo the basketball fan, the pressing matter in this season of change isn't corporate intrigue, but rather the aesthetic experience on offer from the new broadcasters. How do the games feel on Amazon and Peacock, and what are these networks doing differently? What is happening over at ESPN, which ended the last TV deal with a whimper? In other words, what is the state of the NBA on TV?\n\nI began this story with a clip from Peacock because NBC has the most games this year, and because NBC's broadcasts are breaking the most new ground. They are also retracing a lot of old ground. The network's broadcasts are chiefly associated with the NBA's Michael Jordan-era glory days, which the network often seeks to remind the viewer. That has taken the form of MJ: Insights to Excellence, interviews\u2014rather, an interview, singular, stretched across multiple broadcasts\u2014with Jordan himself, conducted by Mike Tirico, in which the Hall of Famer and Charlotte Hornets minority owner offers his perspectives on the love of the game (it's important), what he owes to the future of the sport (\"to be able to pass on messages of success and dedication\"), and load management (not a fan). Jordan isn't a particularly magnetic interview subject, and it's quite funny that NBC is stretching out one interview (they say they'll do more) to this extent, but his involvement does feel pretty cool.\n\nAs for the new ground, the clip from the Suns\u2013Lakers game that opened this story shows what Peacock is cooking and why it's cool. The broadcast was technically a three-man booth, though only Noah Eagle was sitting in the traditional spot along center court doing familiar play-by-play commentary. Fisher, in his first season as a broadcaster and coming along, and Hummel, in his eighth and really good at this, filled out the booth with reports from each team's bench as well as running color commentary. The dynamic totally works. The bench reporters offer the sort of unique insights you can only get from inside a huddle, and they also play a critical role in making the game feel more alive to the viewer.\n\nThere is a substantive difference between a color commentator telling you about a conversation they had with an assistant coach before the game and someone talking to you while sitting courtside, often right next to their subjects. Lakers games feel different in part because people as famous as Austin Butler are sitting courtside at them and not in, say, Charlotte. Conveying that on a broadcast\u2014in this case, from a seat beside the celebrity\u2014shows you something unique.\n\nNBC shows player introductions from within the arena, usually while the players introduce themselves directly to the camera. That stuff is cool, as are Jamal Crawford on the call; Maria Taylor and a trio of Real Hoopers on the pregame and halftime desk; and NBC's 1080p HDR picture quality, the result of a six-year transition over from SDR. Less cool are the baked-in gambling graphics on Peacock and the 11 p.m. Eastern start times for certain West Coast games. As a West Coaster myself, I actually like being able to watch basketball well past 10 p.m., though I understand that being asked to stay up past 1 a.m. is a totally different prospect, one that will undoubtedly prevent non-freaks from catching many second halves. Your mileage will undoubtedly vary on Reggie Miller.\n\nThe biggest innovation Amazon has made, in turn, is its outrageously spacious studio. It's 13,000 square feet, two stories high, and it features a full-LRED regulation-size halfcourt where analysts can draw up plays and explain the sinews of the game. Former TNT host Taylor Rooks leads a desk composed of several former players, an ensemble which isn't yet all that magnetic but is starting to hit its stride in the coverage I've watched. They aren't going for an Inside the NBA\u2013style comedy troupe thing, which is to their credit, because what Blake Griffin, Udonis Haslem, Steve Nash, and Dirk Nowitzki are collectively good at is explaining basketball. It's refreshing to see a studio show that can not only tell you about pindown actions but also, on the halfcourt, show how they work.\n\nAs befits the size of the studio and five-person desk, Amazon also has a huge group of contributors, including the great Zach Lowe and Tyrese Haliburton, moonlighting while he recovers from a torn Achilles tendon. The chemistry of the main desk hosts is still coming along, though hopefully that will improve the longer they work together.\n\nOn the court, Prime Video games feel like spruced-up TNT broadcasts. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and although Kevin Harlan has lost a step as a play-by-play commentator, he still has the best voice in the business. An interesting thing Prime Video does is rotate its play-by-play announcers and color commentators, opting for variety over the traditional system of fixed pairings. Dwyane Wade's work in the booth is super impressive, as viewers of Olympic basketball would have noticed last summer, and it's great to have Brent Barry back in broadcasting after years in various league front offices and coaching staffs.\n\nPrime Video's big showcase is currently underway, as it holds broadcast rights for the NBA Cup. Eric Collins and Dell Curry, who work together on local Charlotte Hornets broadcasts, called Tuesday's Miami Heat\u2013Orlando Magic game. While I am not personally a fan of Collins's histrionics or his tendency to mispronounce names\u2014e.g.: calling Goga Bitadze \"Gogo\"\u2014he certainly does bring a level of energy to the games that nobody else can match. But neither he nor Harlan are my favorite broadcaster working right now. That would be Michael Grady.\n\nA friend who is a diehard Minnesota Timberwolves fan put me on to Grady last spring, insisting we watch the Wolves' first-round playoff games on the local broadcast instead of the national because he needed to hear Grady on the call. After some initial grousing (I wanted to listen to Mark Jones), I ended up grateful for it. Grady makes every game better. After spending some time working the sideline for the Brooklyn Nets, Grady joined the Minnesota broadcast booth just three years ago; under the new deal, he is the only person who calls games for both NBC and Prime, a sign of how quickly his star has risen.\n\nThe first thing that pops is Grady's smooth baritone. The second is that he never over-talks, instead letting the game attest to itself in the right moments and seeking to supplement the viewer's eyes rather than replace them. The third is his signature call: \"CASH!\" Grady is a good contrast with Collins, whom people like for his histrionic style. If Collins makes the game better it is through exaggeration, which is not necessarily a bad thing: You want performers to perform, though this style's effectiveness is in how it adds to the game experience. Grady, on the other hand, does not add so much as enhance. The shape of the basketball game remains the same in his hands, only polished to its finest sheen. To me, Grady is the best announcer working in the business.\n\nAmazon has had a lot of help along the way from ESPN. Prime Video has two huge game trucks (\"Magic\" for the West Coast, \"Bird\" for the East) that assist in its broadcasts, and ESPN often shares them with Amazon. Per Sports Video Group, \"ESPN has weekly meetings with NBA technical, the NBA, and Amazon to share notes, work through venue and team idiosyncrasies, and decipher plans for sharing mobile units and/or generators.\"\n\nESPN has caught a lot of shit, including from us, for its NBA broadcast work over the past few years. The network shook up its lead broadcast booth this year, replacing Doris Burke with Tim Legler, who knows ball and is generally good at communicating it. The problem with that booth was third man Richard Jefferson, who's still there, and who remains a rough watch and listen. Aside from him, though, ESPN still knows how to broadcast a game. Mercifully, atrocious analyst Bob Myers has left the company, and the crew of veterans still around (Ryan Ruocco, Dave Pasch) are solid and mostly worth listening to. Sadly, Jones is slipping out of this category.\n\nThere's a strain of discourse that contrasts Steve Nash drawing up\u2014and acting out!\u2014pick-and-roll coverages on Prime Video against Stephen A. Smith hawking an allegedly rigged Israeli solitaire casino game on ESPN, and concludes that ESPN does not care about basketball, unlike these other guys. Not to defend the Worldwide Leader's honor, but I think that diagnosis is overcooked. ESPN's Finals coverage was disastrous, but also very different in feel from its bread-and-butter NBA broadcasts. There's a lot of good stuff in there still, and Legler is one of the best at triangulating the ex-player experience with the trajectory of the modern game. It is striking, however, how barren ESPN's roster is. With Grady excelling at NBC and Amazon, ESPN no longer has the premier booth in the game, nor does it have an obvious rising star. Instead it has Richard Jefferson. That's the bigger problem, not the malignant omnipresence of Smith.\n\nFor the fan, the hope here is that the three broadcast partners can push each other, borrowing the best stuff along the way. As much as I like hearing \"Roundball Rock,\" the best part of what has been a great national broadcast experience so far is its variety. To be clear, I mean \"great national broadcast situation\" only in a strict televisual sense, as dealing with three separate streaming apparatuses is a huge pain in the ass, tracking which of them has the games on a given night is annoying, and having to learn their respective quirks\u2014e.g.: Amazon's volume button does not mute when you click it; ESPN's iPhone app will pop up the settings page asking you to turn alerts on literally every time you open it\u2014is tedious. But the basketball experience has been great. And we made it through this story without once talking about ratings!",

The more the government decides what people can and can't want to do the worse the potential gets when they make mistakes.

    "content": "What are your thoughts on BlackBerry\n\nI saw BlackBerry just recently and I must say, I really did enjoy the film. Essentially the film is about the BlackBerry line of mobile phones and how it achieved success and failed and stars Jay Baruchel as Mike Lazardiis, Glenn Howerton as Jim Ballsillie, and Matt Johnson as Doug Fregin, who also directed the film.\n\nSo with the film, I thought it was well-written, great set designs, and was very fun to watch and the performances were good.\n\nI must say, I was really shocked at how good the performances were and I felt Glenn Howerton stole the show as Jim Balsillie, who basically came in and whipped Mike &amp; Doug into shape and make sure that the Company didn't go bust the moment he came in. I was impressed &amp; surprised with Jay Baruchel in the role of Mike, who while not as cutthroat as Jim, has enough knowledge in tech and knows what is behind it to actually get inventors interested in it &amp; in the end, grows somewhat of a spine. Matt Johnson was also good as Doug. I must say, I felt was an idiot for most of the film. He is great with the tech side of things, but on the business side of things, he is very clueless and I felt he really didn\u2019t understand the stakes that were involved. (which I find funny as in real life, his character was at least aware enough to sell his stock and become one of the richest men in the world). Also to mentioned, Michael Ironside was great in the small role he had and stole the scenes he was in.\n\nOverall, the film was just an enjoyable experience and probably one of the better of a Social Network rip-offs.",

    "content": "A few years ago, near the end of 2022, I first started watching Star Trek TNG to try and fill the Mass Effect shaped whole a rerun of the trilogy had left me with.\n\nWhile I had never really considered exploring Star Trek shows before (since unlike Star Wars, Star Trek was never really that big here in Italy) I then ended up starting a watching routine that finished about a year later after I watched all of TNG, its movies from Generations to Nemesis and all of Picard\u2019s three seasons.\n\nI definitely fell in love with the genre, so a few months ago I tried watching DS9, but man, do not crucify me for it\u2026 The available video quality really discouraged me (which is a shame because DS9 looks awesome otherwise).\n\nSo, hoping they would remaster DS9 and Voyager in the meantime (*yeah, fat fucking chance*) after Picard I looked at modern Trek again, hoping I could find something as entertaining and well written as the TNG era but without having to compromise on a modern viewing experience.\n\nPicard S2 was definitely a warning sign of what modern Trek has to \"offer\" (thank you Terry Matalas for correcting that with S3), so I took one hard look at Discovery before saying \u201c*yeeeah, no*\u201d as soon as I saw the Klingons\u2019 redesign.\n\nThen I remembered about The Orville.\n\nI thought that sure, it is more of a parody than an actual sci-fi show (I was dead wrong here), and sure, it isn\u2019t really Star Trek\u2026 But I also thought that it was so very \"close enough\" that I was willing to give it a chance. And am I glad I did.\n\nI am relatively new to Star Trek, but I honestly feel like this is what its modern version is supposed to look like and be. \n\nS1 isn\u2019t perfect, but if you give the show a chance its second and third seasons not only will grant you the best optimistic TNG like show you could wish for in this dark, dark days but also a great sci-fi show.\n\nYes, it starts out as sort of as a \"spoof\" of TNG and yes, it owes to TNG pretty much everything it becomes (which is so much more than a comedy), but that is not a bad thing. \n\nIt works more like a spiritual successor to that era of Star Trek. You cannot help but love it, if you loved its main source of inspiration.\n\nAll this to say, that if you do love Star Trek you should NOT sleep on The Orville just because it is \"Star Trek by Seth McFarlane\". Frankly, that should be an incentive, if nothing else.  \n\n\n\nPS: I\u2019ve seen Starfleet Academy\u2019s trailer. As I said, I am relatively new to Star Trek, but I gotta ask to the experts: who is that show for? The CW's refugees?",

    "content": "<div class=\"FeatureByline\">\n           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 11, 2025</br>\n           <hr>\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1049982/\">Maintainers Summit</a>\n</div>\nThe first topic of discussion at the 2025 Maintainers Summit has been in\nthe air for a while: what role \u2014 if any \u2014 should machine-learning-based\ntools have in the kernel development process?  While there has been a fair\namount of controversy around these tools, and concerns remain, it seems\nthat the kernel community, or at least its high-level maintainership, is\ncomfortable with these tools becoming a significant part of the development\nprocess.\n<p>\nSasha Levin began the discussion by pointing to <a\nhref=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/aTYmE53i3FJ_lJH2@laps\">a summary</a> he had sent to the\nmailing lists a few days before.  There is some consensus, he said, that\nhuman accountability for patches is critical, and that use of a large\nlanguage model in the creation of a patch does not change that.  Purely\nmachine-generated patches, without human involvement, are not welcome.\nMaintainers must retain the authority to accept or reject machine-generated\ncontributions as they see fit.  And, he said, there is agreement that the\nuse of tools should be disclosed in some manner.\n<p>\n<!-- middle-ad -->\n<h4>Just tools?</h4>\n<p>\nBut, he asked the group: is there agreement in general that these tools\nare, in the end, just more tools?  Steve Rostedt said that LLM-generated\ncode may bring legal concerns that other tools do not raise, but Greg\nKroah-Hartman answered that the current developers certificate of origin\n(\"Signed-off-by\") process should cover the legal side of things.  Rostedt\nagreed that the submitter is ultimately on the hook for the code they\ncontribute, but he wondered about the possibility of some court ruling that\na given model violates copyright years after the kernel had accepted code\nit generated.  That would create the need for a significant cleanup effort.\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1049977/\"><img\nsrc=\"https://lwn.net/images/conf/2025/ossjp/SashaLevin-sm.png\" alt=\"[Sasha Levin]\"\ntitle=\"Sasha Levin\" class=\"rthumb\"></a>\n\nTed Ts'o said that people worry about the copyright problems, but those\nsame problems exist even in the absence of these tools.  Developers could,\nfor example, submit patches without going through the processes required by\ntheir employer \u2014 patches which, as a result, they have no right to submit.\nWe do not worry about that problem now, he said, and it has almost never\nactually come up.  Jiri Kosina said that these tools make code creation\neasy enough that the problem could become larger over time.\nDave Airlie asked whether it makes sense to keep track of which models\npeople are using.  But, he said, any copyrighted code put into a patch by\nan LLM is likely to have come from the kernel itself.\n<p>\nLevin mentioned that there had been some ethical concerns raised about LLM\nuse and its effects on the rest of the world.  Arnd Bergmann said that it\ncould make sense to distinguish between which types of models are in use.\nRunning one's own model locally is different from using a third party's\ntool.  \n<p>\nLinus Torvalds jumped in to say that he thought the conversation was overly\nfocused on the use of LLMs to write code, but there has not, yet, been much\nof that happening for the kernel.  So any problems around LLM-written code\nare purely hypothetical.  But these tools <i>are</i> being used for other\npurposes, including identifying CVE candidates and stable-backport\ncandidates, and for <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1041694/\">patch review</a>.  Andrew\nMorton, Torvalds said, had recently shown an example of a machine-reviewed\npatch that was \"<q>stunning</q>\"; it found all of the complaints that\nTorvalds had raised with the patch in question, and a few more as well.\n<p>\nAlexei Starovoitov said that, within Meta, automated tools have been\nproducing good reviews about 60% of the time, with another 20% having some\ngood points.  Less than 20% of the review comments have been false\npositives.  Jens Axboe added that he has been testing with older patches\nand seeing similar results.  He passed one five-line patch with a known\nproblem to three human reviewers, and none of them found the bug.  But the\nautomated tool did find the problem (a reversed condition in a test);\n\"<q>AI always catches that stuff</q>\".\n<p>\nChristian Brauner asked the group how many people use LLMs for coding;\nabout four developers raised their hands.  Shuah Khan expressed concern\nabout access to LLMs; most of this work is being done behind corporate\nwalls.  Ts'o said that he has been using the review prompts posted Chris\nMason, originally written for Claude, with Gemini, with generally good\nresults and at a relatively low cost.\n<p>\nTorvalds, though, pointed out that developers have long been complaining\nabout a lack of code review; LLMs may just solve that problem.  They are\nnot writing code at this point, he said, though that will likely happen\nat some point too.  Once these systems start submitting kernel code, we\nwill truly need automated systems to review all that code, he said.\n<p>\n<h4>Proprietary systems</h4>\n<p>\nKonstantin Ryabitsev said that he had tried using some of these systems,\nbut found them to be far too expensive; he also was worried about depending\non proprietary technology.  Brauner said that this usage had to be\nsupported by employers, or perhaps the Linux Foundation could attempt to\nprovide an automated review service.  Ts'o said that the expense depends on\nhow the system is used.  One can pull in the entire kernel, using a lot of\ntokens; that will be expensive.  The alternative is to create a set of\nreview rules, reducing the token use by a factor of at least five.  Khan\nrepeated that not all developers will have equal access to this technology.\n<p>\nMark Brown was concerned about requiring submitters to run their patches\nthrough proprietary tools; some will surely object to that.  Axboe\nsuggested that the review tools should be run by subsystem maintainers, not\nsubmitters.\n<p>\nI pointed out that, 20 years ago, the kernel community abruptly lost access\nto BitKeeper, highlighting the hazards of depending on proprietary tools.\nIf the kernel community becomes dependent on these systems, development\nwill suffer when the inevitable rug-pull happens.  At some point, the cost\nof using LLMs will have to increase significantly if the companies behind\nthem are to have a chance at reaching their revenue targets.\n<p>\nTorvalds, though, called that concern a \"<q>non-argument</q>\".  We do not\nhave those tools today, he said; if they go away tomorrow, the community\nwill just be back where it is now.  Meanwhile, he said, we should take\nadvantage of the technology industry's willingness to waste billions of\ndollars to get people to use these tools.  Even if it only lasts a couple\nof years, it can help the community.\n<p>\nStarovoitov said that he loves the reviews that the BPF community gets from\nthe LLM systems.  They ask good questions even when the reviews are wrong.\nEven better, developers respond to the questions, despite the fact that\nthey are answering a bot; those answers can be used to help the models\nlearn to do better in the future.  But he acknowledged a recent three-day\noutage caused by some problems at GitHub; it \"<q>felt devastating</q>\".  He\nwas just waiting for the service to come back, since it does a better job\nof reviewing than he does.\n<p>\n<h4>Disclosure</h4>\n<p>\nLevin shifted the discussion to disclosure requirements.  There have been\nproposals for an Assisted-by tag that would name the specific tool used;\nshould that tag be required for all tools, or just for LLMs?  Torvalds said\nthat he would like to see links to LLM-generated reviews, but that there is\nno need for a special review tag.  Ts'o agreed, saying that people need to\nlook at the reviews to determine whether they make sense, but he pointed\nout that a lot of reviews are not posted publicly.

    "full_content": "<div class=\"FeatureByline\">\n           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 11, 2025</br>\n           <hr>\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1049982/\">Maintainers Summit</a>\n</div>\nThe first topic of discussion at the 2025 Maintainers Summit has been in\nthe air for a while: what role \u2014 if any \u2014 should machine-learning-based\ntools have in the kernel development process?  While there has been a fair\namount of controversy around these tools, and concerns remain, it seems\nthat the kernel community, or at least its high-level maintainership, is\ncomfortable with these tools becoming a significant part of the development\nprocess.\n<p>\nSasha Levin began the discussion by pointing to <a\nhref=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/aTYmE53i3FJ_lJH2@laps\">a summary</a> he had sent to the\nmailing lists a few days before.  There is some consensus, he said, that\nhuman accountability for patches is critical, and that use of a large\nlanguage model in the creation of a patch does not change that.  Purely\nmachine-generated patches, without human involvement, are not welcome.\nMaintainers must retain the authority to accept or reject machine-generated\ncontributions as they see fit.  And, he said, there is agreement that the\nuse of tools should be disclosed in some manner.\n<p>\n<!-- middle-ad -->\n<h4>Just tools?</h4>\n<p>\nBut, he asked the group: is there agreement in general that these tools\nare, in the end, just more tools?  Steve Rostedt said that LLM-generated\ncode may bring legal concerns that other tools do not raise, but Greg\nKroah-Hartman answered that the current developers certificate of origin\n(\"Signed-off-by\") process should cover the legal side of things.  Rostedt\nagreed that the submitter is ultimately on the hook for the code they\ncontribute, but he wondered about the possibility of some court ruling that\na given model violates copyright years after the kernel had accepted code\nit generated.  That would create the need for a significant cleanup effort.\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1049977/\"><img\nsrc=\"https://lwn.net/images/conf/2025/ossjp/SashaLevin-sm.png\" alt=\"[Sasha Levin]\"\ntitle=\"Sasha Levin\" class=\"rthumb\"></a>\n\nTed Ts'o said that people worry about the copyright problems, but those\nsame problems exist even in the absence of these tools.  Developers could,\nfor example, submit patches without going through the processes required by\ntheir employer \u2014 patches which, as a result, they have no right to submit.\nWe do not worry about that problem now, he said, and it has almost never\nactually come up.  Jiri Kosina said that these tools make code creation\neasy enough that the problem could become larger over time.\nDave Airlie asked whether it makes sense to keep track of which models\npeople are using.  But, he said, any copyrighted code put into a patch by\nan LLM is likely to have come from the kernel itself.\n<p>\nLevin mentioned that there had been some ethical concerns raised about LLM\nuse and its effects on the rest of the world.  Arnd Bergmann said that it\ncould make sense to distinguish between which types of models are in use.\nRunning one's own model locally is different from using a third party's\ntool.  \n<p>\nLinus Torvalds jumped in to say that he thought the conversation was overly\nfocused on the use of LLMs to write code, but there has not, yet, been much\nof that happening for the kernel.  So any problems around LLM-written code\nare purely hypothetical.  But these tools <i>are</i> being used for other\npurposes, including identifying CVE candidates and stable-backport\ncandidates, and for <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1041694/\">patch review</a>.  Andrew\nMorton, Torvalds said, had recently shown an example of a machine-reviewed\npatch that was \"<q>stunning</q>\"; it found all of the complaints that\nTorvalds had raised with the patch in question, and a few more as well.\n<p>\nAlexei Starovoitov said that, within Meta, automated tools have been\nproducing good reviews about 60% of the time, with another 20% having some\ngood points.  Less than 20% of the review comments have been false\npositives.  Jens Axboe added that he has been testing with older patches\nand seeing similar results.  He passed one five-line patch with a known\nproblem to three human reviewers, and none of them found the bug.  But the\nautomated tool did find the problem (a reversed condition in a test);\n\"<q>AI always catches that stuff</q>\".\n<p>\nChristian Brauner asked the group how many people use LLMs for coding;\nabout four developers raised their hands.  Shuah Khan expressed concern\nabout access to LLMs; most of this work is being done behind corporate\nwalls.  Ts'o said that he has been using the review prompts posted Chris\nMason, originally written for Claude, with Gemini, with generally good\nresults and at a relatively low cost.\n<p>\nTorvalds, though, pointed out that developers have long been complaining\nabout a lack of code review; LLMs may just solve that problem.  They are\nnot writing code at this point, he said, though that will likely happen\nat some point too.  Once these systems start submitting kernel code, we\nwill truly need automated systems to review all that code, he said.\n<p>\n<h4>Proprietary systems</h4>\n<p>\nKonstantin Ryabitsev said that he had tried using some of these systems,\nbut found them to be far too expensive; he also was worried about depending\non proprietary technology.  Brauner said that this usage had to be\nsupported by employers, or perhaps the Linux Foundation could attempt to\nprovide an automated review service.  Ts'o said that the expense depends on\nhow the system is used.  One can pull in the entire kernel, using a lot of\ntokens; that will be expensive.  The alternative is to create a set of\nreview rules, reducing the token use by a factor of at least five.  Khan\nrepeated that not all developers will have equal access to this technology.\n<p>\nMark Brown was concerned about requiring submitters to run their patches\nthrough proprietary tools; some will surely object to that.  Axboe\nsuggested that the review tools should be run by subsystem maintainers, not\nsubmitters.\n<p>\nI pointed out that, 20 years ago, the kernel community abruptly lost access\nto BitKeeper, highlighting the hazards of depending on proprietary tools.\nIf the kernel community becomes dependent on these systems, development\nwill suffer when the inevitable rug-pull happens.  At some point, the cost\nof using LLMs will have to increase significantly if the companies behind\nthem are to have a chance at reaching their revenue targets.\n<p>\nTorvalds, though, called that concern a \"<q>non-argument</q>\".  We do not\nhave those tools today, he said; if they go away tomorrow, the community\nwill just be back where it is now.  Meanwhile, he said, we should take\nadvantage of the technology industry's willingness to waste billions of\ndollars to get people to use these tools.  Even if it only lasts a couple\nof years, it can help the community.\n<p>\nStarovoitov said that he loves the reviews that the BPF community gets from\nthe LLM systems.  They ask good questions even when the reviews are wrong.\nEven better, developers respond to the questions, despite the fact that\nthey are answering a bot; those answers can be used to help the models\nlearn to do better in the future.  But he acknowledged a recent three-day\noutage caused by some problems at GitHub; it \"<q>felt devastating</q>\".  He\nwas just waiting for the service to come back, since it does a better job\nof reviewing than he does.\n<p>\n<h4>Disclosure</h4>\n<p>\nLevin shifted the discussion to disclosure requirements.  There have been\nproposals for an Assisted-by tag that would name the specific tool used;\nshould that tag be required for all tools, or just for LLMs?  Torvalds said\nthat he would like to see links to LLM-generated reviews, but that there is\nno need for a special review tag.  Ts'o agreed, saying that people need to\nlook at the reviews to determine whether they make sense, but he pointed\nout that a lot of reviews are not posted publicly.

This program isnt any better than the Miami \"Convicts\" of the old days, Michigan just likes to wear a \"blue collar\" jacket instead. \n\nConnor stallions, the infractions, Harbaugh leaving, Sherrone Moore, weirdo staff members like Weiss collecting images of women on work computers, and now even more allegations that half this coaching staff with families is doing questionable and morally gray stuff out in the town with students at bars and stuff. You got half of michigan fans in CFB subreddits claiming such as well on their own message boards and forums with pieces of evidence. \n\nNot to mention how long this all has been covered up for and attempted to be covered up for by the higher administration. The administration has known for several months and waited until after signing day and after the season to see if it was worth revealing this depending on how well the season and recruiting was going to lock in recruits and not suffer a penn state situation. \n\nUSC had our title stripped because Matt Leinart was taking interpretive dance theory as a class and Reggie Bush's fam was getting paid by an agent on the side, meanwhile Michigan's head coach is going straight to horny jail with a staff equally as horny and messing around, plus the Connor stallions crap, and nothing will happen to them but a hey man! Dont do that again. \n\nHarbaugh didn't just happen to leave at \"the perfect time and opportunity\". Like Pete Carroll, he saw the writing on the wall and bounced before having to watch his empire crumble with him at the throne. \n\nAt this point im inclined to believe every single cheating allegation levied against Michigan both on the field and off the field.\n\nIts a blessing in disguise though, Sherrone was never the guy. He was the equivalent of an NFL bridge until you get your actual guy. Michigan fans, I feel bad for you. You didn't do anything wrong, you just got screwed over by some dirt bag coaches and staff.
