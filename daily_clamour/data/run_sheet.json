      "full_content": "The cruelty that has been heaped on Charlie Kirk\u2019s widow, Erika, since his assassination three months ago has been unrelenting.\n\nFirst it was leftist ghouls cheering on his cold-blooded murder, in front of a crowd of 3,000 people at the first stop of his Turning Point USA \u201cAmerican Comeback Tour\u201d outdoors on the campus of Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.\n\nThe ghouls gloried in the death of the young father of two, mimicked the instant the bullet hit his throat, created T-shirts with his image and gushes of blood to celebrate the moment his voice was silenced.\n\n\u201cThis is righteous anger, because this is not OK. It\u2019s not healthy. This is a mind virus,\u201d Erika Kirk told Harris Faulkner on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOutnumbered\u201d of her ghoulish tormentors. Getty Images\n\nIt could not have been a more public execution.\n\nHe was shot dead on livestream, with hundreds of cellphones capturing graphic footage of the atrocity. \u00ad\n\nEvery member of the TPUSA team was traumatized by what they saw that day and their unsuccessful efforts to save his life.\n\nSadists and freaks recorded TikToks with millions of views, dancing on his grave.\n\nGoFundMes popped up to help the alleged killer, 22-year-old furry lover Tyler Robinson, who is facing 10 felony counts in Utah, including aggravated murder.\n\nBy now, conservatives know the left is a vile death cult full of broken people tipped over the edge by social media.\n\nBut what has been far worse than the leftist haters are right-wing-adjacent grifters and nuts pushing wicked conspiracy theories about Charlie\u2019s murder, pointing the finger at his colleagues, friends and even Erika herself.\n\nThese fantasies have been peddled primarily by former prominent TPUSA luminary Candace Owens on her hit podcast, which gets more than 40 million views for her wildest rants.\n\nShe has claimed Israeli Mossad agents, men in maroon shirts, the US military, Egyptian planes, Jewish donors and the French government are somehow complicit.\n\nShe endlessly plays videos of that awful day and theorizes about the \u201cexit wound\u201d or lack thereof.\n\nJust asking questions?\n\nWorst of all, she torments Charlie\u2019s widow by suggesting in a disingenuous \u201cjust asking questions\u201d way that Charlie was \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the people who loved him most.\n\nHer proof?\n\nA dream.\n\n\u201cI had a very vivid dream whereupon Charlie told me that he had been betrayed.\u201d\n\nShe has thrown suspicion on Charlie\u2019s pastor, his chief of staff, his chief operating officer, his spokesman, the camera guy, you name it.\n\nEvery week, Post columnist Miranda Devine sits down for exclusive and candid conversations with the most influential disruptors in Washington on \u2018Pod Force One.\u2019 Subscribe here!\n\nShe plays clips of their reactions the moment Charlie was shot and claims they looked guilty.\n\nShe is suspicious that TPUSA supposedly won\u2019t give her their footage of Charlie\u2019s murder that she laughably claims she needs so she can \u201cdebunk all these internet conspiracies.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about this is wrong,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI helped to build that organization, so I am almost the perfect person to discern what is normal and what is abnormal.\u201d\n\nShe also claims: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to be on the side of goodness and truth no matter what the cost is.\u201d\n\nHer daily tantalizing drip feed of absurdities cashing in on her former friend\u2019s death has made her millions of dollars.\n\nThe more bizarre and dishonest the lies, the more clicks, because that\u2019s the way the online ecosphere works.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Erika Kirk erupted in a controlled demolition of Owens and all who amplify her toxicity.\n\n\u201cThis is righteous anger, because this is not OK. It\u2019s not healthy. This is a mind virus,\u201d she told Harris Faulkner on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOutnumbered\u201d program in an appearance to promote the publication of her husband\u2019s final book, \u201cStop, in the Name of God.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want justice for my husband, for myself, for my family, more than anyone else out there. But here\u2019s my breaking point on that. Come after me, call me names, I don\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cCall me what you want, go down that rabbit hole, whatever.\u201d\n\nGet Miranda\u2019s latest take Sign up for Devine Online, the newsletter from Miranda Devine Thanks for signing up!

Check out more newsletters\n\nErika\u2019s courage\n\n\u201cBut when you go after \u2026 the people that I love, and you\u2019re making hundreds and thousands of dollars, every single episode going after the people that I love [saying] because somehow they\u2019re in on this? No.\u201d\n\nWith courage and graceful intensity, she explained why she so far has remained silent in the face of ever more cruel clickbait: \u201cMy silence does not mean that somehow, Turning Point USA, and all of the handpicked staff that loved my husband \u2014 and my husband loved them \u2014 is somehow in on it.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Erika turned to the camera and pointedly addressed the conspiracy theorists:\n\n\u201cJust know that your words are very powerful, and we are human. My team are not machines, and they\u2019re not robots. We have more death threats on our team and our side than I have ever seen \u2026 What are we supposed to do? Relive that trauma all over again?\u201d\n\nThe best part was that Erika never mentioned the name of the woman who TPUSA insiders say is afflicted by \u201cfirst wife\u201d syndrome.\n\nThey say Owens is consumed by jealousy that Erika has been appointed CEO of TPUSA, following Charlie\u2019s express wishes to the board and colleagues and captured on video.\n\n\u201cShe is a woman scorned,\u201d one TPUSA insider said of Owens.\n\n\u201cShe was iced out of TPUSA \u2026 She was not close to Charlie \u2014 he kept her at arm\u2019s length. He knew the best tack on her was to keep her on ice \u2026 She was not invited to Charlie\u2019s wedding.\u201d\n\nCharlie continued to exchange light, friendly text messages with Owens to try to stop her attacking TPUSA.\n\nThere are a lot of people who could inherit Charlie\u2019s mantle as the conservative Christian on campus rescuing young people\u2019s souls.\n\nBut Owens is the last person he would have chosen.\n\nShe was associated with TPUSA for only two years and resigned/was pushed out in 2019 after being pilloried for a comment that seemed to excuse Adolf Hitler.\n\nAfter Charlie\u2019s death, she expressed the fantasy that \u201cthe band maybe was going to get back together.\u201d\n\nAt first, Charlie\u2019s family and colleagues decided to ignore the bile.\n\nBut last week, his inner team, who have been running his podcast since he died, finally invited Owens to come on the show and clear the air.\n\nThey have spent all week negotiating with her but say she keeps making excuses for why she can\u2019t go to their studio in Phoenix, including that there is a \u00adlocal \u201ccartel\u201d that wants to assassinate her.\n\nShe has also claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 who is suing her for defamation over her prolonged claims that his wife, Brigitte, is really a man \u2014 has ordered her assassination.\n\nOf course, she claims there\u2019s an Israeli in the assassin squad.\n\nIn any case, next Tuesday, \u201cThe Charlie Kirk Show\u201d will debunk all the nonsense, with or without Owens.",

A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people,\u201d the president later posted on his Truth Social, sharing a link to the website for applicants.\n\n\u201cSO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!\u201d\n\nThe card purchases are revamping the backlogged and cumbersome EB-5 visa program that had awarded permanent legal status to foreigners who invest up to $1 million in US businesses.\n\nAs many as 250,000 foreigners were still waiting for their approvals as part of that program as of February this year.\n\nCongress authorized the visa program in 1990 to place investments of differing levels based on the region of the US. Some rural areas only required around $800,000 as opposed to $1 million.\n\nThe foreign investors also had to show they could create at least 10 American jobs with the funds.\n\nJust 135,518 EB-5 visas have been issued in its 25-year history, according to data from the Invest In the USA (IIUSA) trade association.\n\nPresident Donald Trump displays a signed executive order on gold card visa in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, September 19, 2025. REUTERS\n\nTrump expects that \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d in revenue could result \u2014 and that top business leaders like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook have celebrated the gold card solution.\n\nOriginally set at a a $5 million price tag, the card has also been touted by Trump and his officials as a way of balancing the federal budget with more revenue.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a line for EB-5 of 250,000 right now. 200,000 of these gold green cards [at $5 million] is $1 trillion to pay down our debt,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in February.\n\nThe nation\u2019s debt currently stands at more than $38 trillion.",

Jasmine Crockett (TX-30) for people to find proof that Democrats were \"invoking violence,\" and it couldn't have backfired on her more spectacularly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs RedState reported, Crockett made headlines on Tuesday when she officially announced her run for a Senate seat in the great state of Texas.\n\nREAD MORE: New: Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett Officially Launches U.S. Senate Bid\n\nCrockett's Trainwreck Announcement Underscores Why She's Not Ready for Prime Time\n\nIn response, numerous clips have resurfaced of the crazy things the Democrat representative has said. In one example, Crockett made comments during her appearance in October on The Breakfast Club radio show (which features host Charlamagne tha God), following Charlie Kirk's assassination a month earlier.\n\nApparently, Crockett was so unaware of the massive numbers of Democrats who have incited violence against those on the right, that she apparently thought it would be hard to prove. But if you are a RedState reader, you know all too well that the proof is everywhere.\n\nDuring the lawmaker's appearance on the show, she said the following (It comes at the 7:12 minute mark):\n\n\"I challenge somebody to go and find a clip of a Democrat invoking violence.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, the GOP has accepted the challenge, sharing a short video on X on Wednesday with many clips of the vile comments, made by Democrats, calling for violence.\n\nWatch:\n\nJasmine Crockett: \u201cI challenge somebody to go and find a clip of a Democrat invoking violence.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere you go @JasmineForUS pic.twitter.com/zalak7LqJx \u2014 GOP (@GOP) December 10, 2025\n\nHere's just a sampling of what you hear in the video.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY-8): \"We're going to fight it in the courts. And we are going to fight it in the streets.\"\n\nDem Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA-14): \"When they go low, we're going to bury them below the Capitol. That's what we're going to do.\"\n\nDem Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-7): \"There needs to be unrest in the streets as long as there's unrest in our lives.\"\n\nDemocrat California Governor Gavin Newsom: \"We're walking down a damn different path. We're fighting fire with fire. And we're going to punch these sons of [....] in the mouth.\"\n\nDemocrat Rep. Derek Tran (CA-45): \"Fight back, punch back and make sure they stay down, and you know what, kick them when they're down. Because they deserve it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Crockett is featured in the clip several times, with her own invocations for violence.\n\n\"I think that you punch,\" Crockett said. \"I think you punch. I think you're okay. You okay with punching.\"\n\n\"We are not only going to punch you back, but we are going to knock you out,\" she added. \"Not only are we going to punch back, but we about to beat you down.\"\n\nSEE: Jasmine Crockett's Woman of the People Shtick Blows Up After Release of Latest FEC Filings\n\nALSO: Did Republicans Actually Trick Jasmine Crockett Into Running for Senate?\n\nThis is just more proof that those inciting/invoking violence against the other side of the political aisle are the Democrats and those on the left, not the other way around.\n\nCrockett's self-own might be funny if it weren't so disgusting and damaging to our country.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Do you enjoy RedState\u2019s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

      "full_content": "The \u201cTrump Gold Card\u201d will generate billions of dollars for the federal government, but will not expand the huge inflow of migrants into the careers sought by skilled American graduates, says Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\n\u201cThe program is part of the already approved visas,\u201d Lutnick told a reporter during a White House press event, adding:\n\nThe average green card holder earns less than the average American. So they were more likely to be on the dole and be on our assistance programs than average Americans. The idea is from President Trump, he wants to raise it, bring the best people into America. So same visas, but now just full of the best people.\n\nThe fast-track ticket to citizenship can be bought by vetted individuals for $1 million or purchased by a company for $2 million. The company can reuse the ticket for a different person every five years.\n\nTrump touted his sale of citizenship by saying it would raise funds for the government, as well as provide specific foreign workers sought by Fortune 500 companies. \u201cThe companies will be very happy, and I know Apple will be very happy,\u201d Trump said, adding:\n\nPeople are just buying them, somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card: Companies are going to be able to go to the Wharton School of Finance, Harvard, MIT, wherever you may get your [foreign] students, any school, and you\u2019re able to buy the card and keep that person in the United States, actually, so there\u2019s certainty, because a lot of I\u2019ve heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I\u2019ve heard from a lot of people, [including] some of the [technology exectives] at this table that essentially, in the United States, you can\u2019t keep the [foreign] student. You can\u2019t hire [foreign] people from the best colleges, because \u2026 you could say there\u2019s no way of guaranteeing that they\u2019re able to stay in the country.\n\nHowever, employers already have multiple ways to hire foreigners who graduate from U.S. universities.\n\nFor example, roughly 400,00 foreign students and graduates are already being allowed to stay and work in the United States for one to three years. That work-permit program is dubbed the Occupational Practical Training program, and is widely used by foreign managers to hire ethnic peers for careers, so excluding a large number of American graduates from professional careers.\n\nMany of those OPT workers subsequently get picked for the H-1B program, which annually grants new long-term work visas to 120,000 foreign graduates each year. After several more years, H-1B workers can get green cards.\n\nThe OPT program was created by George W. Bush\u2019s deputies, without approval from Congress.\n\nIn September, Trump signed a proclamation slamming the visa programs that keep roughly 2.5 million foreign graduates in jobs needed by American professionals.\n\nThe voter reaction to the announcement was mixed:\n\n\u201cWe want the invaders out, not in,\u201d said Rickey Halliday.\n\n\u201cPlease tell me how this is America First? How is selling citizenship to foreigners good for our country and culture? \u201d asked Kelly McCarty. \u201cAmerican citizenship shouldn\u2019t be something that goes to the highest bidder.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery quote and comment is telling you this is bad,\u201d said Nanomax.\n\nA White House statement says the gold card is legal because the buyers are classified as candidates for the existing EB-1 or EB-2 pathway. The pathways are part of the \u201cEmployment-Based\u201d route, which allocates 140,000 green cards to migrants nominated by employers each year.\n\nRELATED: Vance \u2014 Securing America\u2019s Borders Is the \u2018Humanitarian Thing to Do for the Entire World\u2019\n\n\u201cA $1 million gift upon completion of the individual\u2019s vetting is evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States,\u201d says the gold card website.\n\nThe EB-1 pathway is for \u201cAliens with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics; Outstanding professors and researchers; or Certain multinational managers and executives.\u201d The EB-2 route is for migrants \u201cwho are members of the professions holding advanced degrees or who have exceptional ability.\u201d\n\nBoth routes are backlogged by Indian visa-workers who claim to be high-powered managers or gifted workers. For example, in August 2024, Breitbart News described one migrant who boasted that he had hired Indian contractors to embellish his claimed academic resume:\n\nThe way this works is that they interview you to learn the key things you\u2019ve done and record it, draft an article from your interview, ask you to do a final review and edits, and then work with various publications to get your article published. They\u2019re fairly expensive and charge $3500 for 1 article, $6700 for 2 and $9600 for 3. They\u2019re also quite slow \u2014 I decided to use them in mid-December and the articles came out in May and June, 6-7 months later.\n\nStill, the EB-1 and EB-2 pathways are far quicker than the EB-3 pathway.\n\nThe EB-3 pathway is allocated to ordinary visa workers, such as the vast majority of H-1B, H4EAD, L-1, and -1 visa workers now being imported to fill jobs that would otherwise go to young and mid-career Americans. Many of the ordinary visa workers willingly pay kickbacks to get starter jobs in the United States. This willingness to pay kickbacks ensures that many executives have a personal economic incentive to fire productive American professionals so their jobs can be sold to Indian migrants, often via a series of well-organized brokers and subcontractors.\n\nThe card plan faces additional pitfalls.\n\nThe Trump Gold Card is likely to trigger lawsuits by lawyers who are paid to guide migrants through the EB-1 and EB-2 pathways. It is also likely to be used by the many companies that are paid to help migrants by green cards via the EB-5 pathway, which offers 10,000 cards per year. The EB-5 cards are given to migrants who lend roughly $1 million to companies, typically to real estate investors.\n\nThe number of gold cards to be sold may be reduced by the existence of the rival paths, including the OPT-to-H-1B and EB-5 routes.\n\nAlso, there is a floating cap on the number of green cards that can be awarded to migrants from each nation per year. Those country caps keep any Indian applicants in line for roughly 10 years, regardless of the Trump Gold Card status.\n\n\u201cThe administration can\u2019t replace or bypass the normal immigration system,\u201d said a tweet from U.S. Tech Workers, which champions American professionals. Would-be migrants \u201cend up with two parallel tracks offering identical outcomes, except one charges a massive fee for no added benefit.\u201d",

In one of the more memorable campaign moments in modern history, the then-private citizen came down the golden escalator at Trump Tower to announce he was running for president, saying, \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe issue immediately became divisive, with opponents of cracking down on illegal immigrants claiming those who were for it were racist. As we saw, though, when Joe Biden came along with his \u201copen the floodgates\u201d policy, the Left actually has no interest in securing the border or stopping the flow of illegal drugs and aliens. In fact, they actively work against any efforts to do so.\n\nIn his '24 campaign, Trump continued to stress the importance of taking action, and that is one very big reason he was able to win a second non-consecutive term as the commander in chief.\n\nOn Wednesday, his administration focused once again on keeping the boundary secure, as the Interior Department announced new military zones on the border between Canada and Mexico:\n\nThe Department of Interior said it would transfer jurisdiction along most of California's border with Mexico to the Navy to reinforce \"the historic role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty.\" The Interior Department described the newest national defense area in California as a high-traffic zone for unlawful crossings by immigrants. But Border Patrol arrests along the southern U.S. border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since the 1960s amid President Trump's push for mass deportations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, CBS News, for pointing out that arrests by the Border Patrol have dropped to virtually zero. Why? Because of Trump\u2019s policies, like this new one. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, CBS.\n\nTake a look at what it was like under Joe Biden:\n\nAliens seeking asylum at the California US - Mexico border just south of San Ysidro port of entry.\n\n\n\nHomeland Security expects up to 13,000 crossings per day once Title 42 expires.\n\n\n\n- PoliceFrequency pic.twitter.com/ZuXXPacdi1 \u2014 suzy (@Suzy_1776) May 2, 2023\n\nThe move puts the military in charge of large swaths of what were formerly high-crossing areas:\n\nThe move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops to detain people who enter the country illegally and sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. It is done under the authority of the national emergency on the border declared by President Donald Trump on his first day in office.\n\nThe U.S. wants the zones operational to help combat the human smuggling networks and insidious drug cartels, both of which Trump has long emphasized. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a press release Wednesday that it is important to honor the \u201chistoric role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty\u201d:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy working with the Navy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use, and advancing the President's agenda.\n\nBy working with @USNavy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use and advancing @POTUS' agenda to put the safety and security of the American people FIRST! https://t.co/c2oYAdOeht \u2014 Secretary Doug Burgum (@SecretaryBurgum) December 10, 2025\n\nTrump promised over 10 years ago that he was going to fix the border \u2014 and he\u2019s been doing just that since he took up residence again in the White House in January. Promises made, promises kept.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: We voted for mass deportations, not mass amnesty. Help us continue to fight back against those trying to go against the will of the American people.\n\nJoin RedState's VIP today and use promo code FIGHT to get 60% off your VIP membership.",

      "full_content": "The Trump administration announced plans Wednesday to add another militarized zone to the southern border \u2014 this time in California \u2014 as part of a major shift that has thrust troops into border enforcement with Mexico like never before.\n\nThe Department of the Interior said it would transfer jurisdiction along most of California's border with Mexico to the Navy to reinforce \"the historic role public lands have played in safeguarding national sovereignty.\"\n\nThe Interior Department described the newest national defense area in California as a high-traffic zone for unlawful crossings by immigrants.\n\nThe move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops to detain people who enter the country illegally and sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement.\n\nIt is done under the authority of the national emergency on the border declared by President Donald Trump on his first day in office.\n\nThe military strategy was pioneered in April along a 170-mile stretch of the border in New Mexico and later expanded to portions of the border in Texas and Arizona.\n\nThe newly designated militarized zone extends nearly from the Arizona state line to the Otay Mountain Wilderness, traversing the Imperial Valley and border communities including the unincorporated community of Tecate, California, across the border from the Mexican city with the same name.\n\nMore than 7,000 troops have been deployed to the border, along with an assortment of helicopters, drones, and surveillance equipment.\n\nThe zones allow U.S. troops to apprehend immigrants and others who are accused of trespassing on Army, Air Force, or Navy bases.\n\nThose apprehended also could face additional criminal charges that can mean prison time.\n\nU.S. authorities say the zones are needed to close gaps in border enforcement and help in the wider fight against human smuggling networks and brutal drug cartels.\n\n\"By working with the Navy to close long-standing security gaps, we are strengthening national defense, protecting our public lands from unlawful use, and advancing the President's agenda,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a news release.\n\nThe new militarized zone was announced the same day a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to end the deployment of California National Guard troops in Los Angeles and return control of those troops to the state.\n\nThe state sued after Trump called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops in June without Gov. Gavin Newsom's approval to further the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts.",

      "full_content": "Instacart stated that its price \u201ctests\u201d are intended to help retailers \u201clearn what matters most to consumers.\u201d\n\nPrice Check is a new regular series tracking affordability in America.\n\n\n\nA new study has found that the food delivery service Instacart has been using an algorithm that charges different prices for different customers for the same items in the same stores without informing them. Surge pricing has been going on for years in ride share apps, but this new iteration sees different consumers paying different prices for food items based on the app's algorithm.\n\nResearch by Groundwork Collaborative examined pricing at Target and Safeway locations and highlighted several examples. At a Target store in North Canton, Ohio, Instacart charged a customer $2.99 for Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter on a day in September, while other users paid up to $3.59 for the same jar from the same location. At a Safeway in Seattle, Instacart users were charged five different prices for turkey, with the prices varying by 23 percent.\n\nThe study found that this has been happening at Target and Safeway stores in several cities after reviewing 437 shoppers who ordered groceries through the app for in-store pickup. The practice is known as \u201cdynamic pricing,\u201d a concept that has been controversial since Uber and Lyft began raising prices for rides when demand was high, such as during rainstorms. Airlines use a similar approach, raising ticket prices when many shoppers visit their sites at once, a system called \u201csurveillance pricing.\u201d\n\nGroundwork concluded that Instacart\u2019s pricing system could cause users to spend an extra $1,200 per year on groceries. The study found that nearly three-quarters of the items surveyed were sold at different prices on the app. In a statement to the New York Post, Instacart said its price \u201ctests\u201d are not based on characteristics of shoppers and that the prices are not \u201cdynamic\u201d because they do not change in real time.\n\nThe study found significant price differences by user but said it did not uncover evidence that the app was relying on personal information, though it noted that Instacart likely has the ability to factor in demographics such as age, household income, and whether a customer is new or returning. Instacart stated that its \u201ctests\u201d are intended to help retailers \u201clearn what matters most to consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2013 ones that already apply markups \u2013 do the same online via Instacart,\u201d a spokesperson told The New York Post.",

      "full_content": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon announced that the United States has seized an oil tanker bound for Cuba as it was sailing off the coast of Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela. Large tanker, very large. Largest one ever seized in action. And, other things are happening. So, you\u2019ll be seeing that later. And you\u2019ll be talking about that later with some other people,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nTrump said the tanker was seized \u201cfor a very good reason,\u201d but provided no further details. Asked what would happen to the ship\u2019s cargo of oil, he replied, \u201cWell, we keep it, I guess.\u201d\n\nA U.S. official said the seizure was \u201cled by the Coast Guard and supported by the U.S Navy.\u201d\n\nAnother official told the New York Times that the oil tanker is named \u201cSkipper\u201d and was \u201ccarrying a false flag of nationality\u201d at the time it was seized.\n\n\u201cIt was seized because of its past links to smuggling illicit Iranian oil, not because of ties to the Maduro regime, although it was carrying Venezuelan oil. A federal judge authorized a seizure warrant for the tanker roughly two weeks ago,\u201d the official said.\n\nUK-based maritime risk company Vanguard confirmed on Wednesday there is an oil tanker named Skipper that was sanctioned by the United States for allegedly being involved with the illegal trade of Iranian oil under another name, \u201cAdisa.\u201d\n\nAn unnamed source told Politico that \u201cthe ship was en route to Cuba, where the state firm Cubametales was planning to sell it to Asian energy brokers.\u201d Due to U.S. sanctions, most of Venezuela\u2019s oil product is sold to China.\n\nVenezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro did not directly address the tanker seizure in a belligerent speech he gave on Wednesday afternoon. He said during the speech that Venezuela\u2019s military is \u201cprepared to break the teeth of the North American empire, if necessary.\u201d\n\nInternational oil prices rose modestly on news of the seizure. Industry analysts said oil buyers would need time to learn the exact circumstances of the seizure, and if any Venezuelan oil was loaded aboard the ship, before calculating the impact on the availability of Venezuelan crude.",

      "full_content": "Wednesday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d Erika Kirk, the Turning Point USA CEO and widow of assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, addressed online conspiracies around her husband\u2019s murder.\n\nKirk said, \u201cIt reminds me so much of Chapter Six in the book of Nehemiah. He is building a wall, and the townspeople are at the base of that hill saying, \u2018Nehemiah,\u2019 calling him all these names, saying all these things, \u2018Come on down,\u2019 Every single time, he had the same message four times in a row: \u2018I cannot come down. I am busy building.\u2019 That is how I feel.\n\nShe continued, \u201cI do not have time to address the noise. My silence does not mean that I am complacent. My silence does not mean that somehow Turning Point USA and all of the handpicked staff that loved my husband and my husband loved them is somehow in on it. We are busy building. And you know what I thought? I thought these people are human. We are all grieving in our own way. And they are trying to find the answer to something that happened that was so evil. They are trying so hard. And I get that. We\u2019re doing the same. Anytime we hear a lead or anytime we hear anything, we send it to the authorities. Please dig into this. No rock will be unturned. I want justice for my husband, for myself, for my family more than anyone else out there.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cSo for me, you want to keep telling me to come down while we\u2019re building, I don\u2019t have time for that. But here\u2019s my breaking point on that. Come after me, call me names \u2014 I don\u2019t care. Call me what you want, go down that rabbit hole \u2014 whatever. But when you go after my family, my Turning Point USA family, my Charlie Kirk Show family, when you go after the people that I love, and you\u2019re making hundreds and thousands of dollars every single episode going after the people that I love because somehow they\u2019re in on this? No.\u201d\n\nHost Harris Faulkner said, \u201cYou know, I have to say it: I\u2019ve never seen you like this.\u201d\n\nKirk said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m very-, this is righteous anger because this is not okay, it\u2019s not healthy. This is a mind virus. Yes, I believe in our judicial system. I do. We have a hell of a team working on this, excuse my French. But this is not okay.\u201d\n\nFaulkner said, \u201cSo you want to put these people back in the box where they\u2019ve been creeping from?\u201d\n\nKirk said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what box you\u2019re in. But just know that your words are very powerful and we are human. My team are not machines and they\u2019re not robots. They are human. We have more death threats on our team and our side than I have ever seen. I have kidnapping threats. I have-, you name it, we have it. And my poor team is exhausted. And every time they bring this back up, what are we supposed to do? Relive that trauma all over again? They watched my husband get murdered. I have no idea how I would have reacted if I was there that day. And thank the good Lord that I did not have to see that happen. But my team, they are rocked to the core. So why every single day do they have to be dragged through the mud, analyzed, hyperanalyzed?\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAnd if people think that I was just gonna wilt away, I\u2019m not gonna sit in a corner, and cry, and be in fetal position. This is a duty to my husband and it\u2019s an absolute honor, and I will never back down. And so my message to them is to stop. To stop.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

During his brief tenure as head coach, the Wolverines went 16-8.\n\nOn3 reports that Michigan players were called in for an unscheduled team meeting where they were informed of Moore\u2019s firing. Michigan Athletic Director Warde Manuel then announced that Morre had been fired for cause after a university investigation found \u201ccredible evidence that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,\u201d according to his statement.\n\n\u201cSherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately,\u201d Manuel said in a statement. \u201cFollowing a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and UM maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\u201d\n\nBiff Poggi, who served as interim head coach during Moore\u2019s two-game suspension this year, will serve as interim head coach.\n\nManuel told team staff that the investigation into Moore had been ongoing since mid-November.\n\nThe Wolverines, currently ranked 18th, had an up-and-down season as they sought to break in new, young talent, specifically true freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood. A mid-season rally seemed ot put Michigan in a position to break into the 12-team bracket, but a 27-9 beatdown at the hands of archrival Ohio State put their playoff hopes to rest.\n\nMoore arrived at Michigan in 2018 as a tight ends coach and moved up to co-offensive coordinator in 2021. In 2023, he became the full-time offensive coordinator during a tumultuous year where a sign-stealing scandal rocked the program. Moore served as head coach for the Wolverines while Jim Harbaugh sat out a three-game suspension in connection with the scandal.\n\nThe Wolverines went 8-5 during Moore\u2019s first year at the helm\u2014a year highlighted by a thrilling victory over Ohio State in Columbus and a bowl victory over Alabama.\n\nMichigan went 9-3 in Moore\u2019s first full year as head coach. He served a two-game suspension in 2025 for his part in the sign-stealing scandal.\n\nThe Wolverines did not make the College Football Playoff in either of Moore\u2019s two seasons as head coach.",

Somehow, the sentence I'm about to write is even more dispiriting than the one that precedes it: Kyrgios and Sabalenka spent a half an hour on Tuesday promoting this match on Piers Morgan's show.\n\nThe newsworthy portion of the conversation arrived about halfway through, when Morgan turned to the topic of trans participation in sports. \"Martina Navratilova, a former No. 1 like yourself, says it's wrong for the Women's Tennis Association to allow trans women to compete in its events, do you agree with that?\" Morgan asked. Sabalenka replied:\n\nThat's a tricky question. I have nothing to do against [trans people], but I feel like they still got a huge advantage over the woman, and I think it's just not fair to the woman to basically face biologically a man. It's not fair, the woman been working her whole life to reach her limit, and then she has to face a man, which is biologically much stronger, so for me I don't agree with this kind of stuff in sport.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Kyrgios said that Sabalenka had \"hit the nail on the head.\"\n\nThis is all standard fare that you've heard from anti-trans activists hundreds of times by now, but this particular conversation was made more interesting by where it went next. Immediately after agreeing with Kyrgios and Sabalenka, Morgan brought up an incident from earlier this year when Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostyuk implied that Sabalenka has an advantage over her because of her size and potentially \"higher level of testosterone.\"\n\nHere was an interesting moment. Morgan, totally on accident (he asked this question in order to tee up a punchline built around putting Sabalenka's bikini pictures on screen), had plowed the conversation into a queasy and inconvenient truth that anti-trans agitators refuse to grapple with: In the absence of any actual high-level trans athletes attempting to compete, those who most prominently suffer when trans bans are put into place are cis athletes who do not conform to a particular image of femininity. In other words, if anyone currently on the tour is going to end up being subjected to gross speculation and invasive sex testing under a trans ban, it's players who look like Sabalenka.\n\nNone of this, nor the fact that they had just finished talking about how physical advantages can undermine the competitive fairness of their sport, seemed to enter into Sabalaneka's or Kyrgios's heads as they gave their response about Kostyuk:\n\nSabalenka: All I hear here is just excuses. And it's actually quite funny because she's a strong a girl, she probably has more muscles than I do. She looks fit and strong, and I think that's not the case in all of the matches she lost against top players. Kyrgios: We kind of debunked that. Someone like John Isner or Ivo Karlovi\u0107 was a fair bit bigger than Roger Federer, but that doesn't really\u2014 Morgan: Yeah, you're always going to get physical differences between players, obviously\u2014 Sabalenka: I think that's not the key in sports.\n\nThe most important ingredient in maintaining a commitment to anti-trans bigotry is never stopping to think about anything for more than two seconds.",

Was he abusing the mother of his own children? Did he kidnap his assistant so they could try to murder Kid Cudi? The doc doesn't prove any of it, but simply posing the questions in this format is suggestive. Listen to that music, he's evil!\n\nIt's not that the speculation is out of bounds or raised recklessly, but more that none of it is backed by anything beyond your own trust of people's stories. Some of the people telling their stories now, like Kirk Burrowes and Aubrey O'Day, have been public about the abuse they suffered for years, though they've gone largely ignored until recently. Other tales of Diddy's behavior have mostly proliferated as rumors and conjecture, and are now being presented more forthrightly since Diddy's fame no longer offers him the same protection as before. In fact, Diddy's history of narcissism, violence, and greed runs so deep that in four parts, the doc still misses several notable instances of it, including Lil Kim's prison stint, the mismanagement of Mase and The Lox, and the time he choked out a UCLA football coach.\n\nAs a documentary, The Reckoning is basically just a well-produced version of a TMZ or 20/20 news report. The one thing that makes it truly worthwhile is the personal footage Diddy himself shot during the height of his court cases. Presumably Diddy had it filmed because, ever the marketer, he planned to make his own documentary should the rulings go in his favor. How Stapleton was able to get her hands on it is an interesting, open question, as the footage is very revealing of Diddy's nature, from yelling at his attorneys to get control of the courtroom narrative, to planning out ways to discredit one of his accusers, to him walking around Harlem shaking hands with the people and then privately announcing that he needs a scalding hot shower to get all that \"people\" off of him. It's a shame that such a revealing look at a famous sociopath risks being overshadowed by the ultimately irrelevant casting of the doc as just another point 50 Cent has scored in his beef with Diddy.\n\nSean Combs: The Reckoning is worth your time if for no other reason than to see the pattern of behavior laid out in detail. It's not exactly rigorous journalism, but particularly in Part 4, the harrowing stories of the people who have had their lives destroyed by Diddy really hit home. Especially telling is the testimony of two of the jurors from his criminal trial, who clearly regarded Diddy with some kind of favor. One man felt that Diddy and Cassie's relationship was tumultuous in a typical way, and seemed to lack empathy for a woman living a life of luxury while also getting the shit beat out of her. The other juror, a young woman, seemed enthralled by Diddy as a mogul and the architect of the music of her youth, magnetized by his celebrity and therefore hesitant to accept any framing of him as some kind of supervillain.\n\nI feel confident that if the hotel video of Diddy kicking Cassie and grabbing her by the hair was never leaked, the general public wouldn't have had much trouble dismissing her claims of abuse for many of the same reasons that the two jurors gave. The story would've been that Cassie was just after money, and if her claims were real then why she didn't say anything sooner, and all the rest of the nonsense people come up with to avoid believing survivors. Even in our present reality, where the video did get out, some are still quick to block out the idea that domestic violence often speaks to a violent nature that manifests in other ways too. If you've seen Diddy beat up his girlfriend and believe her when she says he sexually abused and humiliated her, why is it a stretch to think that he could do the same or worse to multiple people? Particularly when he has had the money and power to get away with anything for about 30 years now.\n\nThese are the better questions to come out of this documentary, rather than gossiping about two middle-aged rappers and what their issues are with each other. Certainly a Netflix documentary can't give the answers, but at least we can start asking them. And while 50 Cent's involvement can allow Diddy supporters to scapegoat someone and obscure the darker truth, we shouldn't allow them to.",

According to The Athletic, cops in Pittsfield Charter Township, Mich., were summoned to the home of a \u201cfemale Michigan football staffer\u201d yesterday afternoon. The Pittsfield police issued a statement last night to ESPN and others, saying the officers were \u201cinvestigating an alleged assault\u201d at that address. Moore, who was not named in the statement, was subsequently arrested by police in the nearby town of Saline. The Athletic story says the arrest was part of the same assault investigation, and Moore was handed over to Pittsfield law enforcement.\n\nDefector\u2019s request to the Pittsfield Township Police Department for incident reports from Moore\u2019s arrest was denied. A Pittsfield police staffer told Defector earlier today that nothing beyond last night\u2019s statement will be issued. The officer declined to say if Moore is still in detention as of this morning, referring this reporter to Vinelink, a national online database of incarcerated individuals. A Vinelink search showed Moore remains in custody of the Washtenaw Corrections Division.\n\nThe rationale behind Moore\u2019s firing by the school is slightly more clear. A statement from Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel yesterday afternoon held that the school terminated his employment after an investigation of the coach found \u201ccredible evidence\u201d he\u2019d been in an apparently romantic relationship with a staff member.\n\n\u201cThis conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy,\u201d said Manuel, \u201cand U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior.\u201d\n\nMoore officially posted an 18-8 record in his two-plus seasons as head coach, which began when Jim Harbaugh left Michigan for the NFL amid a cheating scandal. Moore was given a three-game suspension last summer for his role in a robust sign-stealing scheme concocted by the Wolverines coaching staff that surfaced in 2023. He sat out two of those games this season and was due to finish the sentence in the first game of the 2026 season.\n\nMichigan is scheduled to face Texas in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl on New Year\u2019s Eve. Before Moore\u2019s arrest, the school announced that former Wolverines assistant Biff Poggi will be brought back as head coach for that game. The often-sleeveless Poggi played the same role during Moore's suspension.",

Just a day after the D\u00edaz news, fans learned that first baseman Pete Alonso would be signing with, of all teams, the penny-pinching Baltimore Orioles. The word from the insiders is that the Mets were ultimately fine with letting him walk if they otherwise would have had to spend $155 million over five years, but his absence means that a non-playoff team from last season is going to have to find a way to replace 38 home runs, 41 doubles, and a 144 OPS+ across 162 games.\n\nIn a world where baseball has a salary cap and owner Steve Cohen has a finite amount of money, the choice to let other teams snatch these players would be defensible baseball moves. Nimmo-for-Semien was a calculated swap of players with divergent strengths. If D\u00edaz pitches like he did in 2024, and Williams pitches like he did in 2023, nobody will mind the switch. And the haters are already wondering if Alonso's deal is an ill-advised sequel to the Orioles' dreaded Chris Davis contract. They would be wrong, because Chris Davis is still getting paid, but it was clear in Alonso's free agency last winter and this winter that most of the league is very down on the thought that the slugger's skills will hold up in his 30s.\n\nIn this world, however, baseball doesn't have a salary cap, and Cohen is about to build a heavily lobbied-for casino next to his ballpark, so it feels fair for fans to ask him this question: Hey, instead of making us say goodbye to our favorite players, why not just pay them with some of that future slot-machine cash? I can't help but feel a little stupidly naive, being taken aback by roster movement in 2025, but as someone who fell in love with this specific era of the local baseball team, I do have to admit that I feel sad about how much the Mets will look like some other squad next year. Nimmo, despite that awful Christian rock walk-up song, was one of the Mets' most consistent hitters for 10 seasons. D\u00edaz's trumpets feel like the thing young Mets fans will best remember about their first trips to games decades from now. And I can't count how many times Alonso lifted me out of my seat by walloping a ball over the fence; I've definitely seen him hit more home runs live than any other player in my lifetime.\n\nThe way the Mets ended last season was excruciating, as the team played .400 ball over the final two months of the season to waste away an inspiring start. It makes sense if the mission is not to repeat what happened last summer, and as these players leave, there remain other talented options available for the wooing. Whatever happens, these transactions have ensured that there's no turning back\u2014that all the fans understand the 2026 season will be different than the one that came before. If it doesn't work, everyone will know exactly who to blame.",

Hummel, a Purdue University legend who briefly played in the NBA before turning to broadcasting, reported from the Suns bench that coach Jordan Ott had spent the previous huddle telling Mark Williams to continue to \"win the race\" against his man every time. Hummel delivered his report while wedged next to the actor Austin Butler, whom play-by-play man Noah Eagle razzed Hummel for not knowing about before checking in with Derek Fisher from the Lakers bench.\n\nReporters on the bench, \"Roundball Rock,\" and the sonorous stylings of play-by-play guy Michael Grady are all new to the NBA's national broadcasts this season, the first campaign under the league's new TV contract. The 11-year deal represents the biggest change to national NBA broadcasts since 2002, when ESPN replaced NBC. For 22 seasons, national games were carried by ESPN and TNT, or, to put it in corporate conglomerate terms, networks under the Disney and Time Warner umbrellas.\n\nUnder the new deal, NBC is back, ESPN and partner network ABC are still around, and Amazon is making its NBA broadcasting debut. The latter, the fifth-most valuable company in the world, succeeded in entering into the business only after TNT's parent company, now known as Warner Bros. Discovery (after four name changes in the intervening period), filed suit against the NBA and reached a settlement. WBD's desperation to claw its way back into the deal, which is three times bigger than its predecessor and runs for two years longer, indicates that despite eternal crowing about ratings and worries about cord-cutting, live sports are still incredibly important to any company in the broadcasting business. Every major media company is trying to buy up more live sports rights.\n\nTo the basketball fan, the pressing matter in this season of change isn't corporate intrigue, but rather the aesthetic experience on offer from the new broadcasters. How do the games feel on Amazon and Peacock, and what are these networks doing differently? What is happening over at ESPN, which ended the last TV deal with a whimper? In other words, what is the state of the NBA on TV?\n\nI began this story with a clip from Peacock because NBC has the most games this year, and because NBC's broadcasts are breaking the most new ground. They are also retracing a lot of old ground. The network's broadcasts are chiefly associated with the NBA's Michael Jordan-era glory days, which the network often seeks to remind the viewer. That has taken the form of MJ: Insights to Excellence, interviews\u2014rather, an interview, singular, stretched across multiple broadcasts\u2014with Jordan himself, conducted by Mike Tirico, in which the Hall of Famer and Charlotte Hornets minority owner offers his perspectives on the love of the game (it's important), what he owes to the future of the sport (\"to be able to pass on messages of success and dedication\"), and load management (not a fan). Jordan isn't a particularly magnetic interview subject, and it's quite funny that NBC is stretching out one interview (they say they'll do more) to this extent, but his involvement does feel pretty cool.\n\nAs for the new ground, the clip from the Suns\u2013Lakers game that opened this story shows what Peacock is cooking and why it's cool. The broadcast was technically a three-man booth, though only Noah Eagle was sitting in the traditional spot along center court doing familiar play-by-play commentary. Fisher, in his first season as a broadcaster and coming along, and Hummel, in his eighth and really good at this, filled out the booth with reports from each team's bench as well as running color commentary. The dynamic totally works. The bench reporters offer the sort of unique insights you can only get from inside a huddle, and they also play a critical role in making the game feel more alive to the viewer.\n\nThere is a substantive difference between a color commentator telling you about a conversation they had with an assistant coach before the game and someone talking to you while sitting courtside, often right next to their subjects. Lakers games feel different in part because people as famous as Austin Butler are sitting courtside at them and not in, say, Charlotte. Conveying that on a broadcast\u2014in this case, from a seat beside the celebrity\u2014shows you something unique.\n\nNBC shows player introductions from within the arena, usually while the players introduce themselves directly to the camera. That stuff is cool, as are Jamal Crawford on the call; Maria Taylor and a trio of Real Hoopers on the pregame and halftime desk; and NBC's 1080p HDR picture quality, the result of a six-year transition over from SDR. Less cool are the baked-in gambling graphics on Peacock and the 11 p.m. Eastern start times for certain West Coast games. As a West Coaster myself, I actually like being able to watch basketball well past 10 p.m., though I understand that being asked to stay up past 1 a.m. is a totally different prospect, one that will undoubtedly prevent non-freaks from catching many second halves. Your mileage will undoubtedly vary on Reggie Miller.\n\nThe biggest innovation Amazon has made, in turn, is its outrageously spacious studio. It's 13,000 square feet, two stories high, and it features a full-LRED regulation-size halfcourt where analysts can draw up plays and explain the sinews of the game. Former TNT host Taylor Rooks leads a desk composed of several former players, an ensemble which isn't yet all that magnetic but is starting to hit its stride in the coverage I've watched. They aren't going for an Inside the NBA\u2013style comedy troupe thing, which is to their credit, because what Blake Griffin, Udonis Haslem, Steve Nash, and Dirk Nowitzki are collectively good at is explaining basketball. It's refreshing to see a studio show that can not only tell you about pindown actions but also, on the halfcourt, show how they work.\n\nAs befits the size of the studio and five-person desk, Amazon also has a huge group of contributors, including the great Zach Lowe and Tyrese Haliburton, moonlighting while he recovers from a torn Achilles tendon. The chemistry of the main desk hosts is still coming along, though hopefully that will improve the longer they work together.\n\nOn the court, Prime Video games feel like spruced-up TNT broadcasts. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and although Kevin Harlan has lost a step as a play-by-play commentator, he still has the best voice in the business. An interesting thing Prime Video does is rotate its play-by-play announcers and color commentators, opting for variety over the traditional system of fixed pairings. Dwyane Wade's work in the booth is super impressive, as viewers of Olympic basketball would have noticed last summer, and it's great to have Brent Barry back in broadcasting after years in various league front offices and coaching staffs.\n\nPrime Video's big showcase is currently underway, as it holds broadcast rights for the NBA Cup. Eric Collins and Dell Curry, who work together on local Charlotte Hornets broadcasts, called Tuesday's Miami Heat\u2013Orlando Magic game. While I am not personally a fan of Collins's histrionics or his tendency to mispronounce names\u2014e.g.: calling Goga Bitadze \"Gogo\"\u2014he certainly does bring a level of energy to the games that nobody else can match. But neither he nor Harlan are my favorite broadcaster working right now. That would be Michael Grady.\n\nA friend who is a diehard Minnesota Timberwolves fan put me on to Grady last spring, insisting we watch the Wolves' first-round playoff games on the local broadcast instead of the national because he needed to hear Grady on the call. After some initial grousing (I wanted to listen to Mark Jones), I ended up grateful for it. Grady makes every game better. After spending some time working the sideline for the Brooklyn Nets, Grady joined the Minnesota broadcast booth just three years ago; under the new deal, he is the only person who calls games for both NBC and Prime, a sign of how quickly his star has risen.\n\nThe first thing that pops is Grady's smooth baritone. The second is that he never over-talks, instead letting the game attest to itself in the right moments and seeking to supplement the viewer's eyes rather than replace them. The third is his signature call: \"CASH!\" Grady is a good contrast with Collins, whom people like for his histrionic style. If Collins makes the game better it is through exaggeration, which is not necessarily a bad thing: You want performers to perform, though this style's effectiveness is in how it adds to the game experience. Grady, on the other hand, does not add so much as enhance. The shape of the basketball game remains the same in his hands, only polished to its finest sheen. To me, Grady is the best announcer working in the business.\n\nAmazon has had a lot of help along the way from ESPN. Prime Video has two huge game trucks (\"Magic\" for the West Coast, \"Bird\" for the East) that assist in its broadcasts, and ESPN often shares them with Amazon. Per Sports Video Group, \"ESPN has weekly meetings with NBA technical, the NBA, and Amazon to share notes, work through venue and team idiosyncrasies, and decipher plans for sharing mobile units and/or generators.\"\n\nESPN has caught a lot of shit, including from us, for its NBA broadcast work over the past few years. The network shook up its lead broadcast booth this year, replacing Doris Burke with Tim Legler, who knows ball and is generally good at communicating it. The problem with that booth was third man Richard Jefferson, who's still there, and who remains a rough watch and listen. Aside from him, though, ESPN still knows how to broadcast a game. Mercifully, atrocious analyst Bob Myers has left the company, and the crew of veterans still around (Ryan Ruocco, Dave Pasch) are solid and mostly worth listening to. Sadly, Jones is slipping out of this category.\n\nThere's a strain of discourse that contrasts Steve Nash drawing up\u2014and acting out!\u2014pick-and-roll coverages on Prime Video against Stephen A. Smith hawking an allegedly rigged Israeli solitaire casino game on ESPN, and concludes that ESPN does not care about basketball, unlike these other guys. Not to defend the Worldwide Leader's honor, but I think that diagnosis is overcooked. ESPN's Finals coverage was disastrous, but also very different in feel from its bread-and-butter NBA broadcasts. There's a lot of good stuff in there still, and Legler is one of the best at triangulating the ex-player experience with the trajectory of the modern game. It is striking, however, how barren ESPN's roster is. With Grady excelling at NBC and Amazon, ESPN no longer has the premier booth in the game, nor does it have an obvious rising star. Instead it has Richard Jefferson. That's the bigger problem, not the malignant omnipresence of Smith.\n\nFor the fan, the hope here is that the three broadcast partners can push each other, borrowing the best stuff along the way. As much as I like hearing \"Roundball Rock,\" the best part of what has been a great national broadcast experience so far is its variety. To be clear, I mean \"great national broadcast situation\" only in a strict televisual sense, as dealing with three separate streaming apparatuses is a huge pain in the ass, tracking which of them has the games on a given night is annoying, and having to learn their respective quirks\u2014e.g.: Amazon's volume button does not mute when you click it; ESPN's iPhone app will pop up the settings page asking you to turn alerts on literally every time you open it\u2014is tedious. But the basketball experience has been great. And we made it through this story without once talking about ratings!",

      "full_content": "Their team lost.\n\nEight teen football players from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were arrested on theft charges in Florida after being caught in a brazen \"conspiracy\" to steal thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise from a Dick's Sporting Goods. The juvenile suspects had traveled to Polk County, Florida, to participate in the Prolifix Nationals tournament at the time of their apprehensions.\n\n\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) said in a press release that the incident occurred just hours before the teens were scheduled to participate in the championship game. They were handcuffed instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 10:55 am on December 6, a store manager at the Dick's Sporting Goods in Davenport contacted the sheriff's office \"after observing multiple juveniles concealing merchandise.\" PCSO deputies arrived on scene and detained all eight football players.According to authorities, the suspects split into two groups to carry out the conspiracy. Marcus Hudgens, 15, made a purchase near the front of the store and then approached his teammates, who were walking around inside. Hudgens opened his Dick's Sporting Goods bag, and the other suspects placed merchandise inside it.Daimon Johnson, 15, Mark Bryan, 15, and Ibn Mahdee Abdul Haqq, 14, then exited the store with the bag full of stolen merchandise. They were arrested upon exit. Abdul-Haqq allegedly had stolen merchandise concealed inside a black backpack, while Bryan was in possession of the bag from the store that consisted of more than $2,000 worth of stolen goods. The other five suspects were detained inside the store. This included Hudgens, Elijah Myers, 14, Tymir Speller, 15, Tymir Smith, 14, and Jacob Scott, 15. Authorities discovered a beanie hidden inside Speller's pants when he was detained, according to the press release.Photo Polk County Sheriff's OfficeThe eight teens were identified as members of the United Thoroughbreds, a youth football team located in Philadelphia. The total value of stolen merchandise totaled $2,296.07.\"These juveniles were not from Polk County, they came here from Philly for a football tournament, and instead of representing their team with pride, they chose to steal - they are Thoroughbred thieves,\" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who shamed the players in a press conference. \"Let this be clear: it doesn't matter if you're from here or visiting, if you break the law in Polk County, you will be arrested and held accountable.\"The team's coach, Raekwon Bynes, 29, responded to the store and confirmed to authorities that the teens were staying in Davenport for the championship game, the sheriff's office said. The eight suspects had no prior criminal histories and declined to provide statements to authorities. The players were transported to the Juvenile Assessment Center, and each was charged with retail theft and conspiracy to commit retail theft.Sheriff Judd congratulated the opposing team for defeating the Thoroughbreds in the championship game, stating that the Coco Tigers didn't just win but \"ran over them.\" The Thoroughbreds lost the game 26-6.",

      "content": "<div class=\"FeatureByline\">\n           By <b>Jonathan Corbet</b><br>December 11, 2025</br>\n           <hr>\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1049982/\">Maintainers Summit</a>\n</div>\nThe first topic of discussion at the 2025 Maintainers Summit has been in\nthe air for a while: what role \u2014 if any \u2014 should machine-learning-based\ntools have in the kernel development process?  While there has been a fair\namount of controversy around these tools, and concerns remain, it seems\nthat the kernel community, or at least its high-level maintainership, is\ncomfortable with these tools becoming a significant part of the development\nprocess.\n<p>\nSasha Levin began the discussion by pointing to <a\nhref=\"https://lwn.net/ml/all/aTYmE53i3FJ_lJH2@laps\">a summary</a> he had sent to the\nmailing lists a few days before.  There is some consensus, he said, that\nhuman accountability for patches is critical, and that use of a large\nlanguage model in the creation of a patch does not change that.  Purely\nmachine-generated patches, without human involvement, are not welcome.\nMaintainers must retain the authority to accept or reject machine-generated\ncontributions as they see fit.  And, he said, there is agreement that the\nuse of tools should be disclosed in some manner.\n<p>\n<!-- middle-ad -->\n<h4>Just tools?</h4>\n<p>\nBut, he asked the group: is there agreement in general that these tools\nare, in the end, just more tools?  Steve Rostedt said that LLM-generated\ncode may bring legal concerns that other tools do not raise, but Greg\nKroah-Hartman answered that the current developers certificate of origin\n(\"Signed-off-by\") process should cover the legal side of things.  Rostedt\nagreed that the submitter is ultimately on the hook for the code they\ncontribute, but he wondered about the possibility of some court ruling that\na given model violates copyright years after the kernel had accepted code\nit generated.  That would create the need for a significant cleanup effort.\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1049977/\"><img\nsrc=\"https://lwn.net/images/conf/2025/ossjp/SashaLevin-sm.png\" alt=\"[Sasha Levin]\"\ntitle=\"Sasha Levin\" class=\"rthumb\"></a>\n\nTed Ts'o said that people worry about the copyright problems, but those\nsame problems exist even in the absence of these tools.  Developers could,\nfor example, submit patches without going through the processes required by\ntheir employer \u2014 patches which, as a result, they have no right to submit.\nWe do not worry about that problem now, he said, and it has almost never\nactually come up.  Jiri Kosina said that these tools make code creation\neasy enough that the problem could become larger over time.\nDave Airlie asked whether it makes sense to keep track of which models\npeople are using.  But, he said, any copyrighted code put into a patch by\nan LLM is likely to have come from the kernel itself.\n<p>\nLevin mentioned that there had been some ethical concerns raised about LLM\nuse and its effects on the rest of the world.  Arnd Bergmann said that it\ncould make sense to distinguish between which types of models are in use.\nRunning one's own model locally is different from using a third party's\ntool.  \n<p>\nLinus Torvalds jumped in to say that he thought the conversation was overly\nfocused on the use of LLMs to write code, but there has not, yet, been much\nof that happening for the kernel.  So any problems around LLM-written code\nare purely hypothetical.  But these tools <i>are</i> being used for other\npurposes, including identifying CVE candidates and stable-backport\ncandidates, and for <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1041694/\">patch review</a>.  Andrew\nMorton, Torvalds said, had recently shown an example of a machine-reviewed\npatch that was \"<q>stunning</q>\"; it found all of the complaints that\nTorvalds had raised with the patch in question, and a few more as well.\n<p>\nAlexei Starovoitov said that, within Meta, automated tools have been\nproducing good reviews about 60% of the time, with another 20% having some\ngood points.  Less than 20% of the review comments have been false\npositives.  Jens Axboe added that he has been testing with older patches\nand seeing similar results.  He passed one five-line patch with a known\nproblem to three human reviewers, and none of them found the bug.  But the\nautomated tool did find the problem (a reversed condition in a test);\n\"<q>AI always catches that stuff</q>\".\n<p>\nChristian Brauner asked the group how many people use LLMs for coding;\nabout four developers raised their hands.  Shuah Khan expressed concern\nabout access to LLMs; most of this work is being done behind corporate\nwalls.  Ts'o said that he has been using the review prompts posted Chris\nMason, originally written for Claude, with Gemini, with generally good\nresults and at a relatively low cost.\n<p>\nTorvalds, though, pointed out that developers have long been complaining\nabout a lack of code review; LLMs may just solve that problem.  They are\nnot writing code at this point, he said, though that will likely happen\nat some point too.  Once these systems start submitting kernel code, we\nwill truly need automated systems to review all that code, he said.\n<p>\n<h4>Proprietary systems</h4>\n<p>\nKonstantin Ryabitsev said that he had tried using some of these systems,\nbut found them to be far too expensive; he also was worried about depending\non proprietary technology.  Brauner said that this usage had to be\nsupported by employers, or perhaps the Linux Foundation could attempt to\nprovide an automated review service.  Ts'o said that the expense depends on\nhow the system is used.  One can pull in the entire kernel, using a lot of\ntokens; that will be expensive.  The alternative is to create a set of\nreview rules, reducing the token use by a factor of at least five.  Khan\nrepeated that not all developers will have equal access to this technology.\n<p>\nMark Brown was concerned about requiring submitters to run their patches\nthrough proprietary tools; some will surely object to that.  Axboe\nsuggested that the review tools should be run by subsystem maintainers, not\nsubmitters.\n<p>\nI pointed out that, 20 years ago, the kernel community abruptly lost access\nto BitKeeper, highlighting the hazards of depending on proprietary tools.\nIf the kernel community becomes dependent on these systems, development\nwill suffer when the inevitable rug-pull happens.  At some point, the cost\nof using LLMs will have to increase significantly if the companies behind\nthem are to have a chance at reaching their revenue targets.\n<p>\nTorvalds, though, called that concern a \"<q>non-argument</q>\".  We do not\nhave those tools today, he said; if they go away tomorrow, the community\nwill just be back where it is now.  Meanwhile, he said, we should take\nadvantage of the technology industry's willingness to waste billions of\ndollars to get people to use these tools.  Even if it only lasts a couple\nof years, it can help the community.\n<p>\nStarovoitov said that he loves the reviews that the BPF community gets from\nthe LLM systems.  They ask good questions even when the reviews are wrong.\nEven better, developers respond to the questions, despite the fact that\nthey are answering a bot; those answers can be used to help the models\nlearn to do better in the future.  But he acknowledged a recent three-day\noutage caused by some problems at GitHub; it \"<q>felt devastating</q>\".  He\nwas just waiting for the service to come back, since it does a better job\nof reviewing than he does.\n<p>\n<h4>Disclosure</h4>\n<p>\nLevin shifted the discussion to disclosure requirements.  There have been\nproposals for an Assisted-by tag that would name the specific tool used;\nshould that tag be required for all tools, or just for LLMs?  Torvalds said\nthat he would like to see links to LLM-generated reviews, but that there is\nno need for a special review tag.  Ts'o agreed, saying that people need to\nlook at the reviews to determine whether they make sense, but he pointed\nout that a lot of reviews are not posted publicly.  Starovoitov answered\nthat the reviews in the BPF subsystem are posted as email responses to the\npatches.\n<p>\nKees Cook said that he didn't care about which specific tag is used, he\njust wants to know what he should use; Torvalds answered that there does\nnot need to be a tag at all.  The information could just be put into the\nchangelog instead.  Ryabitsev suggested putting it after the \"<tt>---</tt>\"\nmarker so that it doesn't appear in the Git changelog, but Bergmann said he\nwould prefer to have that information in the changelog.  Torvalds accused\nthe group of over-thinking the problem, saying that it was better to\nexperiment and see what works.  The community should encourage disclosure\nof tool use, but not make hard rules about how that disclosure should be\ndone.\n<p>\nTs'o said that, in any case, it is not possible to count on submitters\ndisclosing their tool use; some people may want to lie about it.  Dan\nWilliams said that disclosure rules would make it clear that the community\nvalues transparency in this area.  Levin added that the nice thing about\nthese tools is that they listen; if a disclosure rule is added to the\ndocumentation, the models will comply.  Williams suggested a rule that all\nchangelogs should mention leprechauns.\n<p>\nAs the session moved toward a close, Levin said he would post a\ndocumentation patch asking LLM tools to add an Assisted-by tag, but would\nnot make an effort to enforce the rule.  There was some final discussion on\nthe details of that tag, which seems sure to evolve over time.",

She recently snatched Matt Gutman from ABC News, and promoted King\u2019s colleague Tony Dokoupil to anchor of \u201cCBS Evening News.\u201d\n\n6 The New York Post exclusively reported Tony Dokoupil was being promoted to anchor of \u201cCBS Evening News.\u201d CBS via Getty Images\n\n6 CBS boss Bari Weiss recently hired Matt Gutman from ABC News.
