During a rally Tuesday evening in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, President Trump reminded both Republicans and Democrats of just how savvy a messenger he can be when energizing his base. He crushed former President Joe Biden and his administration for overseeing the runaway inflation we are still battling today. He discussed his efforts to bring higher wage jobs to American workers, not illegal aliens. He dismantled Obamacare, highlighting high costs and the trillions in taxpayer dollars given to insurance companies instead of the American people. President Trump went full MAGA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe energy in the room was electric. The subliminal message was clear: Republicans, take this message and run with it during the 2026 midterm election cycle. President Trump tore apart Obamacare. He is tired of insurance companies lining their pockets with Obamacare subsidies, and stated once again that he wants that money sent directly to the American people.\n\n.@POTUS: \"Under Obamacare, trillions of dollars were given directly to health insurance companies...I want to give billions of dollars directly to the people...I want to give NOTHING to the insurance companies...We want you to go out and buy your own health insurance.\" pic.twitter.com/Yrr3dmZOmF \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump Touts the Economy and Tackles 'Affordability' in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump Shares Incredible Update About National Guardsman Shot in DC Terror Attack\n\nImagine being able to use your own money to purchase health insurance instead of those dollars going straight to the insurance companies? For Republicans in 2026, this is a smart policy that could excite the base in an election cycle where President Trump is not on the ballot. Healthcare across America, in many cases, is unaffordable and frustrating. This is certainly an area where the GOP can make up ground with sound policy ideas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump has essentially closed our southern border by the sheer power he wields through the executive branch. The administration has now moved to tackle illegal immigration within our borders, in regards to both deportations and American jobs taken by illegal aliens.\n\n.@POTUS: Before I took office, 100% of all net new jobs were going to migrants and illegals. Since I took office, 100% of ALL net job creation is going to AMERICAN CITIZENS \u2014 and now, more Americans are working than any time in the history of our country. pic.twitter.com/7zBoCrPCAE \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nWow. Since President Trump took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American citizens. That is an amazing statistic that every GOP House and Senate member should be touting on the campaign trail. Not for nothing, but President Trump is also clearly tired of immigrants coming to America who do not care to fully assimilate or share our values.\n\n.@POTUS: \"If you don't share our values, contribute to our economy, and assimilate into our society, then we don\u2019t want you in our country \u2014 we don't want you.\" pic.twitter.com/NqBWr1ceZ3 \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump also announced a permanent pause on third-world migration, \"including from hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia, and many other countries.\" This is a very smart and, frankly, important policy. During the recent off-year election cycle, many Americans learned for the first time how many third-world immigrants have infiltrated major American cities. This is a winning message and one the GOP should carry into 2026.\n\nFinally, the deadly drugs have got to stop flowing into this country. President Trump has taken lethal action that is sure to have every drug boat planning to bring drugs to America second-guessing that decision. For some Republicans who support Trump's policy but have struggled to properly communicate the importance to their constituents, the president simplified the issue for the entire party.\n\n\ud83d\udea8POTUS on Venezuelan Drug Boats: \"Think about it\u2014every boat that gets hit, we save 25,000 American lives.\" pic.twitter.com/Kd9mMQBXgJ \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) December 10, 2025\n\nThis is where President Trump is at his best. Instead of litigating the action he has taken on the Venezuelan drug boats, he simply points to the number of American lives his actions are saving. 25,000 American lives is not a small number. For the GOP in 2026, the message from President Trump in Pennsylvania is crystal clear: \"After just 10 months, our border is secure, our spirit is restored, inflation is stopped, wages are up, prices are down...and America is back!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow his lead.\n\nEditor's Note: Help RedState continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration's accomplishments as we continue to usher in the Golden Era of America.

      "full_content": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2013 Ukrainian officials were expected to hand their latest peace proposals to United States negotiators Wednesday, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who also said Ukraine would be ready for elections within three months if partners can guarantee a safe vote during wartime and if its electoral law can be altered.\n\nZelenskyy was responding to comments by U.S. President Donald Trump in which he questioned Ukraine\u00b4s democracy and suggested the Ukrainian leader was using the war as an excuse not to hold an election.\n\nZelenskyy told reporters late Tuesday that he is \u201cready\u201d for an election but would need help from the U.S. and possibly Europe to ensure security for a vote to happen. He suggested that Ukraine could be ready to hold balloting in 60 to 90 days if that proviso is met.\n\n\u201cTo hold elections, two issues must be addressed: primarily, security \u2013 how to conduct them, how to do it under strikes, under missile attacks; and a question regarding our military \u2013 how they would vote,\u201d Zelenskyy said.\n\n\u201cAnd the second issue is the legislative framework required to ensure the legitimacy of elections,\u201d he said.\n\nPreviously, Zelenskyy had pointed out that a ballot can\u2019t legally take place while martial law imposed due to Russia\u2019s invasion nearly four years ago is in place. He has also asked how a vote could happen when civilian areas of Ukraine are being bombarded by Russia and almost 20% of the country is under Russian occupation.\n\nZelenskyy said he has asked lawmakers from his party in Parliament to draw up legislative proposals that would allow elections while Ukraine is under martial law.\n\nUkrainians have on the whole supported Zelenskyy\u2019s arguments, and there has been no clamor in Ukraine for an election. Under the Ukrainian law that is in force, Zelenskyy\u00b4s rule is legitimate.\n\nBut with Trump pressing hard for a deal between Kyiv and Moscow, Zelenskyy is walking a tightrope between defending Ukrainian interests and showing the American president that he is willing to make some compromises.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly complained that Zelenskyy can\u2019t legitimately negotiate a peace settlement because his five-year term in office that began in 2019 has expired.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an important time to hold an election. They\u2019re using war not to hold an election,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Politico, echoing Moscow\u2019s stance.\n\nA new U.S. national security strategy released last Friday made it clear that Trump wants to improve America\u00b4s relationship with Moscow and \u201creestablish strategic stability with Russia.\u201d\n\nThe document also portrays European allies as weak.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday praised Trump\u2019s role in the Ukraine peace effort, saying in a speech at the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia\u2019s Parliament, that Moscow appreciates his \u201ccommitment to dialogue.\u201d Trump, Lavrov said, is \u201cthe only Western leader\u201d who shows \u201can understanding of the reasons that made war in Ukraine inevitable.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s decisions are likely to be pivotal for Ukraine, Washington\u2019s peace efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nTrump\u2019s initial peace proposal was heavily slanted toward Russia\u2019s demands. To counter that, Zelenskyy has turned to his European supporters.\n\nIn recent days, Zelenskyy met the leaders of Britain, Germany and France in London, and the heads of NATO and the European Union in Brussels, before traveling on to Rome for talks with the Italian prime minister and Pope Leo XIV.\n\nZelenskyy said three documents were being discussed with American and European partners \u2013 a 20-point framework document that is constantly changing, a document on security guarantees, and a document about Ukraine\u2019s recovery.\n\nEurope\u2019s support is uneven, however, and that has meant a drop-off in military aid since the Trump administration this year cut off supplies to Kyiv unless they were paid for by other NATO countries.\n\nForeign military help for Ukraine fell sharply over the summer, and that trend continued through September and October, a German body that tracks international help for Ukraine said Wednesday.\n\nAverage annual aid, mostly provided by the U.S. and Europe, was around 41.6 euros billion ($48.4 billion) between 2022-2024. But so far this year Ukraine has received just 32.5 billion euros ($37.8 billion), the Kiel Institute said.\n\n\u201cIf this slower pace continues in the remaining months (of the year), 2025 will become the year with the lowest level of new aid allocations\u201d since the war began, it said.\n\nThis year, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have substantially increased their help for Ukraine, while Germany nearly tripled its average monthly allocations and France and the U.K. both more than doubled their contributions, according to the Kiel Institute.\n\nOn the other hand, it said, Spain recorded no new military aid for Kyiv in 2025 while Italy reduced its low contributions by 15% compared with 2022-2024.",

Ticktin made the claim in a Saturday letter addressed to President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump</a>, who has expressed keen interest in the case.</p><p>\"About 6 months ago, Mrs. Peters was threatened with harm. Her life was threatened by a group of inmates, to stab her and to kill her. This was reported to the FBI and DOJ, which had agents interview her. She was moved to a different unit,\" Ticktin wrote.</p><p>\"In the new unit, she was attacked by other prisoners three times in different locations where guards had to pull inmates off of her,\" the letter continued. \"There is actually a safe unit where inmates who do not cause problems can be assigned.

Peters filed a lawsuit seeking her release earlier this year, arguing that her <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/first-amendment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free speech rights</a> had been violated, but Judge Scott Varholak rejected the move on Monday.</p><p>Peters is the only <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump ally</a> to face prison time for 2020 election denial, and she has received significant support from the president.</p><p>\"Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment.

Her attorney, Peter Ticktin, says she has been violently attacked by fellow inmates on three separate occasions. Ticktin made the claim in a Saturday letter addressed to President <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donald Trump</a>, who has expressed keen interest in the case.</p><p>\"About 6 months ago, Mrs. Peters was threatened with harm. Her life was threatened by a group of inmates, to stab her and to kill her. This was reported to the FBI and DOJ, which had agents interview her. She was moved to a different unit,\" Ticktin wrote.</p><p>\"In the new unit, she was attacked by other prisoners three times in different locations where guards had to pull inmates off of her,\" the letter continued. \"There is actually a safe unit where inmates who do not cause problems can be assigned. She has applied to be put into that unit but was denied six times without a valid reason.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-issues-sweeping-pardons-2020-election-allies-what-move-really-means\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP ISSUES SWEEPING PARDONS FOR 2020 ELECTION ALLIES \u2014 WHAT THE MOVE REALLY MEANS</strong></a></p><p>Ticktin went on to argue that Trump has the power to pardon Peters despite her being convicted of state-level crimes.</p><p>\"The reason that many pundits opine that you have only the power to grant pardons for federal offenses is that we all understand the 'United States' to be the federal government of our country,\" he wrote, referring to the text of the pardon power in the Constitution.</p><p>\"We have one country, and it is called the 'United States,'\" he added before making a lengthy argument about the phrasing of the pardon power.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-issues-fresh-pardons-jan-6-defendants-including-woman-accused-threatening-fbi-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TRUMP ISSUES FRESH PARDONS FOR JAN 6 DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING WOMAN ACCUSED OF THREATENING FBI ON SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></a></p><p>Peters was sentenced to nine years in prison after a state jury convicted her of participating in a scheme to breach the Mesa County voting systems following the 2020 elections. Peters filed a lawsuit seeking her release earlier this year, arguing that her <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/first-amendment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free speech rights</a> had been violated, but Judge Scott Varholak rejected the move on Monday.</p><p>Peters is the only <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trump ally</a> to face prison time for 2020 election denial, and she has received significant support from the president.</p><p>\"Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment.

He is blaming the economy on that President. Does the former administration deserve at least some of the criticism?\u201d\n\nBeshear answered, \u201cWell, the former administration was attempting to build the economy of tomorrow, investing in really important industries like EVs and chips in areas for our national security that we\u2019ve got to catch up with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nCoates then cut in to say, \u201cWere they successful at that, Governor?\u201d\n\nBeshear responded, \u201c[O]ur families were saying we need the economy of right now. Now, wages were catching up to inflation. And this president, President Trump, was going to inherit a good, healthy economy.

This is all about transparency and showing results,\u201d DHS\u2019s Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement:\n\nAs the media whitewashes the facts, day in and day out, our brave men and women of ICE risk their lives for the American people. Americans don\u2019t have to rely on the press for this information \u2013 with this transparent tool, they can see for themselves what public safety threats were lurking in their neighborhoods and communities.\n\n[Emphasis added]\n\nAmong the illegal aliens in the database is 48-year-old Yehia Elham Badawi of Egypt, who has been convicted of robbery, aggravated assault, and several violent felonies. Also in the database is transgender illegal alien Nicol Alexandra Contreras-Suarez of Colombia, who was charged with stalking and raping a minor in New York.\n\nJimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez, a twice-deported illegal alien from Honduras, is similarly in the database after having been convicted of sex crimes against children. Gomez is currently facing charges of cruelty toward a child and lewd or lascivious acts with a minor.\n\nDHS has listed illegal alien Aldrin Guerrero-Munoz in the database as well after he served 32 years in prison for murdering his three-month-old son and assaulting another inmate in prison.\n\nMehran Makari Saheli, a 56-year-old Iranian national, is in the database after having been convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in Minneapolis. Saheli is also a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with ties to Hezbollah.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Email him at jbinder@breitbart.com.

      "full_content": "The Conservative Tariff Consensus Is Real\n\nThe conservative movement in America is now decisively in favor of tariffs.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed this transformation in the past. The post-war conservative movement was once dominated by self-styled free traders, as was the movement\u2019s political vehicle, the Republican Party. But opposition to tariffs is now confined to a legacy rump of the right, a small minority of conservatives and Republicans.\n\nA survey conducted by YouGov for the Economist in late October found that two-thirds of registered Republicans say tariffs should be kept at the new higher levels or raised even further. Twenty-eight percent want higher tariffs, and 38 percent are happy with current levels. Just 17 percent said tariffs should be reduced. Similarly, 68 percent of Trump voters say they favor keeping tariffs at current levels or raising them, including 31 percent who say tariffs should go higher still.\n\nSupport for President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have increased since early April\u2019s Liberation Day. Back then, 61 percent of Republicans and 66 percent of Trump voters said tariffs should go higher or be kept the same. That broke down as 43 percent saying we needed higher tariffs. Sixteen percent want lower tariffs.\n\nAnd support for higher tariffs has climbed significantly since the earliest days of the Trump administration. In the Economist poll taken between February 12 and 14, just 24 percent of Republicans said tariffs should go higher and 30 percent said they should be kept where they are. A quarter of Republicans said that tariffs should be cut. The breakdown among Trump voters was similar: 24 percent wanted higher tariffs, 34 percent wanted tariffs maintained where they were, and 23 percent wanted lower tariffs.\n\nThese surveys show that not only has support for Trump\u2019s tariffs increased and support for lower tariffs declined over the course of this year but that more Republicans and Trump voters are happy with the current level. A plurality think that Trump got tariffs just about right. Opposition to tariffs has trailed off even as tariffs have been hiked.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d event in the White House Rose Garden on April 2, 2025. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTariffs Are Now the Conservative Orthodoxy\n\nThe YouGov survey for the Economist recently asked about tariffs in a slightly different way. Instead of simply asking about whether tariffs should be raised, lowered, or kept the same, it asked Americans to assess the political position associated with the statement that tariffs should be raised on products imported from foreign countries. Sixty percent of Americans now say that support for tariff hikes is a conservative position, seven percent say it is a liberal position, 17 percent say it is neither liberal nor conservative (probably these are those same self-styled conservatives who oppose tariffs), and 15 percent say they don\u2019t know.\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting, however, is that an even greater number of people who identify as conservatives think support for raising tariffs is conservative. According to the survey, 69 percent of conservatives say it is conservative to support raising tariffs. Seventy-one percent of Trump voters agree.\n\nThis is a rare spot of agreement between conservatives and liberals. Among liberals, 68 percent say support for higher tariffs is a conservative position. Among Harris voters, 71 percent do, matching the share for Trump voters.\n\nRepublicans are slightly less likely to say that support for raising tariffs is conservative, at 59 percent. Similarly, 57 percent of moderates and 56 percent of registered independents identify tariff hiking with conservatives.\n\nWhat these numbers tell us is that support for tariffs is no longer a Trumpian deviation from conservative principles or mainstream Republican politics. The cause of tariffs is now thoroughly embedded in conservatism, and support for tariffs is a conservative principle. The Republican Party is the party of tariffs.\n\nFittingly, this is a return to an older set of principles that was long suppressed. As we wrote in July:\n\nFrom Presidents Abraham Lincoln to William McKinley to Calvin Coolidge, the Republican Party was the party of tariffs. It used them not only to protect American labor but to finance the federal government and build an industrial powerhouse. Between 1860 and 1930, the GOP won thirteen of fifteen presidential elections. The only Democratic victories \u2014 Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson \u2014 came amid Republican splits. During that era, while tariffs funded American development, the nation transformed from an agrarian economy into the world\u2019s preeminent manufacturing power.\n\nAbe Lincoln declared in 1844: \u201cGive us a protective tariff, and we will have the greatest nation on earth.\u201d For nearly all of the century that followed, Republicans and conservatives agreed. And now the party and the movement have come home, agreeing that tariffs can make America great again.",

Trump spoke about Beckstrom, who he said was looking down \u201cfrom Heaven, from above.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, I got a call that he got up from bed,\u201d Trump told the crowd about Wolfe. \u201cDo you believe that? He got up. He got up. Now, he didn\u2019t speak, he\u2019s not ready for that yet\u2026\u2026but, he got up and boy, they\u2019re so happy. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nTrump also revealed that he had called Wolfe\u2019s hospital room and spoken to his mother, Monica, who he described as \u201cthe most positive person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe night that he was so badly hit and the doctors gave him almost no chance, I call their hospital room and spoke to her, and she said, \u2018Sir, he\u2019ll be fine,'\u201d Trump shared, adding that Wolfe\u2019s mother kept insisting that her son would \u201cbe fine.\u201d\n\nThe President also spoke about how he had invited Wolfe\u2019s family to the Oval Office and Wolfe\u2019s mother told him, \u201cSir, he\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments come after a gunman, who officials have identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, opened fire near the Farragut West Metro Station. As a result of the shooting, the White House was placed on lockdown.\n\nDuring a press conference after the shooting, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeannine Pirro shared that Lakanwal had entered the United States in September 2021 under the Biden administration\u2019s Operation Allies Welcome.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe has also shared that Lakanwal had worked with the agency \u201cas a member of a partner force in Kandahar, Afghanistan.\u201d During an interview with Fox News, Ratcliffe also shared that Lakanwal \u201cand so many others\u2014should have never been allowed\u201d to come to the U.S.",

File image via Suspilne News\n\nOleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Ukrainian Energy Research Center, has in recent comments confirmed that resources for repairing damaged energy facilities have almost run out.\n\n\"Now I don't see the resources from either Ukrenergo, the generating or distribution companies to purchase the equipment they already need and will need in two or three months,\" he said in televised remarks.\n\n\"Ukraine may run out of equipment to restore its energy system if Russia continues to launch attacks,\" he has explained.\n\nThe new proposal for a fresh energy ceasefire comes as Moscow is still livid at recent attacks on tankers transporting Russian oil. And now a cargo vessel carrying grain from Crimea has been detained at Odessa port:\n\nUkrainian security officials have detained a cargo vessel in the port of Odesa that authorities say is part of Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cshadow fleet,\u201d the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said Wednesday. The ship, whose name was not disclosed, arrived under the flag of an African country to load a shipment of steel pipes. The captain and 16 crew members holding passports from unspecified Middle Eastern countries were on board at the time of the seizure. According to the SBU, the vessel illegally transported nearly 7,000 tons of Russian grain from annexed Crimea to North Africa in January 2021.\n\nVia Telegram\n\nThe SBU claims it found evidence of \"illegal operations in ports on temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory\" after a search of the ship.\n\nApparently Ukrainian authorities intend to seize the ship's cargo altogether, and transfer them Ukraine\u2019s Asset Recovery and Management Agency (ARMA), a government entity which deals with property linked to corruption or other crimes. So naturally, Moscow is not going to look kindly on fresh offers to mutually stop attacks on energy infrastructure.",

      "full_content": "President Donald Trump weighed in on a decades-old border water dispute on Monday, saying he would impose a 5 percent tariff hike on Mexican imports if the country fails to swiftly deliver the water it owes from the Rio Grande.\n\nThe ultimatum is designed to help struggling U.S. farmers, especially in Texas, amid alleged treaty violations over the past five years.\n\nIn a post on social media, Trump underscored an alleged 800,000 acre-feet debt from the recently ended cycle, demanding the release of 200,000 acre-feet before Dec. 31 and additional volumes shortly after.\n\nThe president highlighted the impact on Texas agriculture, where insufficient water undermines crop yields and livestock sustainability.\n\n\u201cAs of now, Mexico is not responding, and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social on Monday. \u201cThat is why I have authorized documentation to impose a 5% Tariff on Mexico if this water isn\u2019t released, IMMEDIATELY.\u201d\n\nAs Kimberley Hayek reports for The Epoch Times, Mexico has in the past cited significant drought conditions curtailing its capacity.\n\nThe 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty regulates shared resources from the Rio Grande, Colorado, and Tijuana rivers.\n\nFor the Rio Grande segment south of Fort Quitman, Texas, the agreement states that the United States would receive one-third of flows from six Mexican tributaries\u2014Conchos, San Diego, San Rodrigo, Escondido, Salado, and Las Vacas Arroyo\u2014with a guaranteed minimum average of 350,000 acre-feet per year, or 1.75 million over each five-year cycle. The agreement allotted Mexico two-thirds of those flows, as well as allocations from U.S. tributaries, including the Pecos and Devils rivers.\n\nIn April, Trump criticized Mexico, threatening tariffs or sanctions if the country failed to adhere to the terms of the treaty.\n\n\u201cMexico has been stealing the water from Texas farmers,\u201d he posted at the time, pledging to \u201ckeep escalating consequences, including tariffs and, maybe even sanctions, until Mexico honors the Treaty, and gives Texas the water they are owed!\u201d\n\nMexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum highlighted the ongoing drought but vowed to help resolve the issue. Mexico said it would draw from its reserves and increase flows from the six tributaries through October, as announced by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. IBWC data, however, showed deliveries came in at approximately 730,000 acre-feet by mid-2025, 42 percent short of the 1.75 million obligation.\n\nA history of lenient enforcement, hydrological changes, and rapid population increase in Mexico has been blamed for the current conditions.\n\nEvan Ellis, a Latin American studies professor at the U.S. Army War College, said the current situation can be attributed to \u201cyears of looking the other way\u201d by the United States.\n\nThe treaty allows for deferrals only during \u201cextraordinary drought,\u201d which is left undefined but requires repayment in the following cycle.\n\nIn March, the United States rejected Mexico\u2019s request for Colorado River water diversions to Tijuana, noting Rio Grande shortfalls. It is the first time the country has denied such a request under the treaty.\n\nThe Texas agricultural sector depends on consistent water supplies, and the allocation shortfalls have led members of Congress to introduce bills proposing fund withholdings until remedies are secured.",

      "full_content": "On Tuesday Evening, President Donald Trump traveled to Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, to deliver remarks on the economy.\n\nPresident Trump began his remarks by wishing the crowd a Merry Christmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n.@POTUS in PA: \"I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible Commonwealth, with so many proud, hardworking American patriots... Let me begin by wishing each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas!\" \ud83c\udf84\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/cfUwmgUmzI \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nHe touted the notable decrease in gas prices since he took office.\n\n.@POTUS: \"We're right now drilling more oil than we've ever done \u2014 ever before... It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon.\" \ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/ltvNEbYkwo \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nHe also emphasized the progress on wages:\n\n.@POTUS: \"Under Biden, real wages plummeted by $3,000 a year. Under Trump, the typical factory worker has seen their wages increase by more than $1,300... For construction workers, it\u2019s $1,800 up... For miners, their wages went up $3,300.\" pic.twitter.com/C8CDUDGhCy \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nAnd on groceries:\n\n.@POTUS in Pennsylvania: \"Rent prices are down. Dairy prices are coming down very strongly. The cost of Thanksgiving turkeys was down by 33% compared to the Biden-era [high].\" pic.twitter.com/BVcEtTFXaa \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nPresident Trump also emphasized how he wants to approach (and improve) health insurance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n.@POTUS: \"Under Obamacare, trillions of dollars were given directly to health insurance companies...I want to give billions of dollars directly to the people...I want to give NOTHING to the insurance companies...We want you to go out and buy your own health insurance.\" pic.twitter.com/Yrr3dmZOmF \u2014 Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 10, 2025\n\nIn conjunction with the speech, the White House issued a statement highlighting the progress made in terms of lowering costs since Trump (re)took office 10 months ago \u2014 and promising more relief to come:\n\nSince taking office, President Donald J. Trump has made substantial progress reversing the inflation and cost-of-living disaster he inherited from the recklessness of the Biden Administration. Inflation has been cut by more than half, gas prices have fallen sharply, real wages are growing again, and key household expenses are finally heading in the right direction.\n\n\n\nBut President Trump is also clear: there is still important work ahead to ensure every American feels the full benefit of lower costs. While Democrats attempt to con Americans into believing they\u2019re the champions of affordability, the reality is that Democrats created the problem \u2014 and President Trump is stopping at nothing to fix it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement detailed the progress made on a number of economic fronts, including:\n\nInflation:\n\nUnder Biden, inflation averaged nearly 5% and hit 9.1% amid the worst inflation crisis in decades \u2014 fueled by the Radical Left\u2019s obsession with spending.\n\n\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s second term, inflation has dropped to an average of just 2.7% \u2014 the critical first step in reversing Democrats\u2019 cost-of-living disaster. In fact, under President Trump, Americans have even seen the first overall price decline since 2020.\n\nWages:\n\nUnder Biden, Americans workers lost over $2,900 in purchasing power because inflation rose faster than wages.\n\n\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s second term \u2014 even after accounting for higher prices \u2014 Americans\u2019 real wages have grown by nearly 4% \u2014 or nearly $700 \u2014 and are on track to grow by nearly $1,200 after his first full year in office.\n\nGas Prices:\n\nUnder Biden, gas prices were the highest they had ever been \u2014 even after he drained our strategic reserves to artificially decrease prices.\n\n\n\nIn President Trump\u2019s second term, gas prices have fallen to the lowest average price in 1,682 days and Americans on track to spend the lowest amount of their disposable income on gas in the last two decades. In fact, average gas prices have dipped below $3 per gallon in 36 states, below $2.75 per gallon in 20 states, and below $2.50 per gallon in five states \u2014 with prices below $2 per gallon at some stations in at least four states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also detailed progress on housing costs and groceries, and noted other economic wins like the tax cuts included in the One Big Beautiful Bill, deregulation, investment in the U.S., and deficit reduction.\n\nThe statement concluded with this:\n\nThe Trump Administration will not rest until the high prices that resulted from Democrat policies are fully reined in. We\u2019re making progress \u2014 and the best is yet to come.\n\nIf \"affordability\" is the 2025 version of James Carville's \"It's the economy, stupid,\" President Trump and his administration are dialed in on making sure it's a message that becomes a winning one for the president and for Republicans \u2014 for Americans \u2014 as we head into the midterms.\n\nEditor's Note: Help RedState continue to tell the truth about the Trump administration's accomplishments as we continue to usher in the Golden Era of America.

Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, declaring that \u201cno one has ever deserved that honor more\u201d and that \u201cno person in the world has done more for peace over the past year.\u201d\n\nMeeting at the U.S. Capitol, Johnson hosted Ohana for a bilateral session in which the two speakers signed a formal letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee and launched an effort to rally speakers and presidents of parliaments worldwide to join the nomination. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise also took part in the meeting.\n\nIn a press release announcing the move, Johnson said that by restoring the American doctrine of \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d President Trump \u201cmade history by ending conflicts and encouraging order around the globe,\u201d insisting that \u201cno one has ever deserved that honor more.\u201d\n\nOhana, calling the initiative \u201ca cause that is just, moral, and as right as any can be,\u201d said there is \u201cnot a single person in the world who has done more for peace over the past year than President Trump, and no one more deserving of recognition for the efforts and the results that have saved the lives of so many people around the world, including in Israel.\u201d\n\nThe joint letter \u2014 addressed to the Nobel Committee in Oslo and signed by Johnson and Ohana as speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Israeli Knesset \u2014 presents Trump as \u201can extraordinary leader whose pursuit of peace has changed the world,\u201d and stresses that, for the first time in modern history, parliamentary leaders are uniting \u201cin one voice\u201d behind his candidacy.\n\nThe pair says they will now circulate the text globally and invite counterparts to add their signatures ahead of the January 31, 2026, nomination deadline.\n\nLaying out the case, the letter cites eight specific diplomatic achievements it credits to Trump: his 20-Point Peace Plan for Gaza; the Abraham Accords; a ceasefire between India and Pakistan; a truce and peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia; reconciliation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda; a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia; economic normalization between Serbia and Kosovo; and Trump\u2019s role in easing tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia.\n\nThe document says this record reflects \u201cexceptional statesmanship and uncommon courage in confronting long-standing hostilities with vision, creativity, and resolve.\u201d\n\nThe speakers argue that Trump\u2019s mediation has \u201cchanged the world\u201d by bringing an end to bloody conflicts in \u201cno fewer than eight regions\u201d and by securing the return of all living hostages from Hamas captivity as part of his Gaza framework \u2014 an achievement Johnson has described as a \u201chistoric moment\u201d that \u201cdeserves enormous credit and recognition on the world stage.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, they contend that under the Nobel\u2019s founding principles, \u201cno individual did more to advance peace in 2025 than President Trump,\u201d and that \u201cfew, if any, have done more in history to advance the cause of peace \u2014 and none are more worthy of this honor.\u201d\n\nJohnson framed the new push as the continuation of an effort he and Ohana first announced in mid-October, when the Israeli speaker told Trump in a special Knesset session that he would work with the House speaker to rally parliaments around the world behind a Nobel bid, declaring, \u201cPresident Trump, you are the President of Peace.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Johnson told reporters in Washington that \u201cno one has ever deserved that prize more,\u201d vowing to coordinate a broad international campaign among his counterparts.\n\nThe October appeals from civil society and political leaders set the early stage.\n\nOn October 6, families of Israeli hostages \u2014 together with relatives of those already returned \u2014 wrote to the Norwegian Nobel Committee \u201cwith momentous urgency,\u201d urging it to award President Trump the Peace Prize and crediting his diplomacy with making possible what \u201cmany said was impossible.\u201d\n\nDays later, on October 9, world leaders, lawmakers, and public figures amplified the push in a separate appeal, arguing that \u201cno leader has done more for peace\u201d and warning that if Trump did not receive the prize, \u201cno one deserves it.\u201d\n\nThose letters landed in the final days before the committee made its decision.\n\nAt that point, Trump\u2019s Gaza framework was still being finalized, and the last hostages remained in Hamas captivity.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, that framework was implemented: all remaining living hostages held in Gaza were brought home, and \u2014 under the ceasefire and hostage-exchange arrangement \u2014 all known bodies but one were returned, as part of what officials in Jerusalem and Washington have described as a broader effort to end the war and lock in a more stable regional architecture.\n\nWith Phase One now essentially complete \u2014 short of the single remaining body still held in Gaza \u2014 officials say the process is shifting toward Phase Two of Trump\u2019s 20-Point Peace Plan, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled to meet President Trump on December 29 to discuss the transition and outline the next steps.\n\nOn October 10, however, the Nobel Committee announced that it would award the 2025 peace prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a move widely seen in Israel as a snub of Trump\u2019s record and of the appeals filed in the days prior.\n\nWithin hours of the Oslo decision, Israel Prize laureate Ronny Douek moved on a different track, formally nominating Trump for the Israel Prize for Lifetime Achievement and Special Contribution to Society and the State \u2014 the country\u2019s highest civilian honor, often described as its \u201cIsraeli Nobel.\u201d\n\nIn his nomination, Douek pointed to Trump\u2019s then-ongoing efforts to secure the return of the hostages and bring the Gaza war to an end \u201cin a way that will guarantee security and stability for Israel,\u201d even as the captives were still being held, and urged Israel to honor him on the upcoming Independence Day.\n\nHe framed the case broadly, arguing that Trump \u201cacted with great determination, courage, and a deep love for the people of Israel,\u201d that he \u201cpaved a new path of hope and regional partnership,\u201d and that thanks to his direct leadership, historic peace agreements were achieved, Israel\u2019s security interests were preserved, and \u201cgenuine hope for a better future\u201d was established.\n\nDouek\u2019s letter also pointed back to first-term milestones that, in his view, set the stage: U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and the 2018 embassy move; recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights in 2019; and the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, later joined by additional Arab states.\n\nTaken together with Trump\u2019s current diplomacy, he argued, that record makes the Israel Prize the natural venue to recognize a leader he called \u201cmore committed than any other in our generation\u201d to Israel\u2019s security and to peace in the region.\n\nThe Nobel panel has stood by its choice of Machado, citing her struggle to restore democracy in Venezuela.\n\nBut Johnson and Ohana say the coming year offers the committee a fresh opportunity \u2014 and that Trump\u2019s record over the past year alone, capped by the hostage deal and Gaza framework, fits Alfred Nobel\u2019s mandate to recognize those who have done \u201cthe most or the best work\u201d to advance peace and fraternity between nations.\n\nTheir new parliamentary campaign is explicitly designed to put that question back on the committee\u2019s desk for 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, recognition of Trump\u2019s peacemaking has broadened well beyond the Nobel track.\n\nOn Friday, FIFA President Gianni Infantino awarded Trump the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize at the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, calling him a leader whose \u201cexceptional and extraordinary actions\u201d have promoted peace and unity across the globe \u2014 from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to India and Pakistan \u2014 and reading a citation crediting him with making \u201cthe world a safer place.\u201d\n\nTrump, calling the honor \u201ctruly one of the great honors of my life,\u201d said that \u201cbeyond the awards \u2026 we saved millions and millions of lives.\u201d\n\nFor now, Johnson and Ohana say their immediate goal is to convert what has been a patchwork of letters, endorsements, and symbolic honors into a single, coordinated parliamentary effort \u2014 one that, in their words, reflects \u201cdeep respect and sincere regard\u201d for a president they present as uniquely responsible for \u201ca monumental stride toward the realization of peace in our time,\u201d and that will test whether the Nobel institution is prepared to follow suit.\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

NY Post Design\n\n\u201cSwitching to Calibri achieved nothing except the degradation of the department\u2019s official correspondence,\u201d Rubio wrote in an \u201caction request,\u201d obtained by Reuters and the New York Times.\n\nTimes New Roman has long been a classic letterhead in books, featuring narrower and more formally shaped letters relative to Calibri.\n\nThe State Department used Times New Roman as its official font starting in 2004, when it shifted away from Courier New, a typeface frequently used in screenplays with its monospaced letters.\n\nRubio reportedly dinged the Blinken-era switch to Calibri as \u201cwasteful\u201d and woke in his Dec. 9 cable to personnel.\n\n\u201cTo restore decorum and professionalism to the Department\u2019s written work products and abolish yet another wasteful DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility] program, the Department is returning to Times New Roman as its standard typeface,\u201d Rubio reportedly wrote.\n\n\u201cThis formatting standard aligns with the President\u2019s One Voice for America\u2019s Foreign Relations directive, underscoring the Department\u2019s responsibility to present a unified, professional voice in all communications.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the Blinken-era switch to Calibri, the State Department had pointed to studies suggesting the wider typeface was more readable for people with visual disabilities \u2014 a conclusion that has split experts.\n\nDuring President Trump\u2019s second term, his team has sought to scrap Biden-era diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies within the government and encourage the private sector to do the same.",

But the basic idea was the same: to establish whose clubhouse it really is.\n\nFor an emblem of player-commissioner relations in the NFL today, the New York Times reporter Ken Belson writes, look to the \u201cRoger Goodell Bro Hug.\u201d Every spring, the newest first-round picks bound across the NFL draft stage and wrap their arms around the commissioner. Sometimes they lift him off his feet. A hug Goodell shared with Baltimore Ravens draftee Malaki Starks this past April lasted 21 seconds. Speaking to Belson, an agent laments the annual show of affection for management, though he can\u2019t help but admire the bleak triumph it signals: \u201cYou have to give kudos to the NFL for making it that way.\u201d\n\nBelson\u2019s new book, Every Day Is Sunday: How Jerry Jones, Robert Kraft, and Roger Goodell Turned the NFL into a Cultural & Economic Juggernaut, is a sobering account of how the NFL made the world this way, its way, totally in its image. Today, the football fan wakes to kickoffs in London and Berlin; she dozes off to the drawl of Cris Collinsworth, whose network pays $2 billion a year for the rights to Sunday Night Football. In 2024, NFL games accounted for 72 of the 100 highest-rated broadcasts on American TV. The year before, without the election and Olympics to account for, that number was 93.\n\nNFL revenues have more than tripled since Belson began covering the league's inner workings in 2013. Since then, the NFL has glided through obstacles: damning concussion research, increased attention on players arrested for domestic violence, high-profile player protests, tawdry owner scandals, the rise of streaming services, and overtures from private equity. In the book\u2019s acknowledgements, Belson recalls his Times editor\u2019s early mandate to cover the NFL \u201cas a really, really big business.\u201d Off the field were the real stories. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not at whatever folks consider to be the \u2018big game\u2019 of the week.\u201d\n\nThe Goodell presented in Every Day Is Sunday might be flattered by that kind of attention. At a 2010 meeting, he presented owners with a then-unthinkable financial target, to grow league revenue from $8 billion to $25 billion by 2027. In doing so, Goodell set his sights far beyond the little Sports Tuesday section on B8. \u201cRoger doesn\u2019t view the other leagues as competition,\u201d an NFL staffer tells Belson. \u201cHe wants to be mentioned with Disney and the Vatican, these massive institutions.\u201d Now in his 20th season as commissioner, Goodell has won his bosses gobs of money with what Belson paints as both political savvy and quiet ambition. The $25 billion vision will indeed come to pass in a couple of years, but the prophet won\u2019t be satisfied. When a friend emailed him the stat about 93 of 100 broadcasts, Goodell replied, \u201cWe have a couple of more spots to fill!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a story to read in the book\u2019s negative space: If Goodell, Kraft, and Jones have built the NFL as we know it now, it\u2019s been built almost entirely on ownership\u2019s terms. When they are drawn at all, the lines between labor and management are quickly smudged by a slick league PR apparatus. Rarely these days are the lines drawn by the sport\u2019s most prominent players. (Per the book\u2019s index, Magary, Drew is mentioned once, the same number of times as Mahomes, Patrick.)\n\nGoodell became commissioner in 2006, months after the NFL signed a CBA granting players 52 percent of league revenue after deductions. Owners quickly soured on the split. (\u201cA mean mother,\u201d Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called it.) In 2008, they exercised an opt-out clause to shorten the deal by a year. The 2011 lockout that followed marked the start of a prolonged\u2014and maybe still active\u2014period of backlash. For enduring labor\u2019s brief edge, the billionaires were owed reparations. As then-Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson put it at a 2010 owners meeting, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stick together and take back our league.\u201d That phrase, \u201cour league,\u201d confirms a suspicion voiced in the book by Jeff Saturday, a lead NFLPA player rep at the time: \u201cI feel like at times Jerry [Richardson] felt like the owners had created this thing as opposed to the other way around.\u201d The eventual 2011 deal reduced players' share of league revenue to 47 percent. Saturday and Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, christened the end of the lockout with a hug.\n\nRob Carr/Getty Images\n\nEvery Day Is Sunday brought to mind John Helyar\u2019s 1994 classic Lords of the Realm, a dishy history of labor wins in baseball. (Come back! It\u2019s interesting! I swear!) Helyar finds an easy hero in the union boss Marvin Miller, whose gift for \u201cconsciousness-raising\u201d made the MLBPA the gold standard. Miller turned \u201ccompliant peons to budding rebels\u201d with a message so simple and eternal that today a raw milk-drinking, de-blooded, re-blooded red-ass superstar slugger getting Wobbly just scans as basic gene expression. \u201cYou are the game,\u201d Miller told the players. \u201cWithout you there is no game.\u201d That spirit won MLB players free agency, better pensions, and the right to salary arbitration. Bit by bit, they clawed power away from \u201cthe Lords.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, these two books tell opposite stories, but it might be truer to call them different parts of the same story. In Belson\u2019s sequel\u2014spoiler!\u2014the Lords strike back. A chapter on the 2017 player protests is both instructive and nauseating as a peek into the NFL's corporate machinery. After players knelt during the national anthem in protest of police brutality, Goodell arranged a meeting between players and owners. One of the players was Anquan Boldin, whose goals here were not particularly lofty. Before the meeting, he told Goodell he wanted the owners to join the players in calling for legislative reform. \u201cIf an owner or the commissioner goes into a meeting with me, the conversation changes from a photo op to talking about true issues,\u201d he said.\n\nBoldin repeated this wish to owners in the meeting, a recording of which was sent to Belson:\n\nLater in the meeting, Boldin was more direct. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018players are being militant,\u2019 we\u2019re looked at as villains,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can have owners come and say, nationally, that no, they aren\u2019t, they\u2019re Americans, they care about the cities they\u2019re in, they care about these issues, we care about these issues, we\u2019re behind them, we\u2019re gonna educate ourselves about these issues, and we\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re gonna push forward. That changes us as a nation.\u201d\n\nAny genuine desires Boldin and the players voiced in that meeting would re-emerge from a Park Avenue boardroom as the Inspire Change initiative. Everyone was allowed to write \u201cEnd Racism\u201d on their cleats. Tension bubbled up again the next year, when owners pushed to officially mandate standing for the anthem. But that story ends tidily, with Kraft recruiting Jay-Z to produce the Super Bowl halftime show. It ends also with an amendment to the NFL game operations manual: \u201cAll teams and league personnel on the field shall stand and show respect for the flag and anthem.\u201d Earlier this year, the \u201cEnd Racism\u201d messaging was quietly scrapped.\n\nInterviewed for Ben Lindbergh\u2019s Lords of the Realm retrospective at The Ringer in 2019, Helyar noted a recent \u201ccreep toward owners\u201d in baseball. Belson\u2019s book warns that labor peace only means it\u2019s time to get back on defense. That can be hard in sports, where the labor force is trained to take things one game at a time. Owners like to leverage the brevity of most athletic careers to paint the real fight as one among labor, imagined between stars and scrubs. In an Atlanta Braves investor call this past June, Manfred copped to the clubhouse tour strategy: \u201cI usually try to avoid the high-earning guy at this point and find a younger player and say, \u2018Look, if you\u2019re one of the 10 percent, it\u2019s a great deal. But if you\u2019re the other 90, it ain\u2019t so good.\u2019\u201d Collier, an MVP candidate who co-founded the offseason league Unrivaled, has been charged with having a conflict of interest that would make her less sensitive to (or even the beneficiary of) a WNBA lockout.\n\nWhy do Kraft, Jones, and Goodell win so much? One trait they share is a stubborn belief in their own permanence. If Jones should ever die, visitors to the Dallas Cowboys' stadium may see him live on in hologram form; AI Jerry pops up at the end of the \u201cOwners Experience Tour.\u201d Kraft and Jones both star in multi-part docu-hagiographies, available to stream. Even in their eighties, neither owner speaks much of succession, and friends of Goodell\u2019s say they have never heard him mention retirement either. Every day is Sunday, and it will be forever.\n\nMiller asked players to think on exactly these terms, to remember that their cause transcends any one life or contract. \u201cThis could be my last year in baseball, and if the strike lasts the entire season and I\u2019ve played my last game, well, it will be painful,\u201d Giants player rep Willie Mays tells his fellow reps in a union meeting in Lords of the Realm, during the 1972 strike. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t hang together, everything we\u2019ve worked for will be lost.\u201d There\u2019s another means of immortality, not the hologram or the docuseries, just the simple vow to keep an eye out for someone else so they can one day do the same. When he signed a record contract with the New York Yankees in 2019, ace Gerrit Cole thanked Curt Flood and Miller, labor heroes he\u2019d first learned about from a veteran teammate in Pittsburgh. Of particular concern to Collier, she said in her press conference, were the underpaid stars coming up in the league, the ones four or five years younger. Harper has already signed the last big contract he will ever sign. We\u2019ll all die one day, but there\u2019s still some part to play, some piece of the fight to wage. You can hug it out, or you can pick up a bat.",

      "full_content": "Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios are participating in a Battle Of The Sexes match this month in Dubai. Somehow, the sentence I'm about to write is even more dispiriting than the one that precedes it: Kyrgios and Sabalenka spent a half an hour on Tuesday promoting this match on Piers Morgan's show.\n\nThe newsworthy portion of the conversation arrived about halfway through, when Morgan turned to the topic of trans participation in sports. \"Martina Navratilova, a former No. 1 like yourself, says it's wrong for the Women's Tennis Association to allow trans women to compete in its events, do you agree with that?\" Morgan asked. Sabalenka replied:\n\nThat's a tricky question. I have nothing to do against [trans people], but I feel like they still got a huge advantage over the woman, and I think it's just not fair to the woman to basically face biologically a man. It's not fair, the woman been working her whole life to reach her limit, and then she has to face a man, which is biologically much stronger, so for me I don't agree with this kind of stuff in sport.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Kyrgios said that Sabalenka had \"hit the nail on the head.\"\n\nThis is all standard fare that you've heard from anti-trans activists hundreds of times by now, but this particular conversation was made more interesting by where it went next. Immediately after agreeing with Kyrgios and Sabalenka, Morgan brought up an incident from earlier this year when Ukrainian tennis player Marta Kostyuk implied that Sabalenka has an advantage over her because of her size and potentially \"higher level of testosterone.\"\n\nHere was an interesting moment. Morgan, totally on accident (he asked this question in order to tee up a punchline built around putting Sabalenka's bikini pictures on screen), had plowed the conversation into a queasy and inconvenient truth that anti-trans agitators refuse to grapple with: In the absence of any actual high-level trans athletes attempting to compete, those who most prominently suffer when trans bans are put into place are cis athletes who do not conform to a particular image of femininity. In other words, if anyone currently on the tour is going to end up being subjected to gross speculation and invasive sex testing under a trans ban, it's players who look like Sabalenka.\n\nNone of this, nor the fact that they had just finished talking about how physical advantages can undermine the competitive fairness of their sport, seemed to enter into Sabalaneka's or Kyrgios's heads as they gave their response about Kostyuk:\n\nSabalenka: All I hear here is just excuses. And it's actually quite funny because she's a strong a girl, she probably has more muscles than I do. She looks fit and strong, and I think that's not the case in all of the matches she lost against top players. Kyrgios: We kind of debunked that. Someone like John Isner or Ivo Karlovi\u0107 was a fair bit bigger than Roger Federer, but that doesn't really\u2014 Morgan: Yeah, you're always going to get physical differences between players, obviously\u2014 Sabalenka: I think that's not the key in sports.\n\nThe most important ingredient in maintaining a commitment to anti-trans bigotry is never stopping to think about anything for more than two seconds.",

      "full_content": "It's the most wonderful time of year, and we at Defector are proud to bring back our series discussing some of the most, uh, available holiday movies.\n\nSabrina Imbler: Thanks so much Kelsey and Alex for trudging through this \u201cfilm\u201d with me.\n\nAlex Sujong Laughlin: I am so excited to be here to talk about one man\u2019s sexual tension with Santa.\n\nKelsey McKinney: Hello. I am here to discuss the queer film My Secret Santa, is this the correct place?\n\nSabrina: You are in the right place! Before we dive into the movie, I have to ask. Have either of you ever cross-dressed to commit workplace fraud?\n\nAlex: I really had to sit for a moment and think about it but I\u2019m gonna lean toward no for now.\n\nKelsey: NOT YET! I\u2019m hoping to in the future.\n\nSabrina: 2026 goals! I did not realize when I chose this film that My Secret Santa is essentially a remake of Mrs. Doubtfire except it\u2019s Santa.\n\nKelsey: It also has shades of She\u2019s the Man/Twelfth Night! All the classics of the cross-dressing for employment genre!\n\nSabrina: My Secret Santa opens with our intrepid hero, Taylor Jacobson, getting fired from her job, Fantine-style, which leaves her in dire financial straits. Not only does she need to pay her overdue rent, she also \"needs\" to pay for presumably a very expensive snowboarding school for her daughter Zoey. This was when the movie first fell apart for me. I thought about that dril tweet where someone is like \u201ccan someone help me budget, my family is dying\u201d and it\u2019s like $200 on groceries, $500 on rent, $5,000 on candles. Here, private snowboarding school is candles.\n\nKelsey: One thing I love about movies of this caliber is that you never know what is going to be important. The opening scene of this movie is her very carefully checking decorated cookies for flaws and pulling out the other ones. It\u2019s implied that she\u2019s pretty good at the cookie job and also that she likes it. But guess what? Cookies are not relevant to this movie at all! We never hear about the cookies again! It was all just a job she could lose.\n\nAlex: As the movie went on I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the very first moment in the movie where she picks a Santa cookie out of the lineup and is like, \u201cHe\u2019s depressed!!\u201d That\u2019s called foreshadowing.\n\nKelsey: Also, that Santa cookie looks identical to all the other ones. It\u2019s also called projection.\n\nSabrina: I got where Taylor was coming from, because it seems no one in this small Christmas town has ever seen a therapist, at least one that was not Santa.\n\nKelsey: Don\u2019t be silly, Sabs. You do not need therapy when you have Christmas Spirit.\n\nSabrina: Soooooo true babe. Luckily Taylor has a plan to make some money. She goes to a used record store and tries to sell her collection of vinyl\u2014she only makes $150, which would probably pay for approximately one hour of elite snowboarding school\u2014where she runs into what we are supposed to believe is an alluring eligible bachelor: local hotel heir Matthew Layne.\n\nAlex: It\u2019s moments like these when I fully grasp the width of the chasm between my opinion of a \u201chot man\u201d and Christmas Movie Hot Man. He is fine. The best part about him I think is that he is a huge fan of Screaming Kittens, which turns out to be ... Taylor\u2019s old band?!\n\nKelsey: At this point, the movie has been on for like 15 minutes and there are already so many things happening: old band, potential love interest, snowboarding school, rent problems, fired from job, and also the approach of Christmas, obviously.\n\nAlex: I have this in my notes: \"'You can\u2019t really be a rock star and a mom at the same time' HELL YEAH.\u201d I think I was excited to have the thesis statement spelled out so quickly. I was hoping for a musical performance at some point and I was not disappointed.\n\nSabrina: Matthew asks Taylor out on the traditional adult Christmas date\u2014drinking hot chocolate while leaving room for Jesus\u2014and she cruelly rebuffs him because she cannot be a rock star and a mom and a girlfriend at the same time, obviously.\n\nAlex: Hot chocolate does not exist in the world except for in Christmas movies, but because of this movie I have been craving hot chocolate constantly and I\u2019ve already had it three times.\n\nKelsey: Now, the movie gives us even more plot! The ski resort where Taylor\u2019s daughter has to go to ski school in order to become an Olympic snowboarder(??) even though she is already 16, is a ski resort that is owned by the love interest\u2019s dad. And his dad is mad at him because he already spent so much money crashing his car into a building in Italy(??). So his dad names him the General Manager of the resort, usurping poor Tia Mowry who was in line for the job.\n\nAlex: THRILLING Tia Mowry appearance! This led me down a rabbit hole to confirm that it appears she and Tamara have reconciled in some way so nobody panic.\n\nSabrina: Oh my god, that\u2019s a real Christmas miracle! Twitches lives!! I was pissed off by how this movie treated Tia\u2019s character. She is the only person in this world who got her job without the influence of nepotism, and she seems to be really good at it. Because of this the movie has decided she is an evil careerist mom and therefore the closest this movie comes to a villain.\n\nTaylor learns from her gay brother (more on that later) that the snowboarding tuition is half-off for Sun Peaks employees, so she goes to the hotel to try and get a job. But Tia informs her that the only job they are hiring for is Santa. Alas, Taylor is too beautiful and too female to play Santa!\n\nAlex: It\u2019s at this point that I\u2019m like ... why are you only considering this right now, seemingly two days before this camp starts? If your daughter is this snowboarding savant and you live in this ski town, would this not have come up sooner?? But these movies are not for airtight storytelling. They are the product of someone putting a bunch of nouns and verbs into a hat and covering their eyes as they draw three.\n\nKelsey: I also just do not believe for a second that being Santa at $2000 a week is going to cover half of a snowboarding camp and your rent backlog. Mountain sports are for rich people! And Taylor cannot even pay her rent or get her daughter a new snowboard. Maybe let\u2019s cool it on the snowboarding camp. Or, we as the audience should be given more context about how good Taylor\u2019s daughter is at snowboarding because the way it\u2019s presented in the movie, it seems like she just thinks it\u2019s cool. And unfortunately only rich kids get to do everything they think is cool!\n\nSabrina: Kelsey I was so confused by that. How has her daughter been snowboarding for so long? Has Taylor just been spending 80 percent of her income on snowboarding? Zoey seemed too well-adjusted to be a pro athlete. But fortunately Taylor\u2019s gay brother has a plan: he and his husband will create an elaborate Santa drag disguise for her. This also made no sense financially. The level of detail of the prosthetic Santa mask, the rich velvet of the costume, all of this money could have simply gone to snowboarding school. Or, frankly, to a financial planner for Taylor, to give her the cold hard truth!\n\nAlex: Just to note that I believe Taylor is 100 percent someone who refers to her brother as \u201cmy gay brother\u201d so that is how I\u2019ll be referring to him. Anyway, somehow her gay brother has all the supplies and technology to make professional-level prosthetics for the face and body.\n\nSabrina: When you\u2019re gay they teach you that in gay school, I think.\n\nKelsey: I did really like the Mission: Impossible sequence where they scanned her head with a 3-D scanner and then printed a new face for her as Santa which the gay brother and gay brother-in-law then painted to look realistic. They filled the Santa belly with lentils. Iconique.\n\nAlex: The mask they make is absolutely terrifying. The final product is \u2026 kind of convincing? Through the screen? But I have a hard time believing it wouldn\u2019t feel uncanny valley up close, so that was in the back of my mind the rest of the movie whenever she was in Santa\u2014or rather, Hugh Mann\u2014costume.\n\nSabrina: The mask clearly works on Hotel Heir Matthew and General Manager Tia, because they hire Taylor as Santa. She tells them her name is Hugh \u2026 Mann. This raised many questions for me. How did she not think ahead to come up with a fake name? What on earth does her W2 look like?\n\nKelsey: What kind of passport did she submit!! The Santa job should be cash under the table anyway, in my opinion.\n\nAlex: Mr. Mann!!! It feels like a drag performance at this point. And the gender excitement just keeps going because then she takes a call in the women\u2019s bathroom thinking it\u2019s empty, but of course a toilet flushes and an old lady comes out. The tone is very Ha ha! It\u2019s a man in the women\u2019s bathroom! Isn\u2019t that silly?!\n\nSabrina: Yeah I refuse to engage with or even imagine this movie\u2019s perspective on trans politics. But the next bathroom Taylor finds herself in is a steamy one. She is led by Chief Elf Jimmy to the men\u2019s locker room to change into her Santa fit, where she runs into a nude Matthew Layne. What proceeds is maybe the most homoerotic scene of the movie\u2019s many homoerotic scenes. Midway through dressing, Matthew asks Taylor-as-Hugh to tie his tie for him. I genuinely thought they were going to bone, or something close to it.\n\nAlex: When Matthew Layne is gazing into Hugh Mann\u2019s eyes and saying he just feels like he can talk to him \u2026 wow, it was a truly romantic moment.\n\nKelsey: To me, it is beautiful that the sexual chemistry between Matthew and Taylor exists even when she is dressed in a giant Santa suit. I love love. What I do not love is that one of the clues the movie plants that Hugh Mann is Taylor is a kind of chapstick that has a unicorn head on the top of it that we are supposed to believe Taylor uses all the time.\n\nSabrina: Honestly I felt like the only times Matthew and Taylor had chemistry is when she was in character as Hugh Mann. Maybe it has to do with the way \u201cstraight\u201d men are able to be intimate in a \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d way in these movies that a heterosexual couple simply cannot. But I was genuinely titillated by the Daddy-Son dynamic between them, and I couldn\u2019t help but fantasize about another Christmas movie where the real Santa finds love in a locker room.\n\nKelsey: No, you\u2019re totally right. There was almost no chemistry when Taylor was dressed as herself. I think part of that is because her character description was mainly \u201cuptight\u201d and \u201cscared.\u201d\n\nAlex: And also when she is Hugh Mann, she is also daddy, which is what Matthew desperately needs.\n\nSabrina: Holy shit. Yes. Yes!!!\n\nKelsey: WOW! Freud! It all makes sense. He just wants to get a drink with his dad and be loved by him.\n\nSabrina: I\u2019m reeling.\n\nAlex: I\u2019m gonna be honest, this is the point in the movie where I wrote \u201cit\u2019s giving mulan\u201d and my notes ended because I was hootin and hollerin at the TV. Speeding through the plot though, Hugh becomes the resort\u2019s Santa and is really bad at it at first because she\u2019s too practical, and then she has a heart to heart with Matthew at a bar.\n\nKelsey: My notes at this point say FLAMING CANDY CANES. Because I was very excited by the drink that is brought out to Matthew and Hugh Mann that has crushed candy canes on the side of it and some kind of floating flammable topper shot. No one drinks these because they light Hugh Mann\u2019s beard on fire, but I liked seeing them.\n\nSabrina: After Taylor tries to give a pep talk to her daughter (while dressed as Santa), Zoey tells Santa that all she wants for Christmas is for her mom to get a boyfriend. This changes Taylor\u2019s whole approach to being Santa from being uptight and practical to becoming a kind of therapist to the many children who wish for something less material than presents.\n\nKelsey: More good evidence in my opinion that we should not be risking our life\u2019s savings on snowboarding school!! Your Christmas wish is for your mom to have a boyfriend?\n\nAlex: Also, just a small note on the topic of Taylor\u2019s financial literacy: I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s wearing a Canada Goose coat in one scene?!? Those are like $1000???\n\nSabrina: And I feel like that\u2019s still less expensive than this Santa drag getup! Which, by the way, has already been repaired twice after the fire incident, and another incident when an overzealous child bursts Hugh Mann\u2019s belly leading him to gush lentils like a burst artery. This was a fun bit of body horror for me, imagining a kind of man who is made of lentils. But soon we come to what was, for me, the absolute worst part of the movie. A young girl who stutters comes up to Hugh Mann and says her Christmas wish is to not stutter anymore, and then Hugh Mann tells her that stuttering can be fixed with the power of song, and then they all sing \u201cJingle Bells\u201d together (in my opinion the worst Christmas song!) and the girl doesn\u2019t stutter and her mom tells her she\u2019s proud of her and the moment goes viral on the internet and this is all used as evidence that Matthew has now become good at general managing a hotel.\n\nKelsey: I hated this part, to be honest. Although, it did lead me to googling whether or not singing helps stuttering and apparently it does help. Also the website it goes viral on is called \"HAPPENED.\" We see it on a computer screen.\n\nSabrina: That reminds me of when Tia Mowry is doing investigative journalism on Hugh Mann and looks him up on a search engine called \u201cLook Path\u201d and then again on a website called \u201cJobization.\u201d I had fun imagining what terrible tech billionaires ruled over this world of Christmas.\n\nAlex: I could tell we were on the path toward a zany party scene where both Taylor and Hugh are invited and expected to make appearances, and I was impatient to get there.\n\nSabrina: The party where Hugh and Taylor both have to be there is a good bit of fun. She has to run back and forth to the bathroom to change in and out of Santa drag with the help of her gay brother, who is also really hungry for some reason? Why didn\u2019t he eat before this?\n\nKelsey: I was dying at the hunger subplot. Why are you so hungry? Why do you want your sister-in-law who is clearly in crisis to bring you weird catered food from upstairs! Just wait!\n\nAlex: And this is where we get an explicitly implied gay sex scene in the bathroom because Matthew walks in and hears Taylor and gay brother grunting and banging on walls as they tried to get her fat suit on, and then Hugh walks out and it\u2019s like\u2026\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nSabrina: I was pleasantly surprised by Matthew\u2019s reaction to hearing what could only have been gay sex in the bathroom of his hotel lobby. He reacted like an ally! Or even a man who might be interested in trying some of that himself!\n\nAlex: I have to imagine that Matthew was at least a little bit curious!!! Given everything he\u2019s going through!!!\n\nKelsey: And also when it was revealed to be his man-crush Hugh Mann who was in there making these sounds, he was very professional and kind. Matthew is an ally.\n\nAlex: By this point, Tia has figured out a connection between Hugh and Taylor because she realized that Hugh had filled out his paperwork with her Social Security number, and she\u2019s like \u201ccheckmate to my nemesis.\u201d She wants to be the general manager of the resort and she thinks exposing Hugh will make Matthew look bad and secure the promotion for her. Which is incredibly misguided because when does sabotaging someone over an opportunity you were already passed over for work out in your favor? Also, these people think and talk about general managers so much more than anyone, ever.\n\nSabrina: After Tia accuses Taylor in front of the party, Taylor is feeling cornered. I thought she was going to do a Mission: Impossible unmasking, ripping off her Santa face and spraying the room with lentils, but then a hotel employee runs in asking for Taylor, because her daughter Zoey had a snowboarding accident. This stressed me out so much because presumably Sun Peaks is not offering their seasonal employee Hugh Mann health insurance??\n\nKelsey: God I wish the lentils had made a comeback!\n\nAlex: I do not ski for many reasons but chief among them is the risk of catastrophic injury, and when Zoey is on a stretcher with her neck in a neck brace I thought it was going to be so much worse than what turned out to be a sprained arm?\n\nSabrina: Yeah they really bait-and-switched us! When I saw the neck brace I was prepared for a worst-case scenario, and then like two scenes later she just is wearing a sling.\n\nKelsey: Insane that there was no concern about health insurance when she took a part-time job to pay for snowboarding school! I did really enjoy the scene though where Taylor forgets she is dressed as Santa and is comforting her injured daughter who is \u2026 so confused about why Santa is there.\n\nSabrina: That\u2019s finally when Hugh Mann unmasks to reveal himself as Taylor, leaving everyone shocked, but Matthew overall seemed pretty chill about it, which I appreciated. Taylor was like, I can explain! And Matthew was like, Your daughter is in a neck brace, which is more important than our situationship. I was a little confused why everyone was so mad about Taylor being Santa. Obviously it\u2019s not a good idea to have hired someone to work with children without doing a background check first, and employment fraud is probably bad, probably? But also I feel like there must be gender discrimination in the Santa industry, and would Taylor have been hired if she had been honest about being a woman?\n\nAlex: Yeah, if this happened in real life, in no universe does the heat come down on the beloved resort Santa. This is a local newspaper investigation into the hiring practices of the resort and how there are no background checks done.\n\nSabrina: This is where I have to be honest and say that the first evening I sat down and tried to watch this movie, I paused after 15 minutes to watch my favorite Christmas-adjacent movie of all time, Spotlight. It was a really good decision. And I returned to My Secret Santa when I had a more open, patient heart.\n\nUltimately Taylor and Matthew reconcile at some kind of unveiling with the same \u201cbig crowd\u201d of 20 extras who appear in every single crowd shot. She decides to walk on stage as Matthew is announcing something and then apologizes, and then Matthew finally admits that he was feeling sexual feelings toward Santa. I wish they had been able to have this conversation in private so that Taylor, as the sister of a gay brother, might have been able to shepherd him toward an understanding of his queerness. But no, they had to reconcile in front of a crowd so that everyone could clap when they kissed and then sing a \u201cpunk\u201d rendition of \"Run Rudolph Run\" that I simply do not believe was punk.\n\nKelsey: As a sister of a gay brother, you would think she would try harder! I agree!\n\nAlex: He does admit he misses Hugh, which makes me believe that there\u2019s room for this relationship to evolve with time.\n\nSabrina: That\u2019s right, Taylor, it\u2019s never too late to transition!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe movie closes with everyone at a Christmas party together smiling laughing whatever. Boring! Let Matthew kiss Hugh on his wizened old lips! Do you feel like you learned any lessons from this movie?\n\nAlex: I learned that it is impossible to be a present parent and also be successful at your career so you gotta choose one. Classic!\n\nKelsey: A lesson I learned is to never fill your fake belly with only lentils if it is not double lined. You need the lentils to be secure. What lessons did you learn?\n\nSabrina: I learned the lesson of Mamma Mia, which is that you should always tell your daughter about the band you were in when you were younger because it fosters a genuine and lasting connection between the two of you that can also help transfer intergenerational wisdom about financial planning (in this case from Zoey to Taylor). And I learned to never do winter sports without health insurance.",

      "full_content": "Are we as sure as we think we are that Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua has filled his school's institutional diaper by carrying on about the Fighting Irish being excluded from the college football playoff? Or is this just college football fans, and mostly those from the lower right quadrant of the nation, shrieking in glee at said diaper and its owner?\n\nWe're not exactly sure, to be honest, although it says something about the tone of it all that the metaphorical diaper is a constant. Despite its ongoing consolidation into sprawling gigaconferences, college football has never been a more regional sport than it is now, and a large part of the nation that's still invested in the whole Ponzi scheme likes the fact that everyone involved is pantloading in a frantically public way. As big a deal as Notre Dame football is\u2014and it is a big deal, if not quite as big a deal as it believes itself to be\u2014this is more about the chance to giggle and gawk at an embarrassing public spectacle than it is anything to do with the game itself.\n\nBut here we are anyway, on Day 4 of a two-day story, with Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark chastising Bevacqua for complaining about ACC commissioner Jim Phillips' inertia re: the ACC social media team's frantic promotion for the playoff candidacy of full member Miami instead of part member Notre Dame. That's a lot to follow, a proper pigpile of socially arrested suits moaning and groaning about each other. They are upset because their entire system is a Jenga tower wrapped in money and coated in maple syrup; they are complaining because that's more or less their raison d'etre.\n\nNotre Dame has always been an easy target for such fans and opponents because of the advantages it has blackjacked into being. Those include being an independent in the program's most lucrative sport and a conference member in all the others; having its own network; and the recent discovery that they can be grandfathered into the 2026 playoff simply by being ranked in the top 12 by the nitwit-powered playoff committee. Notre Dame is entitled because they are Notre Dame, but it is more salient in this case that the system has re-entitled them. As a result, Notre Dame when wronged is particularly squeally, and those who don't like them for those privileges (read: the rest of College Football America) will naturally be inclined to soak their feet in the bucket of Notre Dame's tears.\n\nBut if it were just that, we could all move on to some other seasonal gripe\u2014the fact that inflatable front yard Santas are not only a thing but a thing that costs $200, maybe. It isn't just that, though. College football is no longer about either college or football. It's certainly not about the players, who used to be student-athletes but now are working their way toward the drinking-age hell of being employees. College football is about itself, and more specifically about the act of consuming itself\u2014about being shouty about something or someone. We suspect that Bevacqua knows this in his way, just as the committee knew it in their context, and Lane Kiffin knew about it in his uniquely hyper-solipsistic way, and LSU knew it when it fired Brian Kelly, then unfired him so they could avoid paying him, then lost their interest in unfiring him when they found out they'd have to pay him anyway and fired him again. You can see this knowledge, which is cynical and sure and absolutely ice cold, in the way that coaches were being fired weekly for Snickers and giggles all season, and in USC and Michigan complaining that Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti is seeking out hedge fund operators to fuel college sports. Everyone knows their respective advantage and what they can get away with, and everyone is pressing their luck.\n\nIt's all adult-on-adult behavior, and the one thing youth culture has always gotten right is how utterly contemptible adults are when left to their own reflections. Commissioners? Athletic directors? Coaches? Hedge funds? How much closer to the bottom of the latrine are we this year than last?\n\nWhatever that distance, this is what college football wants to be now, and so we must presume what it will continue to be. People even hate the comparatively charming presences of Tulane and James Madison in the playoff as the business' last offering to the 100-some-odd schools left out of the SEC/Big Ten appropriation of the levers of power. Those people will likely be proven right, if annoying, when Tulane gets boatraced (again) by the de-Kiffinized Ole Miss and JMU gets pounded by Oregon. Those adults will complain about the playoff format for five days while the Tulane and JMU coaches flit off to their next jobs, and then everyone will get back to the bidness of bidness.\n\nWith all that as the backdrop, Notre Dame re-galvanizing the industry's Pavlovian hate against itself may actually be brilliant if self-parodic theatre, a reminder that, even in this churning mosh pit of soul-deficient moneygrubbers, there is one thing they can all agree upon. We prefer to think, then, that Pete Bevacqua saw the business tearing itself apart and imposed the power incumbent in his office as Chief Petty Officer Of The U.S.S. Fighting Irish to remind everyone of the one thing they can all agree upon\u2014hating Notre Dame for being so relentlessly, persistently and shamelessly Notre Dame. Bevacqua's sacrifice should be hailed as what it is, a brave act of falling on the grenade to save the rest of the platoon. The only real quibble we have is why anyone would bother to take one for this platoon, even or especially when it all just feels like friendly fire.",

It is true she endeavored to devour me, rend me limb from spotted limb, and yet, in my eyes, she had been perfect. Mayhap, I mused, I was not destined for love in this life, at least not the romantic kind, that full-body luminescence conjured when two hearts meet, mingle, and meld. O, the ecstasy of amplexus, are we fated never to touch?\n\nEnough! I can spare no more space in my heart for a vile temptress. Having escaped with everything but my dignity intact, I literally hopped with my proverbial tail betwixt my legs. I hankered for the comfort of home, that old familiar plastic cube in the laboratory, and knew thither I must go. These clinical strictures, which once felt suffocating, now offered me a sense of comfort, how wrapping yourself in a blanket is sometimes the closest you can come to being held.\n\nAnd so my days became humdrum once more. I splayed my webbed toes against the plastic and watched the others do what we frogs are known to do: sit, stare, and haphazardly hop. I felt no love for the beings whose enormous hands dropped mealworms into my cube, but at least the terms of our arrangement were clear and transactional. We each knew what we were getting from each other. I would not awake with horror to find my legs disappeared in their toothy and cavernous jaws.\n\nI became contented with this banal purgatory, the days multiplying like minced planaria. So when a detestable invertebrate was once again dropped without warning into my plastic box, when I heard its loathsome little wings battering the acrylic walls, I turned around without hesitation and opened my mouth to swallow the minibeast. After weeks of mealworms, I was ready for flavor and prepared for significant bodily harm. O wretched ambrosial bug, come into my mouth!\n\nShinji Sugiura\n\nWhen I opened my eyes to see my meal, horror coursed through the cold blood of my veins. I am no stranger to pain. I had survived the barbed penes of the mason wasp and the pestilential nectar of the bombardier beetle. But now I faced a nemesis I feared I could not vanquish. Time wavered as I realized that I now looked upon the northern giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia. Had I not been so hungry, I would have bowed my head in reverence to such a creature. This is the beast some call the murder hornet.\n\nWhat a predicament I have inflicted upon myself! Shinji Sugiura\n\nVerily, good reader, I had heard the horror stories. How its stinger slices through the dense barrier of a beekeeping suit as if it were nothing more than silk. How it slays four score bees a minute, decapitating each worker head by puny head. How a single prick of its venom can kill a mouse. How might the life of a mouse measure up to that of of a frog? The odds, I reasoned, were not in my favor. I thought I had stared Death in his wizened face before, felt his stale breath waft over my mortal soul, but I know now I had never been in any real danger. The mason wasp and bombardier beetle were mere hurdles, a way to test my thirst for the spice of life. But this, it dawned on me, would be my final test. Was this lonely frog ready to die?\n\nO Death, am I ready for your sweet embrace? Shinji Sugiura\n\nOf course I contemplated spitting out the hornet, wrenching it from my lips with the suctioned pads of my forelimbs. Yet my mouth rudely ignored my mind; my jaws clamped together as the creature thrashed in my throat. I thought of many things in these precious seconds that preceded the pain. I thought of my almost-love, my almost-killer. I thought of my youth in Honshu, whose green fields I remember only in dreams. Was it still my homeland, or had my home become this plastic cube? Had the fluorescent overhead lighting become my new sun, and these large-fingered scientists my pantheon of gods? 'Twould not be so bad to die like this, I reasoned, among the closest thing a frog has got to family. No need to mend a broken heart if it stops beating entirely. And so I waited, hornet in my jaws, thinking of my father\u2014had I ever met him, and did he look like me?\u2014and felt the Dreaded Puncture of my supper's stinger slicing through my flesh. Farewell, brutish world!\n\nCome, Reaper, I am ready for your embrace! Shinji Sugiura\n\nI waited, and waited, and waited, and as I waited this dastardly hornet stung me once more on my lip, and then my throat and face, and finally, my eyeball. This is when I began pleading with Death to come more expeditiously. Come Charon, here is my coin! Let me hop with the shades! Through my stung eye, I looked beyond the walls of my box to see if any of my fellow frogs bore witness to my expiration. But none spared me a second glance. My comrades were each in their boxes, munching on hornets of their own, and looking invariably unperturbed. What was the meaning of this? Were we not all put on Earth to die, put specifically in this laboratory to be murdered by way of hornet?\n\nAnd then I swallowed the hornet and felt fine. A cold sheen seeped from my mucus membrane as I realized that I was, against every expectation, going to live. (This also surprised the scientists.)\n\nFrog who is \"going to be okay.\" Shinji Sugiura\n\nIn that moment I understood the devil with which I had danced. I had almost given up the most precious gift a frog can have, because of what, exactly? Some failed romance? I was a fool to search for happiness in others before I could first find happiness in myself.\n\nI may be a frog alone in the world, but this is not such a tragedy. I have my two strong hindlimbs for hopping, my two dexterous forelimbs for pushing giant, wriggling hornets down my gullet. I have eyes that can see despite being repeatedly stung. I have a mind and a soul, one no more or less significant than any of the other beings around me in this lab. I have a story, which I am not ready to end. I am not ready to croak. Bring it on, life, give me more! Give me more taste, more experiences. Give me the moon and the stars! Give me more joy, more love, even more heartache, I am ready for it all! Whatever the webbed fingers of the heavens may throw at me next, I will open my mouth wide to guzzle the rapture and the pain, to be changed by what will change me. You know what I'm getting at. Another hornet, good sir!",

The Penguins took 47 shots to Anaheim's 28, had five power plays to the Ducks' one, enjoyed 80 percent of the game's high-danger scoring chances, and generally broke the Deserve To Win O'Meter. Yet it was the Ducks who came away with two points\u2014duck, duck, deuce?\u2014for they enjoy the inscrutable blessings of fate and physics.\n\nIt took a pair of miracles to get there, but that's simply the way the puck bounces when things are going good. The first came at the end of regulation\u2014the very, very end. 19:59.9 of the third period, to be precise, when the Ducks, down a goal, down a man but with their goalie pulled, skated in on a Pens defense that looked fairly prepared for the desperation attempt. But rookie Beckett Sennecke was allowed a shocking amount of room to maneuver on net (play the man, not the puck!) and attempted a short pass across the goalmouth that, had things gone according to Sennecke's plan, would have seen time expire. \"I wasn\u2019t really keeping track of the time,\u201d Sennecke admitted.\n\nBut the pass bounced off the hand of a sprawled Erik Karlsson and in, with 0.1 showing on the clock.\n\n\"It hit my hand and went in. There was no question about it,\u201d Karlsson said. \u201cHow it came to be that way, I don't really know.\" Yes! Join me in freeing yourself from the shackles of causality! This is the NHL in December, where nothing makes sense and nothing really matters. The Pens are an inexplicable 1-7 on games that make it to overtime? Sure, why not. The Ducks are 19-10-1, and have won three straight despite being down to their third and fourth goaltenders? Tell another one.\n\nVille Husso, said third-string netminder, is on a very Ducklike heater, in that he's winning game after game despite not playing a very good goal. He's allowed three or more goals in four of six starts since stepping in for the injured Lukas Dostal and Petr Mrazek, and he's 5-1 in those games. A representative bit of Husso magic came in overtime, when Sidney Crosby along the goal line pushed a lovely pass out to Tommy Novak in the opposite circle for the one-timer. An off-balance Husso reached out with his stick ... and didn't get anywhere near it.\n\nIt's tough to see, even on replays, but Novak's shot hit the post and rode up Husso's stick, and he deposited it in an only slightly less dangerous part of the crease, until it was fortuitously cleared away. I'm not sure Husso really did anything here, let alone earned the \"save of the year\" caption, but all that ultimately matters is straightforward enough to be described to a caveman, and puck no go in.\n\nLeo Carlsson's first-round shootout goal stood up, as Husso added three more stops to go with his 44 saves.\n\nHusso has likened the Ducks' hot start\u2014and we're past a third of the way through the season, so this is more than a fluke\u2014to the Blues' Stanley Cup run he enjoyed from the bench in 2019. \"I feel like there\u2019s a lot of similar stuff happening here. The atmosphere and everything. The rink is buzzing. Fans are excited. Everything is just like clicking.\" Do not underestimate the power of buzzing and clicking. Something weird and fun is happening here.\n\n",

      "full_content": "With the Notre Dame Fighting Irish neither playing in the College Football Playoff (CFP) nor competing in a bowl game, head coach Marcus Freeman has more time on his hands, time the New York Giants would reportedly like to use to pry him away from South Bend.\n\nEven before the world learned Sunday that Notre Dame would be excluded from this year\u2019s playoff, rumors had begun to swirl that Freeman would be high on the Giants\u2019 wishlist, as that organization works to fill their head coaching vacancy. Those rumors got a boost when ESPN NFL reporter Adam Schefter confirmed that Freeman was among the G-Men\u2019s top targets.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, FS1 host Colin Cowherd asked legendary Florida and Ohio State coach Urban Meyer, who also coached briefly in the NFL, what advice he would have for him when choosing between the NFL and Notre Dame.\n\nMeyer was direct.\n\n\u201cI would say, \u2018You stay in college 100 percent.\u2019 You have controllables in college as a head coach. In the NFL, there\u2019s so many uncontrollables that you don\u2019t have, whether it\u2019s the GM, the owner\u2026In college, it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlus, you\u2019re gonna lose in the NFL. It\u2019s built- and I\u2019m not sure the Marcus I know. He can\u2019t take losing like I can\u2019t take losing. You\u2019re gonna win at Notre Dame,\u201d Meyer cautioned.\n\nFreeman\u2019s NFL experience is limited. He never coached in the league, but bounced around on the practice squads of the Bills, Bears, and Texans, before a diagnosis of an enlarged heart ended his NFL career.\n\nNotre Dame is not unaware that its coach, perhaps the best young coach in college football, is a favorite target of potentially several NFL teams. On Tuesday, Notre Dame Athletic Director Pete Bevacqua spoke at length on the podcast The Echoes about ensuring that Freeman would be among the highest-paid college coaches for years to come.\n\nThe Irish are certainly hoping that the promise of financial reward and the chance to avenge the CFP\u2019s snub with a national championship is enough to ease any talk of Freeman making the jump to the NFL.",

That was the joint response from Muslim-majority Egypt and Iran, two Middle East nations where homosexuality is illegal, venting their fury Tuesday that FIFA has scheduled a 2026 World Cup soccer match in Seattle that overlaps LGBTQI+ Pride events.\n\nThe fixture on June 26 next year has been designated by local organisers as a \u201cPride Match\u201d to coincide with Seattle\u2019s Pride weekend, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nEgypt and Iran are now furiously protesting because that cause affronts their Islamic sensibilities alongside \u201cthe cultural and social values\u201d they hold.\n\nEgypt\u2019s soccer federation issued a statement late Tuesday saying it sent a letter to FIFA \u201ccategorically rejecting any activities related to supporting homosexuality during the match.\u201d\n\nSeattle PrideFest has been organized in the city since 2007 by a nonprofit which designated the June 26 game for celebration before FIFA made the World Cup draw Friday, AP reports.\n\nFIFA chose Saturday to allocate the Egypt-Iran game to Seattle instead of Vancouver, where the teams\u2019 group rivals Belgium and New Zealand will play at the same time.\n\n\u201cWith matches on Juneteenth and pride, we get to show the world that in Seattle, everyone is welcome,\u201d Seattle\u2019s Mayor-elect Kate Wilson wrote on social media. \u201cWhat an incredible honor!\u201d\n\nThe AP report notes FIFA controls only stadiums and official fan zones in World Cup host cities and should have no formal authority over community events like Seattle PrideFest.\n\nIn Iran, where gays and lesbians can face the death penalty, the president of Iran\u2019s Football Federation Mehdi Taj attacked the match during an interview aired on state television.\n\nTaj said Iran would bring up the issue during a FIFA Council meeting in Qatar next week. The longest-serving member of the 37-person council chaired by FIFA President Gianni Infantino is Egypt\u2019s Hany Abo Rida.\n\n\u201cBoth Egypt and we have objected, because this is an unreasonable and illogical move that essentially signals support for a particular group, and we must definitely address this point,\u201d Taj said. State TV on Tuesday confirmed a complaint would be sent to FIFA.\n\nThe Egypt soccer federation led by Ado Rida said of the pride events it \u201ccompletely rejects such activities, which directly contradict the cultural, religious and social values in the region, especially in Arab and Islamic societies.\u201d\n\nThe 2026 World Cup is set to be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026.\n\nRead the AP report in full here",

I\u2019m on the National Football Foundation Board, so I hear firsthand from a lot of the commissioners and athletic directors and the people involved in all of that. It\u2019s gotta get cleaned up, first and foremost,\" Aikman <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6869981/2025/12/09/troy-aikman-espn-mnfl-nfl-joe-buck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">told The Athletic.</a></p><p>When asked about student-athletes\u2019 mobility in today\u2019s world, Aikman reflected on his personal choices during his time competing at the NCAA level.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-great-troy-aikman-fires-back-jerry-jones-trade-plan-amid-losing-effort-he-may-want-cancel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>NFL GREAT TROY AIKMAN FIRES BACK AT JERRY JONES' TRADE PLAN AMID LOSING EFFORT: 'HE MAY WANT TO CANCEL'</strong></a></p><p>\"I was a transfer. I went from Oklahoma to UCLA, and I\u2019ve always felt that if a coach is able to pick up and leave, that a player should have the same opportunity if a coach leaves,\" he continued.</p><p>\"What\u2019s happened obviously over the years since I got out of college football is that, in recent years with NIL, there\u2019s been no accountability on the players,\" Aikman continued. \"So, the players pick up, and now they\u2019re leaving all the time whereas before it was typically the coach. The player used to have to sit out a year. Now, the players can up and go regardless of whether or not they\u2019ve been paid. It\u2019s every man for himself.\"</p><p>Aikman then dived into another college football hot topic \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lane-kiffin-leaves-ole-miss-lsu-college-football-coaching-shakeup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lane Kiffin\u2019s decision to leave</a> Ole Miss in favor of LSU. The NFL analyst gave his best guess on what fueled Kiffin to make the leap.</p><p>\"Lane Kiffin\u2019s motivation? Is it his thoughts that it\u2019s a better opportunity for him at LSU? Possibly. Is it money? Possibly. Is it lifestyle? Possibly. I can\u2019t answer any of those questions.</p><p>\"But whatever his motivation is, he feels like LSU is the right place for him. So, I don\u2019t fault him for that at all. I know there\u2019s always hard feelings. Ole Miss did not want to lose Lane Kiffin,\" he said. \"Once he made the decision to leave, now he\u2019s a pariah. Let\u2019s get this guy just as far away from us as we can. I understand that as well. Everybody gets a little bit jaded.\"</p><p>Aikman concluded that those in positions of power should ultimately take charge and focus on getting things in order.\u00a0</p><p>\"Where I\u2019m at is I think there\u2019s gotta be some leadership at the very top that kind of cleans all of this up. Starting with players that accept money, there\u2019s gotta be some accountability and responsibility on their behalf to have to stick with a program,\" Aikman said.</p><p>\"I gave money to a kid. I won\u2019t mention who. I\u2019ve done it one time at UCLA. Never met the young man. He was there a year. He left after the year. I wrote a sizable check, and he went to another school. I didn\u2019t even get so much as a thank-you note.\"</p><p>Aikman is scheduled to be on the call for a Week 15 matchup between the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> and Miami Dolphins Dec. 15.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s </strong></i><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

It\u2019s gotta get cleaned up, first and foremost,\" Aikman <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6869981/2025/12/09/troy-aikman-espn-mnfl-nfl-joe-buck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">told The Athletic.</a></p><p>When asked about student-athletes\u2019 mobility in today\u2019s world, Aikman reflected on his personal choices during his time competing at the NCAA level.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-great-troy-aikman-fires-back-jerry-jones-trade-plan-amid-losing-effort-he-may-want-cancel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>NFL GREAT TROY AIKMAN FIRES BACK AT JERRY JONES' TRADE PLAN AMID LOSING EFFORT: 'HE MAY WANT TO CANCEL'</strong></a></p><p>\"I was a transfer. I went from Oklahoma to UCLA, and I\u2019ve always felt that if a coach is able to pick up and leave, that a player should have the same opportunity if a coach leaves,\" he continued.</p><p>\"What\u2019s happened obviously over the years since I got out of college football is that, in recent years with NIL, there\u2019s been no accountability on the players,\" Aikman continued. \"So, the players pick up, and now they\u2019re leaving all the time whereas before it was typically the coach. The player used to have to sit out a year. Now, the players can up and go regardless of whether or not they\u2019ve been paid. It\u2019s every man for himself.\"</p><p>Aikman then dived into another college football hot topic \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lane-kiffin-leaves-ole-miss-lsu-college-football-coaching-shakeup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lane Kiffin\u2019s decision to leave</a> Ole Miss in favor of LSU. The NFL analyst gave his best guess on what fueled Kiffin to make the leap.</p><p>\"Lane Kiffin\u2019s motivation? Is it his thoughts that it\u2019s a better opportunity for him at LSU? Possibly. Is it money? Possibly. Is it lifestyle? Possibly. I can\u2019t answer any of those questions.</p><p>\"But whatever his motivation is, he feels like LSU is the right place for him. So, I don\u2019t fault him for that at all. I know there\u2019s always hard feelings. Ole Miss did not want to lose Lane Kiffin,\" he said. \"Once he made the decision to leave, now he\u2019s a pariah. Let\u2019s get this guy just as far away from us as we can. I understand that as well. Everybody gets a little bit jaded.\"</p><p>Aikman concluded that those in positions of power should ultimately take charge and focus on getting things in order.\u00a0</p><p>\"Where I\u2019m at is I think there\u2019s gotta be some leadership at the very top that kind of cleans all of this up. Starting with players that accept money, there\u2019s gotta be some accountability and responsibility on their behalf to have to stick with a program,\" Aikman said.</p><p>\"I gave money to a kid. I won\u2019t mention who. I\u2019ve done it one time at UCLA. Never met the young man. He was there a year. He left after the year. I wrote a sizable check, and he went to another school. I didn\u2019t even get so much as a thank-you note.\"</p><p>Aikman is scheduled to be on the call for a Week 15 matchup between the <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> and Miami Dolphins Dec. 15.</p><p><i><strong>Follow Fox News Digital\u2019s </strong></i><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong>sports coverage on X</strong></i></a><i><strong>, and subscribe to</strong></i><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><strong> the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p>",

      "full_content": "Their team lost.\n\nEight teen football players from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were arrested on theft charges in Florida after being caught in a brazen \"conspiracy\" to steal thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise from a Dick's Sporting Goods. The juvenile suspects had traveled to Polk County, Florida, to participate in the Prolifix Nationals tournament at the time of their apprehensions.\n\n\n\nThe Polk County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) said in a press release that the incident occurred just hours before the teens were scheduled to participate in the championship game. They were handcuffed instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately 10:55 am on December 6, a store manager at the Dick's Sporting Goods in Davenport contacted the sheriff's office \"after observing multiple juveniles concealing merchandise.\" PCSO deputies arrived on scene and detained all eight football players.According to authorities, the suspects split into two groups to carry out the conspiracy. Marcus Hudgens, 15, made a purchase near the front of the store and then approached his teammates, who were walking around inside. Hudgens opened his Dick's Sporting Goods bag, and the other suspects placed merchandise inside it.Daimon Johnson, 15, Mark Bryan, 15, and Ibn Mahdee Abdul Haqq, 14, then exited the store with the bag full of stolen merchandise. They were arrested upon exit. Abdul-Haqq allegedly had stolen merchandise concealed inside a black backpack, while Bryan was in possession of the bag from the store that consisted of more than $2,000 worth of stolen goods. The other five suspects were detained inside the store. This included Hudgens, Elijah Myers, 14, Tymir Speller, 15, Tymir Smith, 14, and Jacob Scott, 15. Authorities discovered a beanie hidden inside Speller's pants when he was detained, according to the press release.Photo Polk County Sheriff's OfficeThe eight teens were identified as members of the United Thoroughbreds, a youth football team located in Philadelphia. The total value of stolen merchandise totaled $2,296.07.\"These juveniles were not from Polk County, they came here from Philly for a football tournament, and instead of representing their team with pride, they chose to steal - they are Thoroughbred thieves,\" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who shamed the players in a press conference. \"Let this be clear: it doesn't matter if you're from here or visiting, if you break the law in Polk County, you will be arrested and held accountable.\"The team's coach, Raekwon Bynes, 29, responded to the store and confirmed to authorities that the teens were staying in Davenport for the championship game, the sheriff's office said. The eight suspects had no prior criminal histories and declined to provide statements to authorities. The players were transported to the Juvenile Assessment Center, and each was charged with retail theft and conspiracy to commit retail theft.Sheriff Judd congratulated the opposing team for defeating the Thoroughbreds in the championship game, stating that the Coco Tigers didn't just win but \"ran over them.\" The Thoroughbreds lost the game 26-6.",

      "content": "<div class=\"FeatureByline\">\n           By <b>Joe Brockmeier</b><br>December 10, 2025</br>\n           </div>\n<p>Linux containers have made it reasonably easy to develop, distribute, and\ndeploy server applications along with all the distribution dependencies that they\nneed. For example, anyone can deploy and run a Debian-based <a\nhref=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres\">PostgreSQL container</a> \non a Fedora&#160;Linux host. <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/\">Distrobox</a> is a project that is designed to\nbring the cross-distribution compatibility to the desktop and allow users to\nmix-and-match Linux distributions without fussing with dual-booting, virtual\nmachines, or multiple computers. It is an ideal way to install\nadditional software on image-based systems, such as Fedora's <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/\">Atomic Desktops</a>\nor <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1046228/\">Bazzite</a>, and also\nprovides a convenient way to move a development environment or\nfavorite applications to a new system.</p>\n\n<p>Distrobox creator Luca Di Maio <a\nhref=\"https://fedoramagazine.org/run-distrobox-on-fedora-linux/\">was\ninspired</a> by the <a href=\"https://containertoolbx.org/doc/\">Toolbx</a>\nproject (formerly Container Toolbox) for Fedora. Generally, the idea with Linux\ncontainers is to run processes in their own environment to isolate them as much\nas possible from the host without having to resort to virtual machines\nwith their additional overhead. It is possible, though, to set up a container to give it privileged\naccess to the system with little to no isolation. This is typically referred to\nas a <a\nhref=\"https://www.baeldung.com/linux/privileged-container-capabilities#privileged-containers\">privileged\ncontainer</a>.\nIt is possible to set up privileged containers manually, but it requires the\nuser to know a great deal about working with containers and some fairly involved\nsetup. The original goal for Toolbx was to let users run a privileged container\n\"toolbox\" on image-based systems that could be used for system administration\nand troubleshooting without having to include administration utilities in the\nimage itself.</p>\n\n<p>Toolbx has a somewhat limited scope: it works best with specific container images and was primarily developed to provide a software toolbox for\nimage-based Fedora editions like <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/\">CoreOS</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/\">Silverblue</a>. Toolbx is also\nlimited to the <a href=\"https://podman.io/\">Podman</a> container manager, which\nis not ideal for those who prefer to use <a\nhref=\"https://www.docker.com/get-started/\">Docker</a>. Di Maio wanted to have\nbroader compatibility with other Linux distributions as host operating systems\nas well as the ability to use a wide range of container images. He published the\nfirst release, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.0.0\">Distrobox&#160;1.0.0</a>,\nin December&#160;2021, under the GPLv3.</p>\n\n<p>The Distrobox project is, as its homepage notes, \"<q>a fancy\nwrapper</q>\" that works with Docker and Podman, with di Maio's own minimal\ncontainer manager, <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/lilipod?tab=readme-ov-file#lilipod\">Lilipod</a>,\nas a fallback if the others are not present. Distrobox is written in POSIX\nshell, so that it is as portable as possible. The <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#aims\">project's\nprimary goal</a> is to allow the use of any Linux distribution containers on any\nLinux distribution host running one of the supported container managers. It also\nhas a goal of entering a container as quickly as possible, \"<q>every millisecond\nadds up if you use the container as your default environment for your\nterminal</q>\".</p>\n\n<p>Di&#160;Maio notes in the project's README that isolation and\nsandboxing of applications are non-goals: \"<q>on the contrary it aims\nto tightly integrate the container with the host</q>\". This means that\ncontainers run by Distrobox have access to the user's home directory, external\nstorage, USB devices, audio devices, and more. The idea of a sandboxed\nmode for Distrobox <a href=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28\">was\ndiscussed</a> but di&#160;Maio ultimately <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/28#issuecomment-2408529939\">decided\nagainst</a> implementing one and has <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/pull/1806#issuecomment-3219301182\">opted\nnot to take patches</a> attempting to add isolation features: \"<q>the focus of\ndistrobox is not isolation, security or stuff, but integration and transparency\nwith the host</q>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\n\n<p>Distrobox is packaged for most popular Linux distributions, and the project\nhas a <a href=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#host-distros\">compatibility\ntable of host distributions</a> for those it has been tested on. The table \nhas notes with additional instructions if necessary. There is a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/compatibility/#containers-distros\">table of guest\ndistributions</a> as well that lists the container images that have been successfully\ntested with Distrobox. If a distribution is not mentioned in the host or guest\ntable it does not mean that Distrobox will not work; it simply indicates that\nthe combinations have not been tested. Users will also need one of the supported\ncontainer managers installed as well.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of how and why one might use Distrobox: the <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/#signal\">Signal</a> project only provides <a\nhref=\"https://signal.org/download/linux/\">packages for Debian-based\ndistributions</a>, so there are no official packages for Arch, Fedora, openSUSE,\nor other non-Debian systems. There is a Flatpak available, but\nit is not maintained by the Signal project itself. It is possible to \ncompile Signal from source, but it is far easier to create a Debian Distrobox and\ninstall the official Signal package there:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox create -i debian:trixie -n signal -H ~/distrobox/signal\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox enter signal\n</pre>\n\n<p>The first command tells <tt>distrobox</tt> to create a new\ncontainer using the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> image with its home directory set to\n<tt>~/distrobox/signal</tt>, and to name it \"signal\". If the\n<tt>debian:trixie</tt> container image is not already present on the\nsystem, Distrobox will ask if you want to download it. Note that\nDistrobox uses the system's settings for short-name container\nlookup; it is also possible to pass the full registry path to\n<tt>distrobox</tt> if one prefers. The second command tells it to\nopen a shell inside the container (or <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-enter/\">enter</a> the container) so\none can work within its environment.</p>\n\n<p>All of that will probably look quite\nfamiliar to folks who work with Linux containers regularly, but\nDistrobox is doing quite a bit more behind the scenes. The\n\"<tt>--dry-run</tt>\" (or <span class=\"nobreak\">just \"<tt>-d</tt>\"</span>) option will print out the\ncommand that \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox create</tt></span>\" is\npassing to the container manager for inspection, without taking any\nactions. It's worth eyeballing the output to see what goes into\nsetting up a container that's well-integrated with the host system. In\nthe case of the example command here, there are more than 50 options\npassed to <tt>podman</tt>, including 17 volume mounts. That is a lot\nof container magic that the user is not required to fuss with or know\nabout, unless they want to.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things it does is to set up passwordless <tt>sudo</tt>\ninside the container, so one can immediately install packages in the container and so\nforth. Note that, by default, Distrobox executes the user's login\nshell when entering a container, but <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/useful_tips/#use-a-different-shell-than-the-host\">this\ncan be changed</a> if one wants to use (say) the Fish shell on the\nhost system but GNU Bash inside a Distrobox container.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of setting a home directory is not to provide isolation from the\nuser's home directory, but to avoid clutter. If no home directory is specified,\nthe guest container will <span class=\"nobreak\">use <tt>~/</tt></span>; that may be undesirable if one wants\nto maintain a separate set of configuration files or project directories in a\nDistrobox. Applications and processes in the Distrobox will still be able to\naccess files under the user's normal home directory. For example, if\nDistrobox container is set up with its home as\n<tt>/home/user/distrobox/signal</tt> then that will be set as\n<tt>$HOME</tt> for applications within the container. However, the\napplications can still access files in <tt>/home/user</tt>,\n<tt>/home/user/Documents</tt>, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>The <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-create/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;create</tt></a>\nman page provides a number of useful examples to help getting\nstarted. The \"<tt>distrobox&#160;create&#160;-C</tt>\" command will provide a\ncurrent list of images that are considered compatible with Distrobox. If a\ncontainer image is not listed as compatible, that does not mean it won't work,\njust that it has not been tested and confirmed to work.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, Distroboxes can be destroyed as well as created: \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox rm\n<em>name</em></tt></span>\" will remove a container. That does <em>not</em>,\nhowever, remove the container image from the system. If the goal is to\ncompletely purge the container image as well, then it's necessary to use the\ncontainer manager to do so, e.g. \"<tt>podman&#160;rmi&#160;<em>imagename</em></tt>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Exporting applications and moving containers</h4>\n\n<p>Since Distrobox is often used to run desktop applications, it does not make\nsense to have to enter the Distrobox container each time one wants to run Signal or some\nother application. The project provides a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-export/\">distrobox-export</a> command that sets\nup a <tt>.desktop</tt> file to launch the command directly from one's\ndesktop. For example, this will create a launcher for the Signal desktop client:\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox-export --app signal-desktop\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that the command should be run from within the container\ncreated by Distrobox, not on the host. Assuming that\nthe user is running a desktop environment like GNOME, KDE, or Xfce, an entry for\nSignal should show up in whatever menu or launcher is being used. Now it's not\nnecessary to use \"<tt>distrobox&#160;enter</tt>\" at all to run Signal, it can be\nrun like any other desktop application that is installed on the\nhost. Even though Distrobox prioritizes speed in starting containers,\nthere is usually a small but noticeable lag when launching an application from\na container that hasn't started yet.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, one might want to use a Distrobox container as their\nprimary command-line environment. Some terminal emulators, such as <a\nhref=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis#ptyxis-your-container-oriented-terminal-for-gnome\">Ptyxis</a>,\noffer integration with Distrobox and other container tools; a user can\nset Ptyxis to open new terminal windows in the container\nautomatically. This is particularly handy on image-based systems where\none cannot install software directly on the host using APT or DNF. I\nset Ptyxis to use a Fedora container by default and do my work in the\ncontainer and install additional software therein. To distinguish\nbetween working in the host terminal and in my default container, I\nset the color palette to \"Borland\" from the <a\nhref=\"https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/\">Gogh</a> set of color schemes\nfor terminals. The old-school look is appealing, and I don't get it\nconfused with the black-on-green theme for regular terminals.</p>\n\n<p>The \"<a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-assemble/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt></a>\"\ncommand can automate the creation of one or more Distroboxes. It takes\nan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">INI file</a> with\nspecifications on how to create a new container or multiple\ncontainers. For example, this is a simple <tt>distrobox.ini</tt> that\nwould create a container using a Fedora Rawhide image with several\npackages that I use regularly. The <tt>pull=true</tt> option tells\n<tt>distrobox</tt> to go ahead and pull the container image if it is\nnot available on the system.</p>\n\n<pre>\n    [rawhide]\n    additional_packages=\"emacs emacs-pgtk aerc tmux git lolcat bat\"\n    image=fedora:rawhide\n    pull=true\n    home=/home/jzb/distrobox/rawhide\n</pre>\n\n<p>Jorge Castro has written a <a\nhref=\"https://www.ypsidanger.com/declaring-your-own-personal-distroboxes/\">good\nblog post</a> on using \"<tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt>\" that is\nworth reading for anyone using Distrobox.</p>\n\n<p>The project is not on a time-based schedule, so releases are\nsomewhat sporadic. There is also no roadmap to follow for future\nreleases. Generally, Distrobox seems mostly feature complete, so\nnew versions seem to be mostly about bug fixes or catching up to\nchanges in Linux distributions and container tooling. The most recent\nfeature release was <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.0\">version&#160;1.8.2.0</a>\non October&#160;28 which included Bash completion enhancements, added\nsupport for new guest distributions, and included quite a few\ndocumentation changes as well as bug fixes. With that release,\ndi&#160;Maio also announced the addition of Alessio Biancalana as a\nmaintainer, and Biancalana has headed up the recent minor\nreleases. The most recent is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.2\">1.8.2.2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project does not, unfortunately, have a mailing list or even a web forum:\nthe documentation points users to a <a\nhref=\"https://matrix.to/#/%23distrobox:matrix.org\">Matrix room</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://t.me/distrobox_chat_new\">Telegram group</a> instead. Users\ninterested in making contributions or reporting bugs should check <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\"><tt>CONTRIBUTING.md</tt></a>\nfor guidance.</p>\n\n<p>I've found Distrobox to be enormously useful for providing an easy and quick\nway to run multiple distributions on a single system. Distrobox is probably one\nof my most-used applications after Firefox and Emacs. Multiple versions of Alpine Linux,\nCentOS&#160;Stream, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and others are just a few\nkeystrokes away any time I need them.</p>\n\n</p>",

That is a lot\nof container magic that the user is not required to fuss with or know\nabout, unless they want to.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things it does is to set up passwordless <tt>sudo</tt>\ninside the container, so one can immediately install packages in the container and so\nforth. Note that, by default, Distrobox executes the user's login\nshell when entering a container, but <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/useful_tips/#use-a-different-shell-than-the-host\">this\ncan be changed</a> if one wants to use (say) the Fish shell on the\nhost system but GNU Bash inside a Distrobox container.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of setting a home directory is not to provide isolation from the\nuser's home directory, but to avoid clutter. If no home directory is specified,\nthe guest container will <span class=\"nobreak\">use <tt>~/</tt></span>; that may be undesirable if one wants\nto maintain a separate set of configuration files or project directories in a\nDistrobox. Applications and processes in the Distrobox will still be able to\naccess files under the user's normal home directory. For example, if\nDistrobox container is set up with its home as\n<tt>/home/user/distrobox/signal</tt> then that will be set as\n<tt>$HOME</tt> for applications within the container. However, the\napplications can still access files in <tt>/home/user</tt>,\n<tt>/home/user/Documents</tt>, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>The <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-create/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;create</tt></a>\nman page provides a number of useful examples to help getting\nstarted. The \"<tt>distrobox&#160;create&#160;-C</tt>\" command will provide a\ncurrent list of images that are considered compatible with Distrobox. If a\ncontainer image is not listed as compatible, that does not mean it won't work,\njust that it has not been tested and confirmed to work.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, Distroboxes can be destroyed as well as created: \"<span class=\"nobreak\"><tt>distrobox rm\n<em>name</em></tt></span>\" will remove a container. That does <em>not</em>,\nhowever, remove the container image from the system. If the goal is to\ncompletely purge the container image as well, then it's necessary to use the\ncontainer manager to do so, e.g. \"<tt>podman&#160;rmi&#160;<em>imagename</em></tt>\".</p>\n\n<h4>Exporting applications and moving containers</h4>\n\n<p>Since Distrobox is often used to run desktop applications, it does not make\nsense to have to enter the Distrobox container each time one wants to run Signal or some\nother application. The project provides a <a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-export/\">distrobox-export</a> command that sets\nup a <tt>.desktop</tt> file to launch the command directly from one's\ndesktop. For example, this will create a launcher for the Signal desktop client:\n\n<pre>\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;$ distrobox-export --app signal-desktop\n</pre>\n\n<p>Note that the command should be run from within the container\ncreated by Distrobox, not on the host. Assuming that\nthe user is running a desktop environment like GNOME, KDE, or Xfce, an entry for\nSignal should show up in whatever menu or launcher is being used. Now it's not\nnecessary to use \"<tt>distrobox&#160;enter</tt>\" at all to run Signal, it can be\nrun like any other desktop application that is installed on the\nhost. Even though Distrobox prioritizes speed in starting containers,\nthere is usually a small but noticeable lag when launching an application from\na container that hasn't started yet.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, one might want to use a Distrobox container as their\nprimary command-line environment. Some terminal emulators, such as <a\nhref=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/chergert/ptyxis#ptyxis-your-container-oriented-terminal-for-gnome\">Ptyxis</a>,\noffer integration with Distrobox and other container tools; a user can\nset Ptyxis to open new terminal windows in the container\nautomatically. This is particularly handy on image-based systems where\none cannot install software directly on the host using APT or DNF. I\nset Ptyxis to use a Fedora container by default and do my work in the\ncontainer and install additional software therein. To distinguish\nbetween working in the host terminal and in my default container, I\nset the color palette to \"Borland\" from the <a\nhref=\"https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/\">Gogh</a> set of color schemes\nfor terminals. The old-school look is appealing, and I don't get it\nconfused with the black-on-green theme for regular terminals.</p>\n\n<p>The \"<a\nhref=\"https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-assemble/\"><tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt></a>\"\ncommand can automate the creation of one or more Distroboxes. It takes\nan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file\">INI file</a> with\nspecifications on how to create a new container or multiple\ncontainers. For example, this is a simple <tt>distrobox.ini</tt> that\nwould create a container using a Fedora Rawhide image with several\npackages that I use regularly. The <tt>pull=true</tt> option tells\n<tt>distrobox</tt> to go ahead and pull the container image if it is\nnot available on the system.</p>\n\n<pre>\n    [rawhide]\n    additional_packages=\"emacs emacs-pgtk aerc tmux git lolcat bat\"\n    image=fedora:rawhide\n    pull=true\n    home=/home/jzb/distrobox/rawhide\n</pre>\n\n<p>Jorge Castro has written a <a\nhref=\"https://www.ypsidanger.com/declaring-your-own-personal-distroboxes/\">good\nblog post</a> on using \"<tt>distrobox&#160;assemble</tt>\" that is\nworth reading for anyone using Distrobox.</p>\n\n<p>The project is not on a time-based schedule, so releases are\nsomewhat sporadic. There is also no roadmap to follow for future\nreleases. Generally, Distrobox seems mostly feature complete, so\nnew versions seem to be mostly about bug fixes or catching up to\nchanges in Linux distributions and container tooling. The most recent\nfeature release was <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.0\">version&#160;1.8.2.0</a>\non October&#160;28 which included Bash completion enhancements, added\nsupport for new guest distributions, and included quite a few\ndocumentation changes as well as bug fixes. With that release,\ndi&#160;Maio also announced the addition of Alessio Biancalana as a\nmaintainer, and Biancalana has headed up the recent minor\nreleases. The most recent is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/releases/tag/1.8.2.2\">1.8.2.2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The project does not, unfortunately, have a mailing list or even a web forum:\nthe documentation points users to a <a\nhref=\"https://matrix.to/#/%23distrobox:matrix.org\">Matrix room</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://t.me/distrobox_chat_new\">Telegram group</a> instead. Users\ninterested in making contributions or reporting bugs should check <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\"><tt>CONTRIBUTING.md</tt></a>\nfor guidance.</p>\n\n<p>I've found Distrobox to be enormously useful for providing an easy and quick\nway to run multiple distributions on a single system. Distrobox is probably one\nof my most-used applications after Firefox and Emacs. Multiple versions of Alpine Linux,\nCentOS&#160;Stream, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and others are just a few\nkeystrokes away any time I need them.</p>\n\n</p>",

While Nvidia is barred from dealing with Inspur or its blacklisted subsidiaries, the restrictions don\u2019t extend to U.S.-based entities like Aivres, allowing the business relationship to continue. Aivres finds an overseas buyer for high-end Nvidia servers: In mid-2024, Aivres negotiated a $100 million deal to sell 32 Nvidia GB200 server racks - containing roughly 2,300 Blackwell-generation chips - to Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison\u2019s cloud-computing division in Indonesia. Indosat is jointly owned by Qatar\u2019s Ooredoo and Hong Kong\u2019s CK Hutchison. The Indonesian buyer lines up a Chinese AI startup as the end user: Indosat agreed to purchase the servers only after securing a major client facilitated by Aivres: Shanghai-based AI startup INF Tech. Negotiations also included representatives from Fudan University, where INF\u2019s founder, Qi Yuan, directs an AI institute. The Chinese startup intends to use the chips for finance and medical AI: By October, the servers had arrived in Indonesia and were being set up. INF plans to use the computing power to train AI models for financial analytics and scientific research, including drug-discovery applications.\n\nAccording to attorneys familiar with export-control rules, as long as the Chinese company isn't directly using the chips to help China with military intelligence or weapons of mass destruction, the arrangement doesn't violate any laws set by the Trump administration.\n\nNvidia has responded to The Information, telling the outlet in a written statement: \"We haven\u2019t seen any substantiation or received tips of \u2018phantom data centers\u2019 constructed to deceive us and our [server manufacturing] partners, then deconstructed, smuggled and reconstructed somewhere else. While such smuggling seems farfetched, we pursue any tip we receive.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the company has developed a software feature to track the location of its chips - which could help the company combat chip smuggling, Reuters reported Wednesday. If this feature becomes live, it could 'severely cripple' the use of smuggled chips in China.",

He is known as an activist. Likely what they were really after wasn't memes, but his contacts, as the AG has stated unequivocally that she is going to be going after activists who hold positions the current administration doesn't like. \n\nThis is the new McCarthyism, and is absolutely an assault on the First Amendment.",

        "u/MarvelsGrantMan136: Bateman:\n\n&gt;\u201dI read all the reviews. I am doing these projects for public consumption, so it matters to me what the public thinks about them. It matters to me what critics think about them. But what\u2019s most important is that the weather inside is 72 and breezy. It takes a lot of work to stay happy, to stay clear, and to be proud of yourself. You can try to drink through it, but you\u2019re sober in the morning and you got to live in those hours too.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201dI got a terrible review from The New York Times on the pilot of \u2018Ozark.\u2019 Mike Hale basically said I was so boring to watch, it reminded him of the person that he buys a ticket from in the airport. I laughed my ass off. I appreciate those that get creative with it.\u201d",
        "u/Scoob8877: Part of the point of the pilot is that he was in a fog, going through the motions. His wife was cheating on him and his partner had him mixed up in some shady stuff. He played that really well.",
        "u/Turbulent_Tale6497: I remember a story when a new iPhone was coming out.  Maybe the 11?  I don't know.  \n\nBateman was up early in the morning, and waiting in line just like everyone else at the Apple Store LA.  An Apple guy came out to get him, to let him in early, and he acted honestly surprised, he was totally fine waiting his turn.\n\nI think the dude is pretty real",
        "u/davetbison: As an actor I\u2019ve always thought of Jason Bateman as a sort of magician\u2019s magician. \n\nI know he\u2019s acting, but he\u2019s so good at it that I can\u2019t figure *how* he does it.",
        "u/AKindleSoul: Can't remember the last time I heavily disagreed with something as this take. Jason is phenomenal in everything he is in, and not to mention the insane range he has. Arrested Development and Ozark are litreally day and night in their differences and he nails both those roles perfectly.",
        "u/HoneyShaft: Last season deserves the hate though. So much build up for a thud landing.",
        "u/ActualAssistant2531: I had to stop watching Ozark because it gave me anxiety.",
        "u/KCMmmmm: I watched maybe two season of Ozark.  The acting was fine, but I did get sick of the blue filter.",
        "u/TedBundysVlkswagon: Too bad Jason Bateman is a fucking national treasure. I\u2019m not really the type of person to be star struck, but man it would be cool to chill with that dude.",
        "u/StoneShadow812: I thought the acting was fine just hated the absolutely garbage ending that made me feel like I wasted my time."
